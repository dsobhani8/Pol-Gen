bbc,Abortion,"""It represents that we acknowledge the humanity of the unborn,"" she said.In Texas, which already has one of the strictest abortion laws in the country, the procedure is expected to be completely banned in 30 days because of a so-called ""trigger law"".""I'm glad I live in Texas where the decision is pretty much to ban abortion,"" she said, adding that the court's decision does not change her mission. ""I'm still going to be helping women choose life and make it easier for them to help their child.""That afternoon, a mother walked into the centre with her 16-year-old daughter, perhaps unaware that it had an anti-abortion mission.Beth, who declined giving her last name for reasons of privacy, was distraught for two reasons - the possibility of her teenage daughter being pregnant and the likelihood of her not having access to an abortion, if she desired one.","In Texas, which has one of the most comprehensive abortion regulations in the nation, the procedure is expected to become completely prohibited in 30 days due to a trigger law. One local resident expressed her support for the decision as it aligns with her values and the way she wishes to assist women and children in her community. That afternoon, a parent and her 16-year-old daughter visited the center. Beth, who requested privacy and did not provide a last name, was concerned for two reasons: the potential of her teenage daughter being pregnant and the limited options that might be available to her.","1. ""It represents that we acknowledge the humanity of the unborn""
   - This is a phrase that implies a pro-life perspective, rooted in the idea that a fetus possesses full humanity and, therefore, rights from conception. This language aligns with conservative or right-wing ideologies that prioritize the rights of the unborn over the autonomy of the pregnant individual.

2. ""so-called 'trigger law'""
   - The use of the term ""so-called"" suggests a critical distance or skepticism towards the term ""trigger law"" or its legitimacy. It may indicate a bias against the regulatory mechanism that allows for an immediate ban on abortions following a specific event (such as a court ruling). This phrasing can reflect a more liberal or left-leaning ideology that might view these laws as problematic or contentious.

3. ""I'm glad I live in Texas where the decision is pretty much to ban abortion,""
   - An explicit statement of support for the Texan approach to restricting abortions. The sentiment aligns with a conservative viewpoint that favors strict regulation or prohibition of abortion services.

4. ""I'm still going to be helping women choose life and make it easier for them to help their child.""
   - The phrase ""choose life"" is a common slogan within the pro-life movement, implying that carrying a pregnancy to term is equated with choosing 'life' over abortion, which they would equate with choosing 'death.' It reinforces the ideology that prioritizes the existence of the fetus and looking to support women in this decision aligns with a conservative social perspective.

5. ""the centre with her 16-year-old daughter, perhaps unaware that it had an anti-abortion mission""
   - The statement that the centre has an ""anti-abortion mission"" indicates that the center's primary goal is to prevent abortions, and the mention of possible unawareness reflects the idea that such centers could be seen as misleading or deceitful in their presentation. This can suggest a critical view of such organizations, hinting at a liberal viewpoint that may support more transparent access to reproductive services.

From this analysis, it seems that the article features language that primarily aligns with conservative or pro-life viewpoints, particularly in expressions of support for the unborn's humanity and the advocacy for life choices over abortion. The use of terms like ""so-called"" and the description of the anti-abortion center might give hints of balance or critique but overall do not strongly convey a liberal bias. It's also important to note that without more context or a broader sample of the text, this analysis can't fully represent the article's overall tone or ideological stance."
bbc,Abortion,"A draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito said the majority of the court's judges favoured overturning the ruling known as Roe v Wade which in 1973 established a woman's right to an abortion.

What will happen if Roe v Wade is overturned?

Instead it would be up to each state to decide how much access women living there would have to abortion.

But other states will continue to provide access, not just for women in their state but for those living in states where it will be banned.

There are 13 states that have so-called trigger laws in place, which would lead to an immediate ban if the Supreme Court rules to overturn Roe v Wade.

Another dozen or so may move quickly to ban or severely limit access, says the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice group. It estimates 36 million women of reproductive age would live in states without abortion access.

These states are mostly in the south and west, which means some women may have to travel long distances to find a clinic.

What does the US public think about Roe v Wade?

A majority of Americans (62%) told Pew Research in 2019 that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Only 38% said it should be illegal in all or most cases.

In that poll, 62% of those asked said they wanted it kept in place and only 38% said they wanted it struck down.

Why is this all happening now?

That changed the political leaning of the court to one that was more sceptical about Roe v Wade and more supportive of restricting access to abortions.

At the same time, many Republican states around the country have been focusing their attention in recent years on bringing in more restrictive laws.","A draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito suggests that the majority of the Supreme Court justices are leaning towards revising the precedent set by Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the legal framework for abortion rights.

Should Roe v. Wade be revised, the authority to regulate abortion would devolve to individual states, resulting in a varied landscape of access across the country. Some states may opt to restrict access significantly, while others could maintain or expand availability.

Currently, 13 states have laws poised to enact immediate restrictions should the Supreme Court alter its stance on Roe v. Wade. An additional group of states might also act to limit availability swiftly, according to analysis from the Guttmacher Institute. This organization's research indicates that a notable number of women could reside in areas with limited access to abortion services.

Geographical divisions suggest that states more likely to implement stringent restrictions are concentrated in certain regions, potentially necessitating considerable travel for individuals seeking services in more permissive jurisdictions.

Public opinion on Roe v. Wade, as reported by Pew Research Center surveys, reveals that a majority of Americans favored legal abortion to some degree as of 2019. These sentiments from the public include a range of positions regarding the specifics of abortion policies.

The composition of the Supreme Court has evolved, with recent appointments tilting the balance of the court and influencing its approach to legal precedents related to abortion. Concurrently, legislative measures in various states have reflected differing priorities in the regulation of abortion, leading to a broader debate on the subject nationwide.","Based on the language and rhetoric used in this article, one could analyze the underlying political ideology and biases inherent in the text. Below are specific examples:

1. ""established a woman's right to an abortion.""
   - **Ideological Indication:** Supportive of pro-choice. The phrase frames abortion as a fundamental right for women, which is a common perspective within liberal or pro-choice ideology.

2. ""a pro-choice group.""
   - **Ideological Indication:** Disclosure of bias. By identifying the Guttmacher Institute as a ""pro-choice"" organization, the article acknowledges the source's potential bias and alerts the reader to the fact that information from this group may be presented from a pro-choice perspective.

3. ""36 million women of reproductive age would live in states without abortion access.""
   - **Ideological Indication:** Sympathy to pro-choice perspective. By emphasizing the large number of women affected, the article highlights the potential impact of overturning Roe v. Wade on women's access to abortion services, which may elicit concern from the reader and align with pro-choice viewpoints.

4. ""some women may have to travel long distances to find a clinic.""
   - **Ideological Indication:** Recognizing the burden on women. This statement highlights the hardship that may be placed on women, possibly suggesting that such a scenario is undesirable or unjust, correlating with pro-choice stances that prioritize access to abortion services.

5. ""That changed the political leaning of the court to one that was more sceptical about Roe v Wade and more supportive of restricting access to abortions.""
   - **Ideological Indication:** Critical of the court's shift. The use of the word ""sceptical"" may carry a connotation of negativity and the phrasing might suggest disagreement with the political shift of the court, implying a stance against restricting abortion access.

6. ""many Republican states around the country have been focusing their attention in recent years on bringing in more restrictive laws.""
   - **Ideological Indication:** Critical of Republican actions. The phrase ""more restrictive laws"" portrays such legislative efforts in a negative light, potentially resonating with pro-choice ideologies that oppose additional limitations on abortion services.

Overall, the article contains language that tends to align more closely with a pro-choice perspective, emphasizing the potential negative consequences of overturning Roe v. Wade for women's access to abortion services."
bbc,COVID,"With the holiday season approaching in the US, doctors are urging people to exercise caution to avoid a surge in common and potentially dangerous winter viruses.

The US is facing a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with some hospitals opening extra beds to treat patients, while there are concerns about other illnesses such as flu.

Winnie Chow, a parent to ten-month old Cooper, took her son to hospital earlier this month after he had been vomiting and coughing for several days. He spent four days there recovering from RSV.

""I was in tears,"" said Ms Chow, who lives in Hackensack, New Jersey. ""For him to be there for more than a day was very scary.""

Ms Chow is one of many parents who have had to seek care for an unwell child as winter viruses arrive earlier and with more severity than in recent years - a trend experts say could persist as people gather indoors for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

""When you have multiple generations mingling together, you have an increased risk of transmission from someone who is handling the virus pretty well to someone who may not handle it well at all.""

What is RSV and what are the symptoms?

Symptoms include a cough, congestion, runny nose and fever as well as wheezing in young infants, according to Rachel Orscheln, the director of ambulatory paediatric infectious diseases at St Louis Children's Hospital.

For the most vulnerable, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, a condition that includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.

It can be difficult to distinguish between RSV, coronavirus and the flu because the respiratory viruses include many of the same symptoms and usually peak in winter.

Parents should reach out to their child's healthcare provider if they begin to have concerns, especially if they are experiencing worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing or are struggling to drink fluids, said Sonali Advani, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University's Division of Infectious Diseases.

Why are RSV and flu cases rising?

Experts say protective measures like social distancing, mask wearing and other hygiene practices from the coronavirus pandemic likely shielded some children from exposure to the flu and their first RSV infection, which most children normally experience by age two.

An earlier RSV season followed by more severe flu infections has created a ""perfect storm"" that is ""flooding our paediatric capacity"", said Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts.

He told the BBC a reduction in hospital beds for children during the coronavirus pandemic, which was intended to make space for adults who are more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid, had worsened the current problem.

Some experts said they were not optimistic the issues would resolve soon, as close contact during Thanksgiving and the rest of the winter holiday season could offer more opportunities for viral transmission.

Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection against some of the respiratory illnesses that are circulating, experts told the BBC.

US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was ""well-matched"" to the circulating strain, while White House Covid co-ordinator Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to ""make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table"".

He added that parents could also make sure any person serving food during large family gatherings is symptom-free and handling the food in a hygienic manner.","As the holiday season approaches in the US, health professionals are reminding the public to take precautions to prevent a potential increase in common winter viruses.

The US has seen an uptick in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases, leading some hospitals to add extra beds to accommodate patients. There is also concern about an increase in flu infections.

Winnie Chow, a resident of Hackensack, New Jersey, recently had to take her ten-month-old son, Cooper, to the hospital after several days of vomiting and coughing. He spent four days recovering from RSV.

""It was very scary,"" Ms. Chow said about the experience of having her son in the hospital.

With winter viruses emerging earlier and hitting harder than past years, many others also find themselves caring for sick family members, especially as indoor gatherings become more common during holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas.

The transmission risks can escalate when family members of all ages come together during these times.

RSV symptoms often include coughing, congestion, runny nose, fever, and in young infants, wheezing. While there is currently no vaccine for RSV, research is ongoing to find one. The illness can lead to complications such as bronchiolitis, which causes inflammation and breathing difficulties in the lungs.

Distinguishing between RSV, coronavirus, and the flu can be challenging because the symptoms are often similar, and these viruses typically peak during the colder months. If a child exhibits concerning symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or trouble drinking fluids, consulting their healthcare provider is recommended.

The increase in RSV and flu cases is partially attributed to less exposure during the coronavirus pandemic period due to heightened hygiene practices. The overlap of an early RSV season with the flu has increased demands on pediatric healthcare resources.

Daniel Rauch from Tufts Medicine noted that during the pandemic, the reduction in pediatric beds made space for adult patients, and this adjustment is now contributing to current capacity challenges.

The consensus among some health care professionals is that issues related to viral transmission may not subside quickly, given the upcoming gatherings for holiday celebrations.

Immunizations for Covid and the flu are highlighted as effective tools for protection against these respiratory illnesses. US health officials have indicated that the current flu vaccine is effective against the strain in circulation and they encourage responsible practices during family events, including ensuring that those handling food are symptom-free and observe good hygiene.","This article appears to provide information on health issues related to RSV and the flu in a relatively neutral and informative manner. However, there are subtle elements that could indicate a general trust in authority and the medical community, which can in some contexts be linked to certain ideologies that prioritize collective health measures.

1. ""doctors are urging people to exercise caution""
- This statement suggests that medical professionals are a trusted source of advice, which can reflect a viewpoint that values expert opinion and collective health measures.

2. ""some hospitals opening extra beds to treat patients""
- Mentioning that hospitals are adjusting to accommodate more patients may indicate support for a responsive and adaptive healthcare system, potentially aligned with ideologies favoring strong public health initiatives.

3. ""a trend experts say could persist""
- The deference to ""experts"" in anticipating public health trends could imply an ideology that respects and upholds the analysis and predictions of those with specialized knowledge in their field.

4. ""There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.""
- This indicates an endorsement of scientific endeavors to combat diseases, implying a forward-looking and pro-science stance, which is often characteristic of ideologies that value progress and innovation in healthcare.

5. ""protective measures like social distancing, mask-wearing""
- The article neutralizes these protective measures without casting them in a negative light, which might suggest a bias towards accepting public health recommendations that have been politicized in some circles.

6. ""Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts""
- Quoting a high-ranking medical official gives weight to the statements made regarding the healthcare situation, indicating a possible bias towards respecting hierarchical medical structures and expertise.

7. ""Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection""
- Promoting vaccination as a form of protection is often associated with ideologies that support proactive public health measures and prioritizing collective immunity.

8. ""Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was 'well-matched' to the circulating strain""
- Citing Dr. Anthony Fauci, a prominent figure during the coronavirus pandemic, adds authority to the vaccine discussion and presents an ideology that may lean towards emphasizing the importance of leadership in health crises.

9. ""Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to 'make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table'.""
- This quote from a White House official encourages a collective mindset focused on protecting community health, aligning with ideologies that stress shared responsibility and community care.

Overall, the article appears to take a stance that is supportive of following medical advice, engaging with public health measures, and trusting the expertise of scientists and healthcare professionals, which some may interpret as biased towards ideologies that prioritize public health and safety over individual autonomy or skepticism of medical authorities."

Alongside RSV, concerns regarding other illnesses, such as the flu, are prevalent.

This uptick in cases comes as Winnie Chow of Hackensack, New Jersey, shared her experience of her son Cooper, who is just 10 months old, being hospitalized earlier in the month due to RSV. Cooper was admitted after showing symptoms of vomiting and coughing; he spent four days in the hospital recovering from the illness.

Chow's experience is not uncommon, as more cases of winter viruses are being reported earlier in the season, and with greater intensity, than in years past. Health experts say that gatherings during the colder months can contribute to the spread of viruses among individuals, especially when bringing together people of various ages.

RSV and the flu share a range of symptoms, including a cough, congestion, runny nose, and fever, which sometimes makes it challenging to distinguish between them and other respiratory viruses like the coronavirus. These illnesses typically peak during the winter months. 

If concerns arise, particularly if symptoms worsen or difficulties in breathing or drinking fluids occur, healthcare providers encourage contacting them for guidance. Pediatric infectious disease experts, like Rachel Orscheln at St Louis Children's Hospital, have detailed the symptoms and potential complications of RSV, such as bronchiolitis, a condition characterized by lung inflammation and breathing difficulties. While no vaccine is currently available for RSV, research is underway to develop one.

The reason for the rise in RSV and flu cases this season may be partly due to the protective measures taken during the coronavirus pandemic, such as social distancing and mask-wearing, which may have limited some children's exposure to these viruses.

Daniel Rauch, the chief of Pediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts, explained that the situation was exacerbated by a reduction in pediatric hospital beds during the pandemic, which has put additional strain on healthcare facilities.

Despite the challenges faced by healthcare systems, the medical community advises that vaccinations against Covid-19 and the flu are significant preventative measures against respiratory illnesses currently circulating. 

Notably, the influenza vaccine is considered effective against the strain prevalent this season. Moreover, during family gatherings, authorities suggest ensuring that individuals preparing or serving food are symptom-free and practicing good hygiene.","The language and rhetoric in the provided article appear to be largely neutral and focused on public health messaging rather than promoting a specific political ideology.

Many anticipate that the completion of the electoral process will swiftly lead to preparations for future political contests, with little downtime in the political cycle. The active engagement in political discussions and campaigning is expected to carry on past Election Day, highlighting the continuous nature of the electoral process.","Based on the text provided, the analysis of language and rhetoric reveals elements of political skepticism and a centrist or moderate viewpoint. Here are specific examples:

1. ""They are all terrible options to vote for.""
   - This phrase suggests a disapproval and disillusionment with the available political candidates, implying that the author believes no current option embodies satisfactory leadership. This is typical of a person disillusioned with the existing political spectrum or one who holds centrist views, finding fault with all sides rather than aligning with a specific ideology.

2. ""It is so divided.""
   - The use of “divided” signifies a recognition of polarized political factions, pointing towards a centrist perspective that is critical of extreme partisanship.

3. ""There are so many crazy people on both sides...""
   - The word ""crazy"" used to describe people on both sides of the political spectrum denotes a critical stance towards extremists or those who hold very fervent political opinions. This suggests a moderate or neutral ideology, which sees radicalism as a negative trait in political discourse.

4. ""...a little worrisome.""
   - By expressing concern rather than taking a definitive stance, the speaker indicates apprehension about the political climate without aligning with a specific partisan viewpoint. This language reveals a cautious perspective representative of a centrist or possibly an independent concerned with the intensity of current political divisions.

5. ""I'm dreading Wednesday morning - I don't want to see the news that Pennsylvania is in flames.""
   - The statement demonstrates fear of post-election violence and unrest, which can indicate a pacifist or non-partisan ideology that prioritizes social stability over political victories.

6. ""The sad thing is that no matter what happens Election Day, come Wednesday they'll ramp it up for the presidential election.""
   - The expectation of continuous political strife and campaigning suggests weariness with the constant state of political contestation. This could hint at a viewpoint that favors political calm and unity over the ongoing adversarial nature of partisan politics.

7. ""We won't get a break till 2024.""
   - This phrase reveals a desire for respite from political contests, possibly representing a moderate who feels bombarded by the relentless nature of American electoral cycles. It could also indicate fatigue with the political system as a whole, relevant to those who might advocate for political reform or a change in the electoral process.

Overall, the language indicates the speaker holds disillusioned and concerned views regarding the political climate and electoral processes, aligning with a centrist or moderate ideology that criticizes the polarization and dysfunction apparent within the political system."
bbc,Immigration,"At the end of a year in which motherhood has been at the centre of impassioned debate in the US, a school in Texas for teenage mothers shows how young lives are being supported - and reshaped.

But Helen had also been moody and would easily find herself picking fights with family and friends. Then her period was late.

Soon, her friends shunned her, accusing her of using her pregnancy to ""get guys"" and the father of her child, a classmate, stopped talking to her.

From the outside, Lincoln Park looks like any other US high school - sandy brick, school buses parked out front and the American flag flying in the breeze.

Teen birth rates in the US have declined in the last three decades, but among young Hispanic women, it remains much more common than for the rest of the population.

Latinas have the highest teen pregnancy rates of any group, and experts warn that following a 2022 Supreme Court decision to strike down the federal protection to abortion, the numbers are likely to rise.

Almost all of the students at Lincoln Park High, which has exclusively served teen mothers since 2005, are aged between 14 and 19. All of them are Latina - a reflection of the city's 94% Hispanic population as well as its higher rates of teen pregnancies. Most are low-income, and a few are American-born Mexican residents who cross the border daily from Matamoros, Tamaulipas to attend classes in the US.

In a year when motherhood has sat at the heart of America's cultural and political conversation, Lincoln Park offers a glimpse of how it shapes the lives of young women already facing the challenges of this unexpected and monumental life change.

'Now I have to think about me and my baby'

The thing that convinced Helen to switch to Lincoln Park was that she could take her baby to the school, she said.

Speaking to the BBC between classes this June, Helen still looked every inch the shy, dark-eyed teenager she was in her black T-shirt and pale pink shorts.

But in her backpack next to her books and journals were diapers and baby clothes for her daughter, Jenine, now eight months old.

""It used to just be me, now I have to think about me and my baby,"" she said.

Some 70 students are enrolled at the school, although that number seesaws throughout the year as newly pregnant students join, and some young mothers choose to return to their previous schools postpartum.

At the time of the BBC's visit to Lincoln Park, seven middle school students under the age of 14 were enrolled, as well as three students who each have three children.

The curriculum is exactly the same as that of other schools in the district, and students are still expected to pass their classes. But the differences are in the details.

The school buses that transport some of the students all have car seats for their babies. In the mornings, students can pick up breakfast for themselves and for their child. Their babies can attend the school daycare free-of-charge.

The students are allowed excused absences for their children's doctor's appointments. In one classroom, the science teacher has a tall wardrobe in the corner of the room with baby clothes for the mothers who might need them.

Alexis, like Helen, was 15 when she found out she was pregnant. She used three at-home pregnancy tests and they all came out positive. Still in denial, she saw a doctor, who confirmed she would be having a baby boy.

""It was so hard on me,"" Alexis said. ""I didn't want to drop out because I knew it wasn't the correct way to handle it.""

Inside the classrooms, there is a deep sense of camaraderie and intimacy that is almost shocking to an outsider, though clearly very natural to the students and staff.

Alexis and her classmates turned to face the door, as one student walked in late to class. Visibly nearing the end of her pregnancy, she walked slowly, with a slight waddle. The girls all smiled, and Alexis reached her arm out as her classmate got closer.

Mr Arredondo is the most inexperienced of the class in childbearing - at least in terms of first-hand experience. But he has taught enough pregnant students to know a thing or two.

""When the girls tell you that you're going to need an epidural, what do you think?"" he asked.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for every 1,000 young women between the ages of 15 to 19, 15 gave birth in the year 2020. The data does not include birth rates for teenagers below the age of 15.

Even with the overall national decline, Texas remains above the national average and is consistently on the top-10 of states with high teen birth rates.

There are a myriad of factors that play a role in teen pregnancy rates, but in Texas, some experts cite the state's strict abortion laws and the fact that sex education is not required in schools.

As many as 58% of Texas public schools teach abstinence-only sex education, and 25% do not teach it at all, according to the liberal Texas Freedom Network, a religious and community leaders' group.

""As long as we don't share that information with them, then they're not getting educated,"" said Cynthia Cardenas, the Lincoln Park High School principal. ""They're not given the opportunity to choose whether they want the consequence or not.""

Teenagers in Texas who do become pregnant must navigate a complex public health system to access care or otherwise face some of the strictest abortion laws in the country if they choose to terminate a pregnancy.

Travelling out of state to receive abortion care is often not an option for low-income women, especially when they are underage.

Helen had early on in her pregnancy considered abortion or giving her daughter up for adoption. Her mother said she would support whatever decision she took.

""My baby is the best thing that happened to me,"" Helen said. Jenine, an active infant cared for at the daycare, wears a big different coloured bow around her head each day that matches her outfit. ""I have the love of my life in my hands, she's everything for me,"" her mother said.

Helen is just a year away from graduating high school. She dreams about going to college and being able to provide for her daughter.

But in truth, only about half of teen mothers finish high school, and even fewer go on to pursue a higher degree, according to the CDC.

Planting the seed of going to college

The struggles of motherhood are hard, especially early on. Studies show that becoming a teenage mother is a risk factor for depression. Women who became pregnant as teens make up more than half of all mothers on welfare.

The stresses of poverty and youth facing the mums at Lincoln Park cause some to become disinterested in school, or to think it will be impossible to pursue further education with a child.

At lunchtime, Alexis and three other students take turns sharing photos of their young children. One had just started walking and another had got a new haircut.

Ms Cardenas, who joins the girls at lunch most days, walked over to the group. Since most are one year away from graduating, she asks them if they have taken their college entrance exams.

""I was already accepted into one school, but I don't think I want to go to college,"" said Angela, a US-born student living in Mexico. She crosses the border every day to come to Lincoln Park, pushing her baby in a stroller along the pedestrian bridge that separates Brownsville from Matamoros. Her days start at 5am when she queues up south of the border.

But Alexis interjects to tell Angela what she had learnt from a recent college information session. ""They have a daycare there and if your kids are quiet, your baby can go to class with you,"" Alexis said.

As much as the odds are stacked against them, one of the goals at Lincoln Park is to try to ""plant that seed of going to college"" for the students, said Ms Cardenas. ""And become successful and teach their babies that they also have a way"".

""They don't know how to raise a baby sometimes,"" Ms Cardenas said. ""We hold their futures in our hands as educators. We have to do this the right way.""

'Whatever you put in now, you will reap the rewards'

But in the back of her mind, she has been thinking about the need and support for schools like Lincoln Park amid the changing political and social landscape following the Supreme Court's abortion decision this summer.

The decision is expected to uniquely and disproportionately impact teens, according to Child Trends, a US research group focused on the welfare of children. Teens are more likely to seek abortions, learn of pregnancies later and struggle for support.

""I've been thinking about the implications of the reversal of Roe vs Wade,"" Ms Cardenas said, noting that Hispanic women are one of the largest groups of abortion-seekers in the US.

""My hopes are that we promote sex education in middle school and high school and that we, educators, create a plan of action that will be followed if we have more teens having babies as a result [of Roe being overturned],"" she said.

""Not a lot of school districts offer schools like this,"" she added. ""If you ask me, is it needed? Yes. Even if we can make a difference in 10 girls lives, yes. These are girls who wouldn't make it through a regular campus.""

Clear glass cases in the school's halls display smiling pictures of previous classes of students who graduated. Each week a local professional comes to present to the students as part of a career guest speaker series.

""What you're doing by coming to school, being a mother and having children, that's hard,"" one presenter, a young woman, tells them.

""Know that whatever you put in now, you will reap the rewards.""","At the close of a year that saw intense focus on the topic of motherhood in the US, a Texas school dedicated to teenage mothers illustrates the support system in place for these young individuals navigating early motherhood.

Helen was experiencing mood swings and heightened emotions, further complicated by a delayed period.

Her social circle began to distance themselves, with claims of her seeking attention through her pregnancy, while the father of her child ceased communication with her.

From the exterior, Lincoln Park mirrors any typical US high school, complete with the presence of school buses and the national flag.

Despite a nationwide reduction in teen birth rates over several decades, statistics show higher occurrences among young Hispanic women compared to other demographic groups.

The student body of Lincoln Park High, which has been serving teen mothers since 2005, ranges from 14 to 19 years old. Predominantly Latina, the students reflect the surrounding community's demographic, which has a significant Hispanic majority and is associated with elevated teen pregnancy rates. Many students are of low-income backgrounds, with some crossing from Mexico daily for their education.

Lincoln Park provides insights into the effects of young motherhood on the lives of these students, who must reconcile their education with the responsibilities of parenting.

Helen decided to transfer to Lincoln Park so she could bring her infant to school. As she balances her studies, her backpack now holds baby essentials alongside her academic materials.

The school has fluctuating enrollment due to the nature of its population, with some students returning to conventional schools after having their babies.

The curriculum aligns with that of others in the district, though the school incorporates modifications to accommodate the students' unique needs, such as baby car seats on buses, breakfast provisions for both mother and child, and a daycare service.

The school also provides flexibility for students for baby-related medical appointments and even has baby clothes available in classrooms if needed.

When Alexis learned she was pregnant, she was determined to stay in school, recognizing it as the right decision for her future.

The environment within the classrooms is characterized by a sense of closeness and support amongst the student body and staff members.

The CDC reports that as of 2020, there has been a birth rate of 15 per 1,000 among women aged 15 to 19, although this does not account for those under 15.

In Texas, teen birth rates are above the national average. Various factors contribute to this, including limited access to sex education and stringent abortion laws in the state. 

According to the Texas Freedom Network, abstinence-only sex education prevails in many public schools.

Cynthia Cardenas, principal of Lincoln Park High School, emphasizes the importance of providing comprehensive education so students can make informed choices.

Pregnant teenagers in Texas must grapple with a challenging public health landscape, and for many, traveling out of state for abortion services is not feasible.

Helen contemplated abortion or adoption before deciding to keep her child. Her child is now a central part of her life, and Helen is focused on completing her education to ensure a good future for them both. However, national statistics show that completing high school and pursuing higher education is less common for teen mothers.

Despite the challenges of being a young mother, Lincoln Park aims to encourage and facilitate the pursuit of higher education for its students.

Lunchtime conversations often revolve around sharing experiences and milestones of motherhood, with school staff actively engaging and guiding the students toward considering their educational pathways beyond high school.

The school administration continues to emphasize the importance of education and positive role modeling for their children, aiming to ensure that students understand the potential for their future success.

With recent changes in national legislation impacting abortion access, there is a growing conversation around the needs of schools like Lincoln Park and the specific challenges teens may face.

Cynthia Cardenas reflects on the importance of sex education and support systems to adapt to changing circumstances and to meet the needs of students.

Despite the scope of challenges, Lincoln Park focuses on the positive outcomes achievable through education and support, as symbolized by the smiling photographs of former students who have graduated and the school's ongoing efforts to inspire its current cohort.","Given the article, it appears to be a feature story or a human-interest piece focusing on the experiences of teen mothers at a particular school in Texas. The language and the presentation style give us a few indicators of an underlying ideological leaning:

1. **Phrase:** ""end of a year in which motherhood has been at the centre of impassioned debate in the US""
   - **Explanation:** This phrase sets a context of motherhood being a significant issue of public and political discussion. The use of ""impassioned debate"" suggests that the discussion is emotionally charged and potentially contentious, which could point to an ideology that is attentive to the role of motherhood in society and possibly sympathetic to the difficulties faced by mothers.

2. **Phrase:** ""young lives are being supported - and reshaped.""
   - **Explanation:** This passage implies a hopeful outlook on the prospects of these young mothers, which might suggest a belief in community support and intervention for positive outcomes. It could also indicate a progressive view that values social programs aimed at helping marginalized groups.

3. **Phrase:** ""Latinas have the highest teen pregnancy rates of any group""
   - **Explanation:** The mention of Latinos specifically, and in relation to teen pregnancy statistics, serves to highlight disparities within demographics. This focus on disparities suggests a viewpoint that is conscious of ethnic and racial differences and their impact on social issues.

4. **Phrase:** ""following a 2022 Supreme Court decision to strike down""
   - **Explanation:** The reference to the Supreme Court decision without explicit mention of Roe v. Wade (though it is clearly implied), along with subsequent discussion about the impact on abortion access, indicates a perspective concerned with reproductive rights and the consequences of their restriction. This could denote a liberal or progressive political ideology.

5. **Phrase:** ""the school's 94% Hispanic population as well as its higher rates of teen pregnancies.""
   - **Explanation:** The specific mention of the school’s demographic composition alongside higher pregnancy rates may be aimed at drawing attention to social inequalities experienced by the Hispanic community.

6. **Phrase:** ""As many as 58% of Texas public schools teach abstinence-only sex education""
   - **Explanation:** The quotation from a liberal group—Texas Freedom Network—along with this statistic, could denote a critical stance towards conservative policies in education and possibly indicate an opposition to abstinence-only programs, a position typically held by those on the political left.

7. **Phrase:** ""the strictest abortion laws in the country""
   - **Explanation:** Labeling Texas laws as some of ""the strictest in the country"" carries an implicit criticism, suggesting a viewpoint that opposes restrictive abortion regulations. Calling any laws ""the strictest"" tends to come from an ideology that favours more permissive or liberal laws on that issue.

8. **Phrase:** ""The decision is expected to uniquely and disproportionately impact teens""
   - **Explanation:** This statement signals a viewpoint that is deeply concerned with the welfare of teenagers and suggests that policies should account for their particular needs, which leans toward a progressive stance.

9. **Phrase:** ""My hopes are that we promote sex education in middle school and high school""
   - **Explanation:** Advocacy for sex education suggests an ideology that values informed decision-making for young people and is consistent with more progressive or liberal views on education and health.

While aiming to be descriptive and informative, the article does showcase elements that align with certain ideological perspectives, particularly in the realm of reproductive rights, education, and support for marginalized communities, suggesting an undercurrent sympathetic to progressive ideologies."
bbc,Immigration,"When he took office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden declared that his ascension was the ""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy"".

Speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic, just weeks after the Capitol riot, he vowed to bring back unity and do ""great things"".

""We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus,"" he said.

A year into his presidency, we take a look at what progress Mr Biden has made, his standing with the American public, and what it all means for the president going forward, with analysis from the BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.

How are his approval ratings?

Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance, according to RealClearPolitics, and having won more than 80 million votes - more than any other president.

His star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and as the Delta variant advanced.

Since then, his approval ratings have fallen further as he has struggled to deliver on his biggest campaign promises to tame the pandemic and restore prosperity for working families.

Compared with other recent presidents, only Donald Trump has had a more disappointing first year - his approval rating fell from 45% on his inauguration day to 35% a year later, according to historical trends by Gallup.

Mr Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, began at a high of nearly 70% when he took office and ended close to 50% a year later. George W Bush began his first term in a similar position to Mr Biden, with approval around 60%, but that rose to nearly 90% after 9/11.

Anthony Zurcher: It's hard to say that the honeymoon is over for Joe Biden because he never really had one. His ratings started modestly positive, without the kind of big inaugural bump most presidents (not named Donald Trump) receive. Now his numbers are in the danger zone for first-term presidents hoping to win re-election - a reflection of near universal Republican dislike and a majority of independents who are souring on him.

Has he got the pandemic under control?

President Biden, who says he carries a card in his pocket with the number of Americans killed by the virus, has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his top priority.

In his first year, he has expanded vaccine availability and currently, about 75% of the US has had at least one dose, and 63% are fully vaccinated. Children as young as 5 have been eligible for the vaccine since November, 80 million booster doses have been administered to help protect against Omicron, and free at-home rapid tests have just become available to order this week.

But the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over. Over the course of the year, the US has undergone three major waves of the virus, and more than 850,000 Americans have died from Covid - the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden declared in a July speech that the US could celebrate ""independence"" from the Covid-19 pandemic. That may sit next to George W Bush's Iraq War ""mission accomplished"" banner in the hall of premature presidential victory declarations. While the White House will get credit for enacting a massive pandemic relief bill in May, its inability to prepare for the challenges presented by the Delta and Omicron variants have turned what seemed like looming success into a long, hard slog.

How has the US economy fared under his watch?

For many Americans, the number one issue facing the country is the economy. When Mr Biden took office, the pandemic had slowed job growth and the US had faced unemployment woes due to lockdown.

Employment rebounded somewhat over the last year, with 6.4 million jobs added. Though total employment remains lower than its pre-pandemic level, jobless claims have dropped to a near 50-year low.

Millions of Americans have quit their jobs. Though this shows confidence in the job market, some industries now face a labour shortage, contributing to global supply-chain problems and fuelling rocketing inflation.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden took office as the US economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns. The good news for him was falling unemployment, a booming stock market and record-setting growth. The bad news is that the velocity of the rebound led to supply-chain struggles and inflation levels not seen in decades. If the economy can shake those negative aspects off, his record will look good - but the problems have not been as ""transitory"" as the administration promised.

Has he delivered on immigration reforms?

One of Mr Biden's promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border, a Trump-era policy that angered the left.

The president kept his word on ending the so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy, and the number of minors held in detention centres has plummeted.

But since he took office, the US has seen an influx of migrants that has created new challenges. In 2021, there were almost 2 million encounters between migrants and US border officers, including 165,000 involving minors.

Long-term reforms remain elusive. Mr Biden's plan to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US has stalled in Congress, and he failed to overturn a Trump-era policy that made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard in the US.

Meanwhile, he has defended the use of a Trump policy that lets the government automatically expel undocumented asylum seekers in order to stop the spread of Covid-19. He used the so-called Title 42 policy to kick 4,000 Haitians out of Texas, drawing widespread condemnation.

Anthony Zurcher: There was always going to be an uptick in undocumented border crossings after the pandemic depressed migration levels for much of 2020. What was somewhat unexpected was that Mr Biden's immigration reforms - the ones he delivered on - super-charged the migratory crisis, swamping US border facilities unprepared for the surge. The result is that few people have been satisfied with the outcomes.

What are his accomplishments?

Despite opposition from Republicans and a fractured Democratic caucus, he managed to pass a $1tn infrastructure bill in November.

A longer term accomplishment may be his prolific appointment of judges - he has named more in his first year than any president since Ronald Reagan.

However, Mr Biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn't help him push his voting reforms through Congress. It wasn't the first time. Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, moderate Democrats in key swing states, have also held back his social-spending bill and climate agenda.

Anthony Zurcher: A lot of the focus over the past year has been on what Mr Biden hasn't accomplished in Congress versus what his administration has succeeded in pushing through. As any parent knows, making a promise you can't keep is a great way to provoke a temper tantrum. Mr Biden spread a lot of promises out on the campaign trail, some of which were unrealistic or depended on circumstances beyond his control. Now he's facing an electorate whose temper is starting to flare.","After taking office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden emphasized that his administration would prioritize the value of democracy.

In the context of a national health crisis and following the events at the Capitol, he aspired to foster cohesion and achieve significant objectives.

""We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus,"" he remarked.

A year into his term, we examine President Biden's achievements, public opinion, and the implications for his presidency ahead, with input from the BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.

How are his approval ratings?

Following a closely contested presidential election, Mr. Biden started his presidency with a public approval rating of 56%, according to RealClearPolitics, having secured a historical vote count exceeding 80 million.

His approval faced challenges during the US troops withdrawal from Afghanistan and the surge of the Delta variant.

Since then, approval figures have declined further amid difficulties in fulfilling campaign promises related to managing the pandemic and economic revitalization for families.

Looking at other recent presidents' first years, only Donald Trump experienced a sharper decline, with a drop from 45% at inauguration to 35% a year on, based on Gallup's historical data.

Biden's predecessor, Barack Obama, started with nearly a 70% approval and saw it adjust to around 50% after a year. George W Bush's approval was close to 60% at the outset, increasing to nearly 90% post-9/11.

Has he got the pandemic under control?

In his first year, Biden expanded vaccine access, with about 75% of the US receiving at least one vaccine dose and 63% fully vaccinated. Children aged 5 and up became vaccine-eligible in November, and 80 million booster shots have been administered.

Yet, new variants and vaccine hesitancy persist, with three significant waves of the virus throughout the year and over 850,000 American lives lost to Covid-19 to date.

How has the US economy fared under his watch?

Economic recovery has been a central concern. With the economy significantly impacted by the pandemic upon Biden's inauguration, job growth had been sluggish, and unemployment was problematic due to pandemic restrictions.

Employment saw an improvement over the year, with 6.4 million jobs added, and jobless claims hitting a near 50-year low, despite total employment still trailing pre-pandemic numbers. Some sectors are experiencing labor shortages, which have affected global supply chains and contributed to high inflation rates.

Has he delivered on immigration reforms?

Biden pledged to cease the separation of migrant families and detention of minors at the border. He ended the ""zero-tolerance"" practice, and detentions have significantly reduced.

However, there has been an increase in migrants arriving at the border, with around 2 million encounters in 2021, including 165,000 minors. Comprehensive reforms are still pending, with efforts to provide legal status to millions of undocumented individuals facing challenges in Congress. Biden has also maintained a health policy enabling the expulsion of undocumented asylum seekers.

What are his accomplishments?

Despite partisan opposition, Biden succeeded in passing a $1tn infrastructure bill. He has also made notable judicial appointments during his first year in office.

However, he encountered setbacks when some Democratic senators expressed their unwillingness to support his voting reforms and social spending plans. These challenges highlight the complexity of enacting policy changes even within the president's party.","This analysis will look for language and phrases that indicate any inherent political bias in the article, highlighting instances that suggest a particular viewpoint:

1. _""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy""_
   - This phrase sets a positive, uplifting tone for the beginning of Biden's presidency, suggesting a bias toward viewing his presidency as a win for democratic values.

2. _""he vowed to bring back unity and do 'great things'""_
   - The emphasis on unity and ""great things"" is implicitly approving, indicating a favorable view of Biden's goals.

3. _""His star began to fall""_
   - ""Star began to fall"" is metaphorical language suggesting decline after initial success, hinting at a narrative of unmet expectations, which could be seen as critical of Biden's performance.

4. _""widely criticised withdrawal""_
   - The term ""widely criticised"" indicates a consensus of negative opinion, suggesting that the Biden administration's actions in Afghanistan are generally viewed unfavorably. This choice of words acknowledges the political controversy without directly aligning with a specific viewpoint.

5. _""only Donald Trump has had a more disappointing first year""_
   - The comparative statement positions Trump's first year as worse than Biden's, indicating a viewpoint that is less favorable toward Trump's presidency relative to Biden's.

6. _""near universal Republican dislike""_
   - This phrasing suggests a partisanship contrast without explicitly endorsing either side. It highlights political division, potentially biasing the reader to see Biden's challenges as exacerbated by partisan dynamics.

7. _""tackling the pandemic is his top priority""_
   - Stating that Biden has a top priority paints his administration as goal-oriented and focused, which could be perceived as a positive spin on his presidency.

8. _""continued opposition to vaccines by some""_
   - This subtly implies a viewpoint that such opposition is unreasonable or a hindrance, which aligns with a perspective supportive of vaccination.

9. _""may sit next to George W Bush's Iraq War 'mission accomplished' banner""_
   - This comparison to a famously premature declaration by Bush suggests an ideological stance that counts Biden's declaration as similarly premature and thus open to criticism.

10. _""rocketing inflation""_
    - The term ""rocketing"" conveys the rapid and uncontrollable nature of inflation, emphasizing the severity of economic challenges which could reflect a negative viewpoint of the current state of the economy.

11. _""But the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over.""_
    - This statement points to ongoing issues despite Biden's focus and efforts on the pandemic, suggesting a perspective that his administration's efforts have not been entirely successful.

12. _""swamping US border facilities unprepared for the surge""_
    - The use of the word ""swamping"" conveys a sense of being overwhelmed or inadequately prepared, critical of the administration's handling of border issues.

13. _""making a promise you can't keep is a great way to provoke a temper tantrum""_
    - This colloquial analogy playfully critiques Biden's failure to fulfill some promises, indicating a viewpoint that holds him accountable for these shortcomings.

14. _""Now he's facing an electorate whose temper is starting to flare.""_
    - The article ends with a phrasing that suggests growing public dissatisfaction, possibly indicating a viewpoint that foresees difficulties for Biden because of unfulfilled commitments.

Overall, the article features a mix of language that conveys both approval of Biden's stated intentions, like prioritizing democracy and tackling the pandemic, as well as criticism for unmet goals and challenges, such as the handling of Afghanistan and the pandemic, inflation, and immigration reform. The rhetoric employed suggests a centrist or balanced viewpoint but is critical of perceived failures or unfulfilled promises, thus indicating an ideological perspective that values accountability and practical results over political orientation."
bbc,Police,"The family of Brian Sicknick, a Capitol police officer who suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after the 6 January riots, refused to shake hands with Republican leaders Mitch McConnel and Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday.

The family was in Washington DC for the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony.

The medal is the highest honour Congress can bestow, and was being given to law enforcement who defended the US Capitol during the riots.

The footage shows three family members shaking hands with Democrat Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, before passing quickly by Mr McConnel, the Senate minority leader, and Mr McCarthy, the minority House leader.

Gladys Sicknick, Brian's mother, told CNN she thought the Republican leaders were “ two-faced"" for praising the efforts of the Capitol police while supporting former President Donald Trump.","The family of Brian Sicknick, a Capitol police officer who died of natural causes the day following the 6 January events at the Capitol, did not engage in handshake greetings with Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy during the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony in Washington DC.

The ceremony was a prestigious event recognizing law enforcement personnel for their efforts in defending the Capitol.

Video from the event shows the family members shaking hands with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and then moving on without shaking hands with McConnell, the Senate minority leader, and McCarthy, the House minority leader.

Gladys Sicknick, Brian's mother, in an interview with CNN, expressed her dissatisfaction with the Republican leaders, criticizing them for their public statements following the events at the Capitol and their subsequent actions.","The provided article appears to use language and rhetoric in a relatively neutral and factual manner, leaving little room for explicit ideological bias within the specific examples given. Nonetheless, some interpretations might suggest subtle indications of a viewpoint based on the framing of certain elements. Please note that these interpretations are by nature somewhat subjective, and different analysts might come up with different conclusions based on the same text.

1. ""The family of Brian Sicknick, a Capitol police officer who suffered two strokes and died of natural causes a day after the 6 January riots, refused to shake hands with Republican leaders...""
   - The use of the term ""refused"" carries a connotation of an intentional and possibly charged action. In this context, mentioning this refusal in the opening line could subtly imply that the action of the officer's family was noteworthy and justifiable within the context of the article's subject, possibly suggesting a critical stance towards the Republican leaders' behavior or roles in relation to the incident.

2. ""...before passing quickly by Mr McConnel, the Senate minority leader, and Mr McCarthy, the minority House leader.""
   - The phrase ""passing quickly by"" is descriptive, but it might be insinuating that the family purposefully avoided a longer interaction with Republican leaders. This could suggest a certain level of tension or disapproval of these leaders by the family, and by placing this detail within the article, it highlights the family’s actions as a statement against the leaders.

3. ""Gladys Sicknick, Brian's mother, told CNN she thought the Republican leaders were 'two-faced' for praising the efforts of the Capitol police while supporting former President Donald Trump.""
   - Gladys Sicknick's direct quote referring to the Republican leaders as ""two-faced"" is a strong term that conveys hypocrisy. Including this quotation provides readers with a clear and unambiguous indication of the family's view and the perceived disconnect between the leaders' actions and their words. The position of the family is used to implicitly criticize the leaders’ stance and simultaneously suggests a skepticism about their integrity.

In summary, while the article itself may not explicitly be biased, the choice of which events and quotes to include, as well as the descriptive language surrounding the actions of the Sicknick family, can provide subtle cues about the underlying perspective. These cues might suggest a critical viewpoint of the Republican leaders mentioned. However, the article does not overtly advocate for a particular political ideology; rather, it implicitly allows the sentiments expressed by Sicknick's family to suggest a critical perspective towards certain political figures."
bbc,Police,"If carried out, Cruz's death penalty will be one of only a handful of executions actually carried out every year in the US, where over 2,000 people are on death row. The US remains the only Western nation to allow capital punishment.

How will the jury decide if the gunman should get the death penalty?

In most criminal cases in the US, a jury determines culpability, and a judge decides on the punishment. But in this case, the jury will decide how he is sentenced.

If they don't give him the death penalty, the only other possible outcome for Cruz is life in prison without the possibility of parole. As per state law, however, the judge would still be able to sentence him to life in prison, even if the jury recommends that he be put to death.

In Florida, prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases where the accused has been convicted of first-degree murder with aggravating factors, which include previous felony convictions, murders that are ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel"", creating ""a risk of death to many persons"" and ""cold, calculated"" murders that were premeditated.

During the trial - which is expected to last several months - prosecutors will seek to demonstrate the aggravating factors and premeditated nature of the shooting and its grisly outcome. This is likely to include eyewitness testimony from survivors and video taken at the crime scene, as well as a possible visit to the school.

What states have the death penalty?

So far this year, seven people have been executed by five states. The most recent execution saw a 66-year-old man put to death in Arizona for the 1984 murder of an eight-year-old girl.

DPIC's deputy director, Ngozi Ndulue, told the BBC that the US has seen ""really significant, continued erosion"" in the use and acceptance of the death penalty, largely because of concerns about innocent people being executed or that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to racial minorities.

Who is most likely to be executed?

According to statistics from DPIC published earlier this year, 41% of the people still on death row are black and 42% are white, despite the fact that black people make up about 12.4% of the US population.

Ms Ndulue said that the race of the victim is among the strongest factors in the application of the death penalty. Over 75% of the victims in murder cases that have resulted in executions have been white, statistics show.

While all the prisoners currently on death rows across the US have been convicted of murder, each US state has their own rules about capital punishment, who can get the death penalty and why.

In Texas, for example, prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases where the accused has been convicted of homicide with aggravating factors, which range from murders committed for money or during an attempted kidnapping to the murders of police officers, firefighters or prison guards.

Six other states - including Texas and Oklahoma - also have laws on the books that allow for the death penalty to be sought in cases in which a minor was raped. To date, however, no death sentences have been handed down or carried out for this crime.

Lethal injections have been, and remain, the most common form of executions in the US, and were used in most executions that have taken place since 1976. In most states, it remains the only method available.

Some states, however, use other methods. In Arkansas and Florida, for example, inmates can be electrocuted if they submit a request in writing. Other states, such as Utah and Oklahoma, authorise firing squad deaths as methods of execution in cases where lethal injections are not available, or if sentenced before a certain date.

Later this year, South Carolina plans to execute convicted murderer Richard Moore by firing squad, which would mark the first time the method would be used anywhere in the US since 2010. In another case, the Supreme Court ruled in June that a Georgia inmate can die by firing squad after he argued that his veins were ""severely compromised"" and that he would suffer if given a lethal injection.

While state authorities have argued that lethal injections cause less pain and suffering than other methods, critics have argued that it possibly constitutes ""cruel and unusual"" punishment that would be contrary to the Eighth Amendment of the US constitution. The debate has seen intense legal wrangling and in 2015 reached the US Supreme Court, which ruled that condemned prisoners can only challenge the method with which they'd be executed if a viable alternative is provided.

Mr Garland, however, has come under pressure to make the death penalty available in the case of Payton Gendron, a suspected white supremacist charged with murdering 10 people in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May.

In March, the US Supreme Court re-imposed the death sentence for convicted Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, reversing an earlier appeals court ruling that voided it, arguing the judge in his original trial had failed to question potential jurors about how much they'd been following the case in the news.

Earlier in the year, then-White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration has ""grave concerns"" about whether the death penalty ""is consistent with the values that are fundamental to our sense of justice and fairness"".

The justice department, however, has defended the death sentence in Tsarnaev. Mr Garland's moratorium did not prevent prosecutors from continuing to seek capital punishment in the case.","Cruz's potential execution is among the few that proceed in the US annually, with a significant number of individuals awaiting on death row. The country continues to practice capital punishment.

The process of deciding whether Cruz will receive the death penalty involves a jury determining the sentence, a procedure that differs from the standard practice where a judge typically issues the sentencing.

Should the jury opt against the death penalty, Cruz faces life imprisonment without parole. Still, the presiding judge retains the authority to sentence him to life even if the jury proposes capital punishment.

Under Florida law, the death penalty is considered for first-degree murder convictions with identified aggravating factors. These include patterns of felony convictions, murders that entail substantial risk to multiple individuals, or murders considered planned and premeditated.

The trial is set to unfold over several months, with prosecutors presenting evidence of the premeditation and the gravity of the crime through various means including eyewitness accounts and crime scene videos. A visit to the site of the incident may be part of the proceedings.

Seven executions have taken place across five states in the current year, with the latest involving a man in Arizona for a murder dating back to 1984.

The application and public opinion regarding the death penalty have seen changes, with discussions around the risk of executing innocent individuals and uneven application across different demographics.

Statistics from earlier this year indicate a racial composition on death row, with significant representation of black individuals compared to their national population percentage.

The factors influencing death penalty sentences include the race of the victim, with over three-quarters of the cases involving white victims, based on execution data.

Regulations around capital punishment vary state by state, defining eligibility and criteria for seeking the death penalty. Texas, for example, includes aggravating factors like homicides committed for financial gain or against law enforcement and emergency personnel.

Some states authorize the death penalty in certain non-homicide crimes involving minors, though no executions for such crimes have taken place.

The primary method for executions in the US has primarily been lethal injection, with alternative methods available in specific states upon request, such as electrocution or firing squad in certain circumstances.

Discussions continue on the pain and suffering associated with execution methods and their alignment with constitutional principles, with legal challenges reaching the Supreme Court.

The moratorium set by the US Attorney General does not preclude prosecutors from pursuing the death penalty in some cases, and high-profile matters continue to navigate the federal legal system reflecting ongoing national discussions about the role and application of capital punishment.","This article appears to present information in a factual and straightforward manner. However, careful analysis of the language and rhetorical devices can reveal subtle indications of political ideology or inherent biases. Here, I will present instances that could suggest particular viewpoints:

**Instance 1:**
""*The US remains the only Western nation to allow capital punishment.*""

- Ideology: This statement might indicate an ideological stance that is critical of the death penalty, suggesting it is outdated or out of step with other Western nations.

**Instance 2:**
""*... murders that are 'especially heinous, atrocious or cruel'...*""

- Ideology: The use of evocative language such as ""heinous, atrocious or cruel"" could be interpreted as amplifying the severity of the crime and may suggest a viewpoint that supports the gravity of considering the death penalty in certain cases.

**Instance 3:**
""*... the US has seen 'really significant, continued erosion' in the use and acceptance of the death penalty, largely because of concerns about innocent people being executed or that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to racial minorities.*""

- Ideology: This statement reflects concerns often raised by anti-death penalty advocates and indicates an underlying ideology against the death penalty due to social justice issues.

**Instance 4:**
""*... black people make up about 12.4% of the US population.*""

- Ideology: The mention of the disproportionate percentage of black individuals on death row compared to their percentage in the overall population is often an argument used by those highlighting systemic racism and inequalities, aligning with a progressive or liberal viewpoint.

**Instance 5:**
""*... if sentenced before a certain date.*""

- Ideology: While this might seem like a neutral detail about different states' laws, referring to people being subject to older, potentially harsher laws can implicitly criticize the rigidity and potential unfairness of certain legal systems.

**Instance 6:**
""*... critics have argued that it possibly constitutes 'cruel and unusual' punishment...*""

- Ideology: This is language used by those opposed to the death penalty, implicating a civil rights perspective that may consider the death penalty a violation of human rights.

**Instance 7:**
""*... the Biden administration has 'grave concerns' about whether the death penalty 'is consistent with the values that are fundamental to our sense of justice and fairness'.*""

- Ideology: Paraphrasing the Biden administration's position, this sentence suggests a more liberal or progressive ideology that questions the morality and justice of the death penalty system.

To summarize, while the article doesn't overtly take sides, these instances include specific language and descriptions that can hint at an underlying political ideology or bias, leaning towards perspectives that question or criticize the use of the death penalty."
breitbart,Abortion,"A massive PR firm that represents high-profile corporations like Coca-Cola, AT&T, and Starbucks is privately advising its clients to remain silent on abortion rights, according to an internal email obtained by Popular Information.

With its top corporate clients – including Kia Motors, Astra Zeneca, and Pizza Hut, Zeno Group, a subsidiary of the world’s largest public relations conglomerate, Edelman Holdings, earns almost $120 million in annual revenue.

Zeno Group’s Executive Vice President for Media Strategy, Katie Cwayna, sent company staff “a template email to share with client contacts” with instructions on reacting to reports that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision.

According to the email, Zeno warned its clients that “the media” and others “will look for corporations to take a stand and make their views known.”

Zeno suggests its corporate clients remain silent on the issue because taking a public stance could be a “no-win” situation for companies.

Do not take a stance you cannot reverse, especially when the decision is not final. This topic is a textbook “50/50” issue. Subjects that divide the country can sometimes be no-win situations for companies because regardless of what they do they will alienate at least 15 to 30 percent of their stakeholders… Do not assume that all of your employees, customers or investors share your view.

Although the email paints abortion rights as a “50/50” issue, a recent poll found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be either “mostly” or “always” illegal, and support banning abortion completely after 15 weeks.

Zeno continued to warn its clients to stay away from the media entirely. “Avoid media’ fishing.’ Often during controversy, media will make general inquiries to multiple peer organizations, in which the first one to “raise its hand” becomes the lead,” the email template continued. Zeno told its clients that being at the center of the abortion issue is “not advisable,” and to “be judicious” with managing press inquiries.

The email template also provided its clients with advice on talking to reporters, which is to avoid them.

“Steer clear of breaking news networks/outlets,” the email said. “We anticipate the story will dominate newsfeeds for the rest of the week as more details unfold, so avoid pitching reporters and outlets that focus on breaking news.”

Along with media silence on the issue, companies are being told to remain silent on their social media accounts as well.

“Do not engage with direct questions about your company’s position,” the email added. “Whether in direct messages or public-facing posts, do not respond to questions about where your company stands on this issue.”

Zeno Group also consults top brands such as ASICS, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Phillips Health, Corona, Prudential, and Leveno.

Zeno’s message to its corporate clients telling them to avoid the abortion debate can be summed up by the following mantra: “go woke, go broke.”

Zeno Group also consults Netflix, which is dealing with its own fallout after the company made a dedicated shift towards “wokeness.”

In the last half-year, Netflix’s stock price has fallen from $671 to $215, and subscribers are also leaving the platform en masse. As a result, Netflix now performs the worst out of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500.

The PR firm’s advice to stay silent on this hot button issue also comes after the highly contested feud between Disney and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over the state’s recently enacted Parental Rights in Education Law.

However, Zeno Group CEO Barby Siegel told Popular Information the company believes in “a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare,” after the report on the internal email was published.

“At Zeno, we believe in equal access to healthcare for all, and a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare,” Siegel said. “At the same time, we live in a world with different opinions and different views, and we respect those differences.”

Siegel also added that the email template “does not accurately reflect Zeno’s position or the range of counsel that we are providing to clients.” Siegel claimed the advice was provided within the first 24 hours after Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion was leaked and intended to ” counsel clients to be measured in their immediate response to a complex developing story.”","An internal email from Zeno Group, a public relations firm associated with prominent clients such as Coca-Cola, AT&T, and Starbucks, has been made public. This email included guidance for these companies on how to navigate discussions surrounding potential changes to abortion law by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Zeno Group, an Edelman Holdings subsidiary that boasts large clients including Kia Motors, Astra Zeneca, and Pizza Hut, generates substantial annual revenue. The firm's Executive Vice President for Media Strategy, Katie Cwayna, distributed a template email advising client contacts on how to handle media inquiries concerning the U.S. Supreme Court's contemplation to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established federal legal precedents for abortion rights.

The email indicated that companies are often scrutinized by media and other entities to make their positions known on contentious issues. Zeno's advice was that public engagement on this topic could be challenging for companies, as it could alienate a significant portion of their audience. The email advised companies to consider all their stakeholders since not all might share the same viewpoint on this issue.

According to the email, firms should use caution when dealing with the media, specifically suggesting that when controversies arise, proactive engagement might not be beneficial, and advised them to manage media inquiries carefully.

Zeno Group, which also serves clients such as ASICS, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Phillips Health, Corona, Prudential, and Leveno, provided additional guidelines on maintaining a particular level of distance from ongoing media coverage for their clients, particularly avoiding debates and direct questions on social media about their position on abortion rights.

In the context of the entertainment industry, Zeno Group also works with Netflix, which has faced challenges following changes in its content strategy. Over recent months, Netflix's stock value and subscriber numbers have experienced significant shifts. 

The discussion of the firm's advisory role comes in the backdrop of other public controversies including a dispute involving Disney and legislation in Florida, drawing attention to how companies engage with social and political debates.

Following the release of the internal email, Zeno Group CEO Barby Siegel emphasized the company's support for equitable healthcare access, including a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions. Siegel also mentioned that the firm values a diversity of opinions and approaches and that the guidance provided in the leaked email was part of the firm's initial reaction to a complex and evolving issue, aiming at advising clients to respond thoughtfully.","This article contains various phrases and language choices that suggest underlying political ideologies. Here are several instances:

1. ""massive PR firm that represents high-profile corporations""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: This phrase implies a critical perspective on the size and power of corporate entities and the public relations firms that represent them, which can be indicative of an anti-corporate or leftist viewpoint.

2. ""privately advising its clients to remain silent on abortion rights""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: Highlighting private advice on a politically sensitive issue like abortion suggests a transparency or pro-choice angle, framing the firm's advice as potentially unethical or evasive of social responsibility, typically associated with a progressive stance.

3. ""no-win situation for companies""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: The use of ""no-win"" implies a pragmatic or centrist view that sees taking a stand on political issues as potentially damaging to a corporation's interests, aligning with a business-centric ideology that prioritizes neutrality to maintain market stability.

4. ""a recent poll found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be either 'mostly' or 'always' illegal""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: Citing a poll that emphasizes opposition to abortion can suggest an attempt to underline support for a more conservative or pro-life perspective, although, in this context, it may simply be reporting on public opinion to contextualize the PR firm's advice.

5. ""‘go woke, go broke.’""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: This phrase is a clear indication of a conservative viewpoint that is critical of companies adopting progressive stances on social issues, suggesting that it leads to negative fiscal consequences.

6. ""Netflix...made a dedicated shift towards 'wokeness.'""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: Using the term ""wokeness"" pejoratively implies a criticism of progressive politics, which is associated with a conservative or at least non-progressive viewpoint.

7. ""subscribers are also leaving the platform en masse""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: The assertion that subscribers are leaving ""en masse"" due to a shift towards ""wokeness"" underlines a narrative common in conservative circles that mainstream audiences reject progressive shifts in corporate behavior.

8. ""highly contested feud between Disney and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: Mentioning the political affiliation of Florida's governor (Republican) and the contentious nature of the dispute positions the issue within a partisan framework, highlighting conservative versus progressive corporate actions.

9. ""Zeno Group CEO... believes in 'a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare.'""
   - **Ideology Suggestion**: This affirmation of women's rights to healthcare decisions, including abortion, reflects a pro-choice, feminist, or progressive ideology.

10. ""we live in a world with different opinions and different views, and we respect those differences.""
    - **Ideology Suggestion**: Emphasizing the respect for diverse opinions suggests a pluralistic or moderate view that could be interpreted as either a centrist call for tolerance or a refusal to take a strong stance suggestive of corporate diplomacy.

Each of these instances reveals specific language choices that frame the narrative within particular ideological leanings. The language used in the article suggests an overall progressive criticism of corporate behavior regarding social issues, with specific references to conservative criticisms of corporate ""wokeness."""
breitbart,Abortion,"More Americans favor the idea of a 15-week abortion ban than oppose it, according to a new poll from the Wall Street Journal.

Nearly half — 48 percent — of 1,500 registered voters polled said they would “strongly or somewhat favor such restrictions, with exemptions to protect the health of the mother.” Forty-three percent of voters oppose the idea of a 15-week abortion ban. The results come as the Supreme Court considers whether to allow Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks gestation to stand.

“A total of 31 percent of voters said they strongly support a 15-week ban, while 17 percent were somewhat in support. Another 34 percent said they strongly opposed such a ban, and 10 percent said they were somewhat opposed,” according to the Journal.

However, 55 percent of voters reportedly say they want “abortion to be legal in all or most cases.” Thirty percent say abortion should be illegal except for cases that involve rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger. Eleven percent say abortion “should be illegal in all circumstances.”

“There are going to be hardened people on both ends,” Republican pollster Tony Fabrizi said. Fabrizi’s firm conducted the poll with Democrat pollster John Anzalone. “But most people are somewhere in between and a lot of people pick and choose.”

Unsurprisingly, 69 percent of Democrats polled say they are opposed to a 15-week abortion ban, while 21 percent say they support the ban. In contrast, 75 percent of Republicans support the ban and 20 percent oppose it.

The poll results are similar to other surveys taken in regards to how voters feel about limits on abortion. A Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll released on the eve of the 2022 March for Life revealed that 71 percent of Americans support legal limits on abortion. According to the poll’s results, 49 percent of Democrats support limits on abortion, while 93 percent of Republicans and 70 percent of independents support the same.

Another poll released by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) in June 2021, after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the Mississippi case, found that 53 percent of likely voters say they are more likely to vote for a Republican candidate who supports a 15-week limit on abortion compared to 28 percent who would rather vote for a Democrat who backs unlimited abortion up until the time of birth.

The Wall Street Journal poll was conducted with 1,500 registered voters between March 2-7. The margin of error for the question about whether voters wanted abortion to be legal or illegal was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and 3.6 percentage points for the question about the 15-week ban.

The case is Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392 in the Supreme Court of the United States.","A recent poll from the Wall Street Journal shows that opinions on a 15-week abortion ban are divided among Americans. In a survey of 1,500 registered voters, 48 percent expressed support for such restrictions with health exemptions for the mother, while 43 percent opposed the idea. These findings emerge as the Supreme Court reviews a Mississippi law that could set a precedent for abortion law.

Of those polled, 31 percent indicated strong support for the ban, and 17 percent were somewhat supportive. Conversely, 34 percent were strongly against the ban, and 10 percent were somewhat opposed. The poll also found that a slight majority, 55 percent, prefer that abortion be legal in most cases. On the other hand, 30 percent voiced that it should be illegal with exceptions for rape, incest, or threats to the mother's life, and 11 percent believe it should be illegal under all circumstances.

When looking at the breakdown across political lines, there is a notable difference in perspectives. A majority of Democrats (69 percent) oppose the 15-week abortion ban, compared to 21 percent who are favorable towards it. In contrast, a larger portion of Republicans (75 percent) are in favor of the ban, with 20 percent against it.

This poll's results align with other surveys that suggest many Americans are in support of having some legal limits on abortion. A Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll leading up to the 2022 March for Life showed that a significant portion of Americans, including those identifying as Democrats, Republicans, and independents, are in favor of imposing restrictions.

An SBA List poll conducted in June 2021 found that a majority of likely voters would be more inclined to support a Republican candidate who endorses a 15-week limit on abortion, over a Democratic candidate who supports broader abortion rights.

The Wall Street Journal poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for questions about the legality of abortion and 3.6 percentage points for those regarding the 15-week abortion ban. The Supreme Court case under consideration is Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.","The language used in the article appears to attempt to present facts and poll figures with minimal editorializing. However, there are subtle choices in language that might hint at certain points of view:

1. Brief quote or description: ""More Americans favor the idea of a 15-week abortion ban than oppose it""
   - The wording suggests alignment with a conservative viewpoint by beginning with the majority support for a controversial policy stance (a 15-week abortion ban).

2. Brief quote or description: ""The results come as the Supreme Court considers whether to allow Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks gestation to stand.""
   - The context of this statement is informational, but by highlighting the consideration of the Supreme Court, it places emphasis on a legal challenge that is commonly supported by conservative ideologies.

3. Brief quote or description: ""However, 55 percent of voters reportedly say they want 'abortion to be legal in all or most cases.'""
   - This statement elucidates a conflicting viewpoint—55 percent supporting legal abortion could reflect a progressive stance—which contrasts with the opening statement. The use of ""however"" serves to contrast this majority with the initial statement on the 15-week ban.

4. Brief quote or description: ""Unsurprisingly, 69 percent of Democrats... 
   - The term ""unsurprisingly"" might imply that the writer believes the Democratic position on this issue is predictable, reflecting common perceptions (or stereotypes) of Democratic views on abortion.

5. Brief quote or description: ""...who supports a 15-week limit on abortion compared to 28 percent who would rather vote for a Democrat who backs unlimited abortion up until the time of birth.""
   - The phrase ""who backs unlimited abortion up until the time of birth"" is a charged statement, often used by opponents of abortion to characterize the views of those who support abortion rights in a negative light. This phraseology is more common in conservative rhetoric, and it may speak to an underlying bias against more liberal abortion laws.

6. Brief quote or description: ""The Wall Street Journal poll was conducted...""
   - The specific mention of The Wall Street Journal, a publication that is often seen as center-right, might suggest a trust or validation of perspectives more anchored in conservative thought.

7. Brief quote or description: ""The case is Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, No. 19-1392 in the Supreme Court of the United States.""
   - While this statement is factual, the decision to conclude the article with the naming of the case before the Supreme Court places the legal process at the forefront, which could imply an endorsement of the judicial system's role in determining the outcome of highly political issues, aligning with a conservative respect for the established legal framework.

In conclusion, while the article includes multiple data points and generally sticks to reporting, the selective presentation of those points could suggest a mild conservative lean, especially by emphasizing poll results that favor restrictions on abortion and employing phrasing more typical of conservative rhetoric in discussions of abortion policy."
breitbart,COVID,"Randi Weingarten, the president of America’s largest teachers’ union, told CNN that keeping children masked in school is “absolutely the right way.”

Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom Thursday, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) leader applauded New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s (D) decision to maintain masking for children in schools until at least March while lifting virtually all other mask mandates in the state.

“I think I’m just going to lift up the one governor who I think is doing it absolutely the right way,” Weingarten said.

Hochul lifted New York’s mask mandates for businesses and most indoor public settings but excluded places where groups gather like public transit. She also excluded schools, despite the fact that children are at the lowest risk for negative effects of the coronavirus.

The Empire State’s governor has also advocated for children to get the vaccine and is not happy with the number of children in her state who have yet to get the shot. As such, she announced school districts will distribute testing kits and, given the results, make a determination on masks in schools.

New York parent and founder of “Keep NYC Schools Open” Daniella Jampel, a Democrat, said, “Starting today, maskless NYers can go to grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, and just about anywhere else. Our kids, however, will spend 7 hours behind a mask, struggling to hear their friends and understand their teacher.”

Weingarten, who claims to care about the wellbeing of children, has used her organization as a driving force behind keeping schools closed and children masked, despite the ample and growing evidence that both have been absolutely detrimental for the social and educational development of children as well as their mental health. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation have all skyrocketed among children, as well as learning loss and underdeveloped speaking, reading, and writing capabilities.

In November 2020, AFT affiliated United Federation of Teachers pushed heavily for the shut down of New York City’s entire public school system.

Meanwhile, Weingarten also recently came under fire for saying on MSNBC that masking children in school can only end when there is “no transmission in schools.”

Breccan F. Thies is a reporter for Breitbart News. You can follow him on Twitter @BreccanFThies.","Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, spoke with CNN about the decision to keep masks for children in schools.

In the interview on CNN’s Newsroom, Weingarten discussed New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's choice to continue with mask requirements for schools into March, even as the state lifts other mask mandates.

Weingarten commented on the approach taken by Gov. Hochul, who chose to keep the mask protocols in place for schools while rescinding them in businesses and other indoor public areas, but with exceptions for places like public transportation. This decision was made even as data suggests children have a lower risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.

The Governor of New York has also been encouraging vaccinations for children and is looking to improve the vaccination rates among this group. In an effort to do so, Hochul has announced a plan to distribute testing kits through school districts, with decisions on mask mandates to be informed by testing outcomes.

Daniella Jampel, New York parent and founder of “Keep NYC Schools Open,” expressed her concerns by stating that while restrictions ease across the state, school children are still required to wear masks throughout the school day.

On the topic of children's wellbeing, Weingarten emphasized the role of her organization in decision-making processes related to school protocols during the pandemic, highlighting health and safety considerations. Concerns have been raised about the impact of prolonged school closures and mask mandates on students, including challenges related to mental health, social development, and academic progress.

In November 2020, the United Federation of Teachers, an affiliate of AFT, had a significant role in advocating for the temporary closure of New York City's public school system to address rising COVID-19 cases.

Furthermore, Weingarten addressed questions about the criteria for lifting mask mandates in schools during a separate appearance on MSNBC, suggesting that decisions would be based on the levels of virus transmission within the school environment.

Breccan F. Thies is the reporter covering this story.","The article provided contains language and rhetoric that suggest a particular political bias or viewpoint. Here are some examples:

1. Quote: ""Randi Weingarten, the president of America’s largest teachers’ union, told CNN that keeping children masked in school is 'absolutely the right way.'""
   Ideology: The phrase ""absolutely the right way"" can imply an endorsement of the perceived caution and concern for public health within more progressive circles. However, in the context of the article, this statement is presented with skepticism, suggesting that the author disagrees with the union president's stance.

2. Quote: ""Despite the fact that children are at the lowest risk for negative effects of the coronavirus.""
   Ideology: The phrase indicates a viewpoint that supports lifting mask mandates for children, a stance commonly associated with conservative or libertarian ideologies that prioritize individual freedoms and are critical of government mandates.

3. Quote: ""New York parent and founder of 'Keep NYC Schools Open' Daniella Jampel, a Democrat, said...""
   Ideology: By highlighting that a critic of school masking policies is a Democrat, the author may be attempting to show that opposition to these policies transcends traditional party lines, thus undermining the argument that such policies are solely supported by one political ideology.

4. Quote: ""Weingarten, who claims to care about the wellbeing of children, has used her organization as a driving force behind keeping schools closed and children masked...""
   Ideology: The phrase ""claims to care"" implies skepticism regarding Weingarten's motives or sincerity, which could indicate a conservative perspective critical of union leadership and their roles in policymaking, especially when those policies are viewed as restrictive or harmful.

5. Quote: ""Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation have all skyrocketed among children, as well as learning loss and underdeveloped speaking, reading, and writing capabilities.""
   Ideology: Presenting these negative outcomes implies that policies supported by the union and, by extension, its political allies have been damaging. This aligns with a conservative viewpoint that may stress the adverse effects of prolonged school closures and mask mandates over potential public health benefits.

6. Quote: ""Meanwhile, Weingarten also recently came under fire for saying on MSNBC that masking children in school can only end when there is 'no transmission in schools.'""
   Ideology: The use of ""came under fire"" suggests criticism and disapproval of Weingarten's stance. It reflects a viewpoint that may advocate for a return to normalcy and opposes prolonged mandates, aligning with conservative positions that prioritize reopening schools fully.

7. The final line identifying the reporter, ""Breccan F. Thies is a reporter for Breitbart News,"" is also telling.
   Ideology: Breitbart News is generally recognized as a platform with a conservative slant. Knowing that the reporter works for this outlet can indicate that the article is likely to contain conservative viewpoints and language usage that supports those opinions.

Throughout the article, the language used, and the way in which facts and opinions are presented, suggest a bias critical of the teachers' union, government mask mandates, and prolonged school closures, all of which align with a conservative political ideology that emphasizes individual liberties, minimal government intervention, and a swift return to pre-pandemic norms."
breitbart,COVID,"Republican Study Committee (RSC) member Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) proposed a bill Tuesday that would allow citizens to sue the federal government as well as state and local governments that may jeopardize one’s job with harsh coronavirus vaccine mandates, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.

Harshbarger’s bill would allow citizens who feel forced to take the coronavirus vaccines to bring civil actions for compensatory damages, including economic and non-economic damages, against the federal government and any state or local government that imposes a mandate that threatens one’s employment.

Harshbarger said in a statement that Americans should not have to choose between their jobs and their employment,

“The Biden Administration’s unconstitutional mandates forced many Americans to choose between their job or getting vaccinated. While this is wrong and never should have happened, those forced into vaccination should have full rights to pursue legal action if they are injured,” she explained. “My bill — the Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act — is a step in the right direction towards holding this administration and our government accountable.”

“The Left forced Americans into medical procedures against their will and simultaneously restricted their right to sue for injuries,” RSC Chairman Jim Banks (R-IN) said. “It’s unacceptable. If vaccine mandates are ethical, why do they require a legal carveout? The Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act will give Americans hurt by a medical decision they were forced into a real, substantive legal recourse.”

Reps. Banks, Bill Posey (R-FL), Dough LaMalfa (R-CA). Randy Weber (R-TX), Brian Babin (R-TX), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Yvette Herrell (R-NM) are the original cosponsors of the legislation.

Under current law, Americans have few legal remedies to seek compensation for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates. Those seeking compensation generally have to use the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CPIP). This program has no court, judge, or right to appeal, and decisions are made solely by a bureaucratic administrator. Compensation for lost wages and death benefits are often arbitrarily capped, with no opportunity for collecting damages for pain and suffering, and a one-year statutory limit for making a claim. There is also no compensation for attorney fees, which makes it difficult for lower-income Americans to find legal counsel.

In contrast, Harshbarger’s legislation would let any citizen sue the federal government or any state or local government in a federal district court for relief and compensatory damages whose employment was impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates. It would also allow courts to award attorney’s fees to a citizen that wins in court.

Since the release of the coronavirus vaccines, and as of February 1, 2022, not one single American has been awarded compensation through CPIP for coronavirus-vaccine injury claims.

One study found that .3 percent of participants reported an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis after partial vaccination, and .2 percent experienced a negative reaction after full vaccination. The CDC maintains that less than one percent of those who received the Pfizer vaccine experienced a serious adverse effect.

The legislation’s “Congressional Findings” declare that coronavirus vaccine mandates are “authoritarian” and lack a “scientific basis” for public health needs:

Government-imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates that threaten Americans’ jobs and livelihoods are authoritarian, unnecessary, overreaching, irrational, needlessly divisive, and lack a purported scientific basis for public health needs. The policy of the United States is to recognize, defend, and protect the inherent rights of the individual, including the right of liberty, the right to be secure in one’s person, the right of the individual to be informed about any medical procedures, treatment, or vaccination, and the right of the individual to provide or withhold consent to such procedures, treatment, or vaccination. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that while COVID-19 vaccination can lessen the severity of illness for individuals in certain higher-risk categories, it DOES NOT preclude Americans from contracting, spreading, or being hospitalized by the COVID-19 virus. The protection of individual rights to make one’s own medical decisions in consultation with his or her health care provider — without fear of coercion, forced vaccination, loss of civil liberties, or risk of adverse employment action — is especially needed at a time when it is critical for our Nation to increase trust in public health officials. Protection of these individual rights is also vital for encouraging — where and when medically appropriate — vaccination and/or other scientific measures for keeping Americans safe and healthy.

“This Act further protects Americans’ constitutional medical rights by holding federal, state, and local governments accountable for unnecessary, irrational, overreaching, and liberty-infringing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, when many other scientifically-proven, and less liberty-intrusive tools exist for mitigating the effects of and protecting against COVID-19,” the findings conclude.

Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.","Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN), a member of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), has introduced a bill that would enable citizens to sue the federal government, as well as state and local governments, if they believe their employment has been negatively impacted by coronavirus vaccine mandates.

The proposed legislation would grant those who have felt compelled to take the coronavirus vaccines the ability to file civil lawsuits for compensatory damages, which may include economic and non-economic losses, related to mandates that they argue have endangered their jobs.

Rep. Harshbarger issued a statement expressing her belief that no individual should be forced to make a choice between their job and vaccination decisions, emphasizing her view that those who have been vaccinated under duress and suffered injuries should have the right to seek legal redress. She refers to her proposal – the Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act – as a means to provide accountability.

RSC Chairman Jim Banks (R-IN) supports the bill, indicating that it aims to offer substantial legal options to those who have been harmed by mandates that they felt they had no choice but to comply with.

Other lawmakers, including Reps. Bill Posey (R-FL), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Randy Weber (R-TX), Brian Babin (R-TX), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), and Yvette Herrell (R-NM), have joined as original co-sponsors of the bill.

The article points out that current legal avenues for those seeking recompense due to mandates are limited, often involving a process through the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CPIP), which is described as lacking judicial review or a right to appeal, with determinations made by administrative officials.

In contrast, the bill aims to enable citizens to bring lawsuits directly in federal district court, with the possibility of compensation that may include lawyer's fees for successful plaintiffs.

Regarding the coronavirus vaccines, the report notes data up to February 1, 2022, where no American has been awarded compensation through CPIP for claims related to vaccine injuries. The article also cites a study about allergic reactions in a small percentage of vaccine recipients and acknowledges the CDC's report that serious adverse effects are rare.

The bill includes ""Congressional Findings"" that criticize mandates and argue for a policy stance that values individual rights, including the right to make informed decisions about medical procedures and the right to consent or refuse vaccination. The findings suggest that there are other scientifically-proven measures for mitigating and protecting against COVID-19 that do not infringe on liberties.

Breitbart News' congressional reporter Sean Moran provided the original report, with information on following his updates available through his Twitter handle @SeanMoran3.","This article from Breitbart News presents a particular political ideology that primarily aligns with conservative and libertarian values, emphasizing skepticism towards government overreach, a defense of personal liberties, and a criticism of the Biden administration's policies. Here are specific instances that reveal the underlying political ideology:

1. **""Harshbarger said in a statement that Americans should not have to choose between their jobs and their employment...""**
   - This statement emphasizes personal freedom and the right to make individual health decisions without government interference, a principle often advocated by conservatives and libertarians.

2. **""The Biden Administration’s unconstitutional mandates...""**
   - Labeling the mandates as ""unconstitutional"" suggests a viewpoint that the Biden administration has overstepped legal and constitutional boundaries, which indicates a conservative ideology critical of perceived government overreach.

3. **""The Left forced Americans into medical procedures against their will...""**
   - The use of the term ""The Left"" to describe political opponents is often employed in conservative rhetoric to criticize liberal or progressive approaches. Describing actions as ""forcing"" Americans implies an encroachment on personal freedoms.

4. **""If vaccine mandates are ethical, why do they require a legal carveout?""**
   - This rhetorical question challenges the policies directly, suggesting that legal protections for the mandates indicate an ethical problem, aligning with conservative views that are typically suspicious of government-mandated health measures.

5. **""Government-imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates that threaten Americans’ jobs and livelihoods are authoritarian, unnecessary, overreaching, irrational, needlessly divisive, and lack a purported scientific basis for public health needs.""**
   - Use of words like ""authoritarian,"" ""unnecessary,"" ""overreaching,"" and ""irrational"" imply strong opposition to government intervention, a sentiment common in conservative and libertarian ideologies. The phrase also indicates skepticism towards the scientific justification for mandates.

6. **""...the protection of individual rights to make one’s own medical decisions in consultation with his or her health care provider — without fear of coercion, forced vaccination, loss of civil liberties, or risk of adverse employment action...""**
   - Advocating for the individual's right to consult with a personal health care provider instead of following government mandates underscores a commitment to individual autonomy over public health directives, reflecting a libertarian stance.

7. **""Protection of these individual rights is also vital for encouraging — where and when medically appropriate — vaccination and/or other scientific measures for keeping Americans safe and healthy.""**
   - This statement supports the use of vaccinations when ""medically appropriate,"" rather than as a blanket mandate, aligning with conservative and libertarian views that prioritize individual choice and a limited role for government in personal health decisions.

8. **""...holding federal, state, and local governments accountable for unnecessary, irrational, overreaching, and liberty-infringing COVID-19 vaccine mandates...""**
   - The call for accountability and the characterization of the mandates as ""liberty-infringing"" are indicative of a political ideology that values personal freedoms and limited government, hallmarks of conservative and libertarian beliefs.
   
Each of these excerpts reveals a bias that criticizes government mandates, supports individual liberties, and challenges the actions of the current administration, all indicative of a right-leaning political ideology."
breitbart,Climate Change,"Former congressman and leading Republican gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday that as governor, he will use all powers available to him to stop illegal immigration, noting that many in the GOP do not have the backbone to stand against the radical left’s illegal immigration policies.

Recent polls show the Republican primary race as very much a two-man battle between himself and State Sen. Doug Mastriano. But with Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf (D) leaving office, Republicans have a clear chance to flip the governor’s mansion. Recent polls, Barletta said, are a “reflection on what we’re seeing on the ground,” as he has a “huge grassroots campaign.”

“People know who I am,” he said, noting that they can look at his record. Many remember the actions he took as the mayor of Hazleton, where he was essentially the first mayor to “stand up and fight against illegal immigration,” and he believes that is the kind of fighter they are looking for again.

“We see so many politicians making campaign promises, and they get in and become part of the problem and disappoint people,” Barletta said. “They want a fighter. They saw me on the national stage as a mayor of a small town and do something that nobody else in the country had the courage to do, and I really do believe that’s part of why we’re in front.”

As mayor, he prioritized fighting sanctuary city policies and the drugs pouring into his city.

“I didn’t talk about it. I actually did something about it,” he said, noting that he was elected in 2000 and watched as the town was “overcome by illegal immigrants.”

“Our population grew by 50 percent, but our tax revenue stayed the same,” he said, describing gangs moving in and recruiting children. Emergency times also increased as illegal aliens used emergency rooms as primary health care. Barletta, at the time, asked for help as violent crime went up.

“I couldn’t find an elected official anywhere in Pennsylvania,” he said, ultimately going to Washington, DC, and meeting with the Department of Justice in 2005. He “begged them for help” but realized “no one there was going to help, either.” Ultimately, Barletta took matters into his own hands and moved to suspend the license of “any business that knowingly hired an illegal alien because it is illegal to hire unlawful workers.” He added, “I would also suspend the license of any landlord who knowingly harbored or rented to illegal aliens.”

As a result, illegals represented by ACLU sued him, and he fought it to the Supreme Court. But many cities across the country followed what he did in Hazleton, and he battled for it in Congress as well.

“Unfortunately for us, I found out that even on our own side, people don’t like to talk about it, but they didn’t have the backbone or courage to do something about it, and look at the mess we have today,” he said, explaining that most politicians do not want to tackle issues regarding immigration because they will be called a racist or bigot. But he said as governor, he will have a lot more power to do something about the issue. Barletta added that he recently called out President Joe Biden, Gov. Tom Wolf (D), and State Attorney General Josh Shapiro over the “ghost flights” of illegals coming in the dead of the night, “dumping them all over Pennsylvania” without any knowledge.

He also noted that fentanyl deaths have hit a record high and “we know the fentanyl is coming from the southern border.” Yet Pennsylvania officials are continuing to allow Biden to dump illegal aliens in the Keystone State.

“That ends when I’m governor of Pennsylvania. I will go after anyone who aids — what I think is human trafficking here into Pennsylvania — dumping people without our knowledge into our communities,” he said. “I’ll go after the buses or anybody that helps relocate people who are illegally being brought into Pennsylvania.”

Barletta also said he will go after every sanctuary city “with every resource that [he has] in [his] power to protect the citizens of Pennsylvania.”

The former congressman also vowed to unleash energy in Pennsylvania as governor, noting that the Russian invasion of Ukraine “highlights Biden’s failure on our energy policy” — a major national security issue, he said.

“And Pennsylvania is the answer to that. We have more energy in Pennsylvania than countries around the world, in the Middle East. We can be a global leader, and we will be when I become governor,” Barletta said, vowing to drop the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

“We’re going to greenlight pipelines when I’m governor. We’re going to reform DEP [Department of Environmental Protection],” which, he said, they used as a weapon to stop natural gas companies.

“Pennsylvania is the answer to our national security issues, and when I’m governor, we’ll be a global leader again,” he promised.","Former congressman and gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta expressed his commitment to addressing illegal immigration by utilizing the full extent of gubernatorial powers. Polls indicate a competitive primary race, and with the outgoing governor, there is an opportunity for a change in leadership. Barletta, who is recognized for his initiatives on illegal immigration while serving as the mayor of Hazleton, believes his record resonates with voters seeking proactive leadership.

He recalls his time as mayor when he confronted challenges stemming from illegal immigration, including decreased tax revenue and increased crime, and his efforts to address businesses and landlords engaging with illegal immigration. This legal battle reached the Supreme Court, and his actions in Hazleton became models for other cities.

Barletta criticized current politicians for not sufficiently addressing illegal immigration, which he states contributes to issues such as fentanyl-related deaths. He believes that the state has room for improvement on this front and pledges to take action against human trafficking and to challenge sanctuary city policies.

On the topic of energy policy, Barletta emphasized the potential of Pennsylvania to become a leader in the energy sector. He criticized current strategies and vowed to increase energy production, support pipeline development, and make regulatory changes to advance these goals. Through these actions, he contends that Pennsylvania can contribute to economic growth and national security.","The article reveals various indications of a conservative political ideology, specifically aligning with right-wing and Republican viewpoints. Here are some specific phrases and descriptions revealing this bias:

1. ""...leading Republican gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday that as governor, he will use all powers available to him to stop illegal immigration...""
   - Breitbart News is widely known for its conservative bias. Mentioning Barletta's hardline stance on illegal immigration aligns with a key concern in conservative politics, emphasizing law and order and stringent immigration policies.

2. ""...noting that many in the GOP do not have the backbone to stand against the radical left’s illegal immigration policies.""
   - This phrase suggests that there is a 'radical left' with extreme policies that need to be opposed, a common framing in conservative rhetoric, with 'radical' serving as a pejorative indicator.

3. ""...he was essentially the first mayor to “stand up and fight against illegal immigration,”...”
   - Portraying Barletta as a pioneer in the fight against illegal immigration valorizes his actions in the context of conservative values that prize individual initiative and rule of law.

4. ""He 'begged them for help' but realized 'no one there was going to help, either.' Ultimately, Barletta took matters into his own hands...""
   - The narrative of self-reliance and disillusionment with federal assistance is another hallmark of conservative ideology.

5. ""But he said as governor, he will have a lot more power to do something about the issue.""
   - Vowing to use gubernatorial power to address immigration indicates a localist, states' rights approach often championed by conservative politics.

6. ""He also noted that fentanyl deaths have hit a record high and 'we know the fentanyl is coming from the southern border.'""
   - Linking drug problems in the US to the southern border without broader context plays into conservative fears about border security without addressing the complexity of drug trafficking and addiction issues.

7. ""Barletta also said he will go after every sanctuary city 'with every resource that [he has] in [his] power to protect the citizens of Pennsylvania.'""
   - Threatening action against sanctuary cities, which generally resist federal immigration enforcement, aligns with conservative opposition to such policies.

8. ""The former congressman also vowed to unleash energy in Pennsylvania... 'highlights Biden’s failure on our energy policy'""
   - Criticism of the Biden administration's energy policy and a push for energy production echo conservative calls for economic growth and energy independence rather than global warming mitigation policies.

9. ""We’re going to greenlight pipelines when I’m governor. We’re going to reform DEP [Department of Environmental Protection], which, he said, they used as a weapon to stop natural gas companies.""
   - Promoting fossil fuel infrastructure development and criticizing environmental regulations as obstacles reflects a conservative priority on energy and economic growth over environmental protection concerns.

Each of these points underscores ideology through the use of specific language that taps into conservative themes such as opposition to perceived left-wing radicalism, illegal immigration, promotion of state rights, support for energy production, and criticism of current Democratic leadership."
breitbart,Climate Change,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) on Thursday called on Congress to pass his legislation that would immediately restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands to combat rising energy prices and boost American energy independence.

“Congress must pass my bill, the SMART Energy Act, that requires President Biden to immediately restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands. We must support America’s energy independence, American energy jobs & American energy production. Especially during these times,” Daines said in a statement.

Daines’s Supporting Made in America Renewable and Traditional (SMART) Energy Act would require Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to hold four onshore oil and gas lease sales in the top seven oil and gas producing states as well as two offshore oil and gas lease sales in both the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska region. The top seven oil and gas producing states are Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Nevada. It would also support the expansion of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands.

Daines’ renewed his push for the SMART Energy Act as Americans continued to grapple with rampant inflation, and energy prices continued to rise after Russia started its assault on Ukraine. Oil topped $100 for the first time in seven years.

Last year, Biden issued a ban on all new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands. Although a federal judge blocked the ban, the Biden administration has yet to hold an oil or gas lease sale in Montana.

Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @SeanMoran3.","Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) urged Congress on Thursday to approve legislation that would restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands, a move he believes will address the current energy prices and enhance energy production in the United States.

Daines stated, “It's important for Congress to take action on my proposed bill, the SMART Energy Act, to ensure an immediate resumption of oil and gas leasing on federal lands. This step is critical for sustaining the energy sector within the country and for protecting jobs related to energy production, particularly in light of recent challenges.""

The SMART Energy Act, as proposed by Senator Daines, would mandate the Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to arrange for four onshore oil and gas lease sales in the seven leading oil and gas producing states, as well as two offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. These states include Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Nevada. The legislation aims to also encourage the development of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands.

This push for the SMART Energy Act comes at a time when Americans are dealing with high inflation rates, with energy costs continuing to climb since the onset of the conflict involving Russia and Ukraine. Recently, the price of oil surpassed $100, marking a significant milestone that hadn't been reached in several years.

Previously, a suspension on new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands was ordered, but after legal intervention, the suspension was overturned. However, there has been a notable absence of lease sales in states like Montana.

Sean Moran, who covers Congressional developments, has reported on this story.","In analyzing the use of language and rhetoric in the provided article, there are several instances that suggest a particular political ideology or bias:

1. ""...to combat rising energy prices and boost American energy independence.""
   - The emphasis on ""American energy independence"" implies support for an America-first energy policy, which is typically associated with conservative or right-leaning ideologies that prioritize national self-sufficiency over international agreements or concerns about global environmental impacts.

2. ""Congress must pass my bill...""
   - The direct call to action, ""must pass,"" indicates an urgency and assertiveness that is often found in conservative messaging. It suggests that the proposed action is not only preferred but necessary for the country's wellbeing.

3. ""We must support America’s energy independence, American energy jobs & American energy production.""
   - The repeated use of ""American"" before key concepts such as independence, jobs, and production promotes a nationalist tone. This language resonates with ideologies that prioritize domestic production and employment over global trade and cooperation.

4. ""Daines’s Supporting Made in America Renewable and Traditional (SMART) Energy Act...""
   - The name ""Supporting Made in America"" within the bill's acronym connotes a strong nationalist approach, fitting within a conservative or right-leaning ideology that champions domestic industry.

5. ""...renewed his push for the SMART Energy Act as Americans continued to grapple with rampant inflation...""
   - Describing inflation as ""rampant"" suggests a critical view of the current economic climate, often found in oppositional or conservative rhetoric, particularly directed against the policies of an administration from a different party (in this case, the Biden administration).

6. ""Last year, Biden issued a ban on all new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands.""
   - This statement positions the Biden administration as antagonistic to the fossil fuel industry, a perspective that is commonly shared by conservative media and political figures who advocate for fewer restrictions on energy production.

7. ""Although a federal judge blocked the ban, the Biden administration has yet to hold an oil or gas lease sale in Montana.""
   - By highlighting that the administration ""has yet to hold"" a lease sale despite the judge's action, the article implies a failure or reluctance on the part of the Biden administration to support the energy industry, aligning with a conservative viewpoint that is pro-fossil fuel development.

8. ""Sean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.""
   - Breitbart News is known for its conservative and right-leaning editorial stance. The simple association of the article with Breitbart News implies that the content could exhibit a conservative bias.

The language and rhetoric present in the article collectively suggest that the underlying political ideology leans towards conservative principles, with an emphasis on national energy independence, economic nationalism, and a pro-fossil fuel industry stance."
breitbart,Economy,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) doubled down on Friday, warning that the state will not “subsidize” Disney’s “corporate speech” and vowed that the woke company “is not going to have its own government in Florida.”

Speaking at a press conference, where he announced the biggest tax relief package in the state’s history, DeSantis pointed to other wins the state has racked up, including “leading the effort in the country to make sure that our school system is for education, not for indoctrination.”

“That involves things like making sure every parent in Florida has the right to access the curriculum that’s being used in their kid’s school,” he said, explaining that the far-left has fought against his administration on that issue:

We want to make sure that we’re focusing on teaching kids to get the right answer and not being diverted by ideologies and other type of stuff that really isn’t pertinent in any of this. And then obviously we believe, you know, parents have the right to send their kids to like kindergarten without having a lot of this sexual content injected into the curriculum. And, you know, I think parents overwhelmingly agree with that.

“There’s one company that’s headquartered in Burbank, California that didn’t agree with that,” he said, referencing his administration’s war with Disney and making it clear that “we run this state, they do not run this state.”

“We’re going to do what’s right for parents,” he said, adding that it is “not the responsibility of Florida citizens to subsidize your corporate speech.”

As a result, the legislature took action to dissolve Disney’s special taxing district, sparking outcry from leftists.

“At the end of the day, Disney is not going to have its own government in Florida,” he vowed. “Disney is going to have to live under the same laws that everybody else lives under in Florida.”

“Disney will pay its fair share of taxes, and Disney is going to be responsible for all the debt it has racked up. That will happen. Anyone that tells you differently is not being honest about it,” he said, adding that they will outline the proposals in the “coming weeks and months.”

Disney has continued to pay the price, literally, for making it clear that it does not respect parental rights, as Walt Disney Co. lost nearly $63 billion in market capitalization since coming out against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, which protects children in kindergarten through third grade from classroom discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced on Friday that the state of Florida intends to hold all entities to the same standard, stating that no company, including Disney, will be granted self-governing power within the state.

During a press conference where he unveiled what he described as the largest tax relief in Florida's history, DeSantis articulated plans for education reform. Addressing academic approaches, he emphasized transparency in school curricula and the importance of focusing educational content on academic proficiency rather than extracurricular ideologies. This, he stated, aligns with the interests of many parents.

DeSantis referred to a disagreement with Disney over recent policy developments, affirming that state governance supersedes corporate influence. He assured Floridians that the actions taken by the state legislature, which aim to repeal Disney's special taxing privileges, were in line with the administration's commitment to equal treatment under the law and fiscal responsibility.

The governor assured that the prospective changes to Disney's status would not exempt the company from its tax obligations or its financial liabilities. Specifics regarding these proposals are expected to be detailed in future discussions.

Amidst ongoing debate, Disney's stance on Florida’s new educational bill has had financial repercussions, as evidenced by a noticeable decrease in its market value. The state's Parental Rights in Education bill has received mixed responses, with proponents arguing for its protection of child-focused education and opponents raising concerns about restrictions on classroom conversations.","To analyze the use of language and rhetoric in the provided article, we'll look for terms, phrases, and points of emphasis that indicate a certain political ideology or bias. Here are several examples:

1. ""Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) doubled down on Friday, warning that the state will not 'subsidize' Disney’s 'corporate speech'...""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The phrase ""doubled down"" suggests a firm and unyielding stance, often admired in conservative politics as strength and conviction. The term ""corporate speech"" carries a critical tone that resonates with the populist sentiment of standing against large corporations influencing societal issues, a view often affiliated with the conservative side of politics.

2. ""...vowed that the woke company 'is not going to have its own government in Florida.'""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The use of ""woke"" pejoratively indicates a conservative viewpoint that opposes progressive or left-leaning ideologies, particularly those associated with social justice movements. Labeling a company as ""woke"" suggests that the company is excessively politically correct or aligned with liberal ideals.

3. ""...including 'leading the effort in the country to make sure that our school system is for education, not for indoctrination.'""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The contrast between ""education"" and ""indoctrination"" indicates a belief that the education system should not impose certain ideologies, a concern often voiced within conservative circles. This plays into a broader narrative about educational reform and the role of personal values and parental control in education.

4. ""The far-left has fought against his administration on that issue...""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The term ""far-left"" is often used by conservatives to describe their opposition, suggesting extreme or radical views that are out of touch with mainstream or traditional values.

5. ""...without having a lot of this sexual content injected into the curriculum.""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The phrase ""injected into"" implies an unnatural or forced introduction of material considered inappropriate by the speaker, aligning with conservative values that prioritize traditional family structures and age-appropriate education.

6. ""We’re going to do what’s right for parents...""
   - **Ideology Indication**: Emphasizing the rights of parents reflects a conservative view that prioritizes family authority and autonomy over governmental or institutional influence, which is a central theme in the ""parental rights"" movement.

7. ""As a result, the legislature took action to dissolve Disney’s special taxing district, sparking outcry from leftists.""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The use of ""leftists"" as opposed to a more neutral term like ""critics"" or ""opponents"" portrays those who disagree as being on the political left, framing the issue as a battle between conservative governance and leftist dissent.

8. ""Disney has continued to pay the price, literally, for making it clear that it does not respect parental rights...""
   - **Ideology Indication**: The mention of ""parental rights"" affirms a conservative agenda centered around maintaining and strengthening the family unit's control over children's upbringing and education, often in opposition to government or external entities.

Through the use of terms like ""woke,"" ""far-left,"" ""indoctrination,"" and ""parental rights,"" the article showcases a conservative ideological standpoint that frames the conflict between the DeSantis administration and Disney within the broader political debate over education, corporate influence, and family values. The rhetoric and language choices prominently feature the conservative perspective and narrative."
breitbart,Economy,"Democrats in control of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee released six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns on Friday, an unprecedented intrusion that revealed nothing in particular.

The release marked the first time Congress had ever obtained and published the tax returns of any individual.

Trump had resisted calls to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election, saying that they were under audit. He was also reluctant to give political ammunition to his rivals. (In 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) claimed that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had not paid taxes for years, a claim that was given credibility by the media but had no basis in fact.)

Democrats speculated that Trump must have been hiding something, and fantasized about what his returns might show. But when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow published a 2005 tax return showing he paid $38 million in income taxes, she was widely mocked.

In 2019, the New York Times claimed to have obtained “decades” of Trump’s tax returns. Though the paper reported that he shown “chronic losses and years of tax avoidance,” it could find nothing illegal or untoward.

The Times story, if based on authentic documents, appears to debunk several conspiracy theories held by Democrats for years. The tax returns do not “any previously unreported connections to Russia,” the Times reports. Moreover, the Times story appears to confirm Trump’s claim — long treated as an excuse by Democrats — that he is under audit by the IRS. And the Times could not find “any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen,” ostensibly the subject of the New York investigation [into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels].

Nevertheless, Democrats tried to use their majority on the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, to force Trump to release his returns, though there was no real legislative purpose in doing so.

Trump resisted the committee’s efforts in the courts, until finally losing at the Supreme Court, which allowed the Committee to compel the IRS to turn over the tax returns of Trump, now a private citizen.

The House Ways and Means Committee released the returns just days before Democrats formally lose their majority in the House of Representatives — and, with it, majority control of the various House committees.

The six years of newly-released returns, covering the years 2015 through 2020, show that Trump paid a total of $4.4 million in federal income taxes over that period, with an adjusted gross income of -$53.2 million. “The Trumps paid some form of federal taxes every year, but they reported income-tax liability of $750 or less in three of the six years,” the Wall Street Journal noted. Democrats point to some potential problems. They claim that Trump’s tax returns as president were not properly audited by the IRS (a claim the IRS disputes). They also complained about charitable deductions and whether loans to his children should have been taxed as income.

However, there appeared to be few bombshells. In a statement on Truth Social, his social media platform, the former president said the returns showed “how proudly successful I have been” and warned that “the Democrats should never have done it.”

Republicans echoed the latter sentiment, saying the release of the tax returns seemed to have a purely political motive, and opened the door for Republicans to do the same in future.

Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak.","Members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which is currently under Democratic leadership, made public six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns on Friday. This release is the first instance of Congress disclosing the tax details of an individual.

Former President Trump did not disclose his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election campaign, citing ongoing audits as the reason. This decision generated a significant amount of speculation and criticism, as is customary for presidential candidates to release their returns for public scrutiny.

In a notable instance, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow disclosed a 2005 tax return which indicated that Trump had paid $38 million in income taxes. This information added to the public discussion about Trump’s financial history.

The New York Times, in 2019, released a report based on what it described as ""decades"" of Trump’s tax information. According to the Times, the records suggested a pattern of financial losses and strategies to avoid taxes, yet nothing that contravened legal boundaries was identified.

The Ways and Means Committee acquired Trump's tax details after a lengthy legal process that culminated in the Supreme Court allowing the panel to secure the documents from the IRS.

The disclosed returns span the years 2015 to 2020 and show that Trump paid a total of $4.4 million in federal income taxes during that period, despite recording an adjusted gross income of -$53.2 million. As noted by the Wall Street Journal, the records indicate that Trump paid various amounts of federal taxes each year, including years where the reported income-tax liability was $750 or less.

Questions were raised regarding the extent and thoroughness of IRS audits on Trump’s returns during his presidency, alongside discussions about certain charitable deductions and the tax treatment of loans to his family.

The returns were released shortly before the end of the Democratic majority in the House, after which the control of House committees would also shift. 

Former President Trump commented on the matter, characterizing the release as unnecessary and emphasizing his business successes. The Republican viewpoint suggests the release had partisan motivations and cautioned against potential reciprocal actions in the future.

The author of the article, Joel B. Pollak, serves as Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News and hosts a program on Sirius XM. He has authored books on political subjects and is active on social media platforms.","The language and rhetoric employed in the article suggest a conservative or right-leaning political ideology, critical of the Democratic Party and supportive of former President Donald Trump. Here are specific examples:

1. ""an unprecedented intrusion that revealed nothing in particular.""
   - The use of the term ""intrusion"" implies an inappropriate or unwarranted invasion of privacy, suggesting that the author views the release of Trump's tax returns as an overreach by the Democratic-controlled committee.

2. ""(In 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) claimed that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had not paid taxes for years, a claim that was given credibility by the media but had no basis in fact.)""
   - This statement emphasizes a narrative of media bias, implying that the media uncritically reinforces claims by Democrats while challenging the credibility of Republican figures.

3. ""But when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow published a 2005 tax return showing he paid $38 million in income taxes, she was widely mocked.""
   - Referring to Rachel Maddow being ""widely mocked"" suggests that those who scrutinize Trump are deserving of ridicule, a perspective consistent with conservative media reactions.

4. ""Though the paper reported that he shown 'chronic losses and years of tax avoidance,' it could find nothing illegal or untoward.""
   - The phrase “chronic losses and years of tax avoidance” could allude to smart business practices from a conservative perspective, minimizing any negative connotations by noting the absence of illegality.

5. ""Nevertheless, Democrats tried to use their majority on the Ways and Means Committee... to force Trump to release his returns, though there was no real legislative purpose in doing so.""
   - The assertion that there was ""no real legislative purpose"" conveys the viewpoint that Democrats' actions were politically motivated rather than grounded in genuine concerns for oversight or governance.

6. ""The House Ways and Means Committee released the returns just days before Democrats formally lose their majority in the House of Representatives...""
   - The timing of the tax returns' release is characterized in a way that implies a last-minute, politically driven act by Democrats, consistent with a narrative of partisanship.

7. ""Republicans echoed the latter sentiment, saying the release of the tax returns seemed to have a purely political motive...""
   - This statement aligns the author with Republican views, suggesting a shared belief in the nefarious motivation behind the release of Trump's tax records.

8. ""Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News...""
   - The author's association with Breitbart News, a platform known for its conservative and right-wing content, offers additional context that supports the ideological leanings identified in the article.

The language and rhetoric reveal a bias toward viewing Democrats' actions as politically motivated and overreaching, while defending or minimizing criticisms of Donald Trump. This is demonstrated through the choice of language that emphasizes claims of privacy invasion, allegations of media bias, and questioning the legitimacy of oversight efforts. The language also portrays actions taken against Trump as unjustified and heralds conservative responses as reasonable or victimized."
breitbart,Election,"President Joe Biden exploited an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) in October 2020, blaming President Donald Trump after sensational arrests in a crucial swing state — yet the trial ended Friday without any convictions.

Two of the accused, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were acquitted. The jury deadlocked on the charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft, the supposed leaders of the plot.

The Biden campaign and the establishment media treated all of the accused as if they were Trump supporters, yet Caserta was seen online in front of an anarchist flag, and Harris had joined a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020 — both facts that were buried by the Democrat and the media in blaming Trump.

At the time the FBI announced the charges in October 2020, with the presidential campaign at a crucial point, Biden suggested that the defendants were white supremacists, and that Trump was at fault for the plot:

There is no place for hate in America. And both of us [including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) have been talking about this for some time, about how white supremacists and these militias area a genuine threat. I want to compliment the FBI and the police agencies for what they did, and how they stepped up. But look –the words of a president matter. Whether they can — you’ve heard me say this before. They can cause a nation to have th market rise or fall, go to war or bring peace, but they can also breathe oxygen into those who are filled with hate and danger, and I just think It’s got to stop. The president has to realize the words he utters matter.

There was no evidence at the time tying Trump to the plot whatsoever, nor did any such evidence emerge during the trial.

As the trial continued, questions were raised about the role of the FBI informants, suggesting that they may have entrapped the defendants, or concocted the plot themselves. As Buzzfeed News — hardly a right-wing outlet — noted last year:

An examination of the case by BuzzFeed News also reveals that some of those informants, acting under the direction of the FBI, played a far larger role than has previously been reported. Working in secret, they did more than just passively observe and report on the actions of the suspects. Instead, they had a hand in nearly every aspect of the alleged plot, starting with its inception. The extent of their involvement raises questions as to whether there would have even been a conspiracy without them.

The judge issued jury instructions on entrapment, telling jurors they could find the defendants not guilty if they believed “[t]hat the agents or informants sought to persuade or pressure the men into agreeing to such a plot; and that the defendants showed no predisposition to commit such a crime until after the FBI came into the picture,” the Associated Press noted.

The FBI had shown a consistent hostility toward Trump both before and during his administration, with key FBI figures involved in pursuing the false “Russia collusion” conspiracy theory, even lying to a court to obtain a surveillance warrant.

However, the trial concluded on Friday with no convictions secured.

Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, two of the individuals charged, were acquitted. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft, who were purportedly the leaders of the plot.

During the campaign period, the Biden campaign and some media outlets made connections between the accused individuals and Trump supporters, despite varied evidence of the accused's political affiliations. For instance, Caserta was seen in front of an anarchist flag in online content, and Harris was reported to have attended a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020.

In a statement made when the FBI announced the charges in October 2020, Biden discussed the threat of white supremacists and militias and emphasized the impact of a president's words, without direct attribution to any singular political figure or group:

There is no place for hate in America. And both of us [including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)] have been talking about this for some time, about how white supremacists and these militias are a genuine threat. I want to compliment the FBI and the police agencies for what they did, and how they stepped up. But look – the words of a president matter. They can cause a nation to have the market rise or fall, go to war or bring peace, but they can also breathe oxygen into those who are filled with hate and danger, and it just has to stop. The president has to realize the words he utters matter.

At that juncture, there was no substantiated evidence linking Trump directly to the kidnapping plot, and no such evidence was presented during the subsequent trial.

During the trial, the role of FBI informants came under scrutiny, leading to discussions on potential entrapment. Buzzfeed News conducted an investigation and suggested that the informants may have played a pivotal role in the development of the alleged plot. This involvement included contributing to its formation and actively participating in the suspected activities.

The presiding judge informed the jurors about entrapment law, explaining they could acquit the defendants if they believed the FBI informants instigated the plot and the accused showed no prior intention to commit such a crime before the FBI's involvement, as reported by the Associated Press.

Discussions on the FBI's role in the case and other events have been part of the broader public and media dialogue, which often includes diverse perspectives on law enforcement practices and the agency's impact on national politics.

Pollak was awarded the 2018 Robert Novak Journalism Alumni Fellowship.","The article employs specific language and rhetorical strategies that suggest a political ideology aligned with conservatism, particularly as represented by the right-leaning Breitbart News platform. Several quotes and contexts from the article highlight this bias:

1. ""President Joe Biden **exploited** an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer""
   - The use of the word ""exploited"" suggests that Biden inappropriately or manipulatively used the situation for his own advantage, implying a negative view of his actions.

2. ""The Biden campaign and the establishment media **treated** all of the accused as if they were Trump supporters""
   - The term ""establishment media"" is frequently used by conservative outlets to describe mainstream media perceived to have a liberal bias. This suggests the article's viewpoint is that the media and the Biden campaign were unfairly aligning the accused with Trump.

3. ""yet Caserta was seen online in front of an anarchist flag, and Harris had joined a Black Lives Matter protest""
   - This mention juxtaposes the accused's actions with movements that are typically not associated with conservative ideologies, suggesting there was a misrepresentation by those portraying them as Trump supporters.

4. ""both facts that were **buried** by the Democrat and the media in blaming Trump""
   - The verb ""buried"" implies a deliberate effort by Democrats and the media to hide or ignore information that contradicts the narrative of Trump's culpability.

5. ""There was no evidence at the time tying Trump to the plot **whatsoever**, nor did any such evidence emerge during the trial.""
   - The use of ""whatsoever"" emphasizes the lack of connection, pointing to a perceived injustice in the accusations against Trump.

6. ""As Buzzfeed News — **hardly a right-wing outlet** — noted last year""
   - This parenthetical remark is used to bolster the credibility of the information by indicating that even a non-conservative source reported on the FBI's questionable involvement, suggesting that criticisms are not confined to the right-wing perspective.

7. ""The judge issued jury instructions on **entrapment**""
   - Discussing entrapment serves two purposes: implying the FBI’s possibly unethical behavior and casting doubt on the legitimacy of the case against the accused, which are common points in conservative commentary on law enforcement overreach.

8. ""The FBI had shown a **consistent hostility** toward Trump both before and during his administration""
   - The phrasing here asserts a pattern of opposition against Trump by the FBI, a narrative that aligns with conservative beliefs about the ""deep state"" and institutional bias.

9. ""**false** 'Russia collusion' conspiracy theory""
   - Labeling the Russia collusion investigation as a ""false conspiracy theory"" aligns with the Trump and conservative view that the investigation was unfounded and politically motivated.

Each of these examples from the article showcases a use of language and presentation that is consistent with a conservative viewpoint that is supportive of Trump and critical of the Democratic Party, mainstream media, and federal institutions like the FBI. The overall tone and choice of words signal a belief in a biased or unjust treatment of the events by entities perceived to oppose conservative ideologies and actors."
breitbart,Election,"Every candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Texas’s Republican primaries have either won or are substantially leading their races as of 11:00 p.m. ET, potentially solidifying Trump’s kingmaker status in the first primaries of 2022.

The 45th president gave his stamp of approval — a much coveted prize among Republican hopefuls — to 33 candidates. Polling out of Texas has already shown that GOP voters are more likely to support candidates who have passed Trump’s muster.

The former president released a statement celebrating his late night victory:

Big night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff. Governor Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick have won in a landslide. Thank you, and congratulations to all!

Trump’s endorsement secured the nomination of incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who faced fierce primary opposition from former State Sen. Don Huffines and former State Party Chairman Allen West. He also lifted two of House Republicans’ top recruits to the nomination without a runoff: Monica De La Cruz and Wesley Hunt, who are both at 56 percent with well over half the votes counted.

The Texas primaries are the first regularly scheduled primary elections in the 2022 cycle, making it the first opportunity to test the power of Trump’s endorsement post-presidency. As Breitbart News previously reported, how Trump fares on these races could influence how aggressive he gets in future primaries elsewhere in America.

“After incredible success with President Trump’s endorsements up and down the ballot last year, all 33 of President Trump’s endorsed candidates came in first tonight – an unprecedented start to the 2022 midterms,” President Trump’s former White House Political Director Brian Jack told Breitbart News.","All candidates endorsed by former President Donald Trump in the Texas Republican primaries are currently ahead or have won their races, based on results as of 11:00 p.m. ET. This development may affirm the influence of Trump's endorsement among GOP candidates.

Of the 33 candidates Trump endorsed, polling in Texas indicated that Republican voters showed a preference for those receiving his backing.

The former president expressed his satisfaction with the outcomes in Texas in a released statement:

Big night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff. Governor Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick have won in a landslide. Thank you, and congratulations to all!

Governor Greg Abbott (R) won the primary nomination, overcoming challenges from former State Sen. Don Huffines and former State Party Chairman Allen West, with Trump's endorsement believed to have played a role. Monica De La Cruz and Wesley Hunt, two candidates for the House of Representatives, also secured their nominations, each garnering around 56 percent of the vote with over half the votes counted.

The Texas primaries represent the beginning of the regularly scheduled primary elections for the 2022 cycle and serve as an initial measure of Trump's endorsement impact after his presidency. Prior reports have suggested that the outcomes of these races may impact Trump's involvement in future primary elections nationwide.

Brian Jack, former White House Political Director for President Trump, shared with the media the successful results of the endorsements stating, “After incredible success with President Trump’s endorsements up and down the ballot last year, all 33 of President Trump’s endorsed candidates came in first tonight – an unprecedented start to the 2022 midterms.”","In analyzing the use of language and rhetoric in the provided article, several instances can be pointed out that suggest a particular political bias or viewpoint. Here are specific examples:

1. ""potentially solidifying Trump’s kingmaker status""
- This phrase suggests that the article views Trump's influence in a positive light, using the term ""kingmaker"" which connotes someone with substantial power in determining political outcomes. It indicates a bias toward viewing Trump's role within the GOP as prestigious and impactful.

2. ""a much-coveted prize among Republican hopefuls""
- Referring to Trump's endorsement as a ""much-coveted prize"" implies that it is highly desirable within Republican circles. This language conveys the author's view that Trump's support is a significant advantage for candidates, reflecting a positive take on his influence.

3. “Big night in Texas!""
- This direct quote from Trump is used to highlight the perceived success of the endorsed candidates. By leading with this enthusiastic declaration, the article endorses this positive spin on the election results.

4. ""Trump’s endorsement secured the nomination...""
- The use of ""secured"" here suggests that it was Trump's endorsement that was decisive in the candidates' victories. It ascribes a large measure of credit to Trump, indicating a view that aligns with the ideology that Trump's backing is critical to electoral success within the GOP.

5. ""...faced fierce primary opposition...""
- The wording here sets up a narrative of triumph over significant adversity; it dramatizes the electoral contest and emphasizes the strength of Trump's endorsement in overcoming such ""fierce"" opposition.

6. ""...lifted two of House Republicans’ top recruits to the nomination without a runoff""
- ""Lifted"" implies Trump's endorsement elevated the candidates' chances significantly, painting a picture of his endorsement's powerful effect. The phrase ""without a runoff"" underscores the idea that Trump's support helped them avoid additional electoral challenges.

7. ""...making it the first opportunity to test the power of Trump’s endorsement post-presidency.""
- This statement places emphasis on Trump's continued relevance and influence even after his presidency. The phrase ""test the power"" suggests that Trump's endorsement is seen as a force to be reckoned with, aligning with ideologies that support Trump's leadership role in the party.

8. ""...an unprecedented start to the 2022 midterms""
- The word ""unprecedented"" is often used to signify something extraordinary or noteworthy. It implies a historic level of achievement associated with Trump's endorsements which feeds into the narrative of Trump as an exceptionally influential political figure.

Overall, the language and rhetoric within the article suggest a positive viewpoint toward former President Donald Trump's influence in the Republican Party. The words and phrases used tend to underscore his perceived power and success as a ""kingmaker,"" indicating an underlying ideological bias in favor of Trump's political sway within GOP primaries."
breitbart,Immigration,"High gas prices in the United States and now the banning of Russian oil imports following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are causing Americans to favor domestic energy production, including a poll that shows 71 percent “favor very much” or “favor somewhat” restarting the Keystone XL Pipeline.

The Canadian website The Province reported on the poll:

The idea that Canadian oil and gas could help fill shortfalls in Europe and the United States has received considerable traction in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, with some re-evaluating energy projects such as Keystone XL and Energy East. While 64 per cent of American believe Canada should fill the void left following the ban on Russian oil, the challenge for Canada would be in increasing production — it could take years, not weeks or months — and figuring out how to ship it across the border. Between 2014 and 2017, according to polling from the Pew Research Center, support for the Keystone XL pipeline dropped 17 percentage points, from 59 percent to 42 percent. It also had a major partisan divide in 2017, with 76 percent of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents supporting it, and 74 percent of Democrats opposing it. That year, then-president Donald Trump reversed former president Barack Obama’s decision to halt the pipeline. In January 2021, Biden revoked the cross-border permits the pipeline needed, and the project was officially dead by June 2021.



 Breitbart News reported on how Biden’s decision to shut down Keystone through an executive order on his first day in office cost as many as 11,000 American jobs.","Gas prices in the United States have risen, and as a response to Russia's military actions in Ukraine, Russian oil imports have been banned, leading to a heightened interest in increasing domestic energy production. A recent poll indicates that 71 percent of Americans are in favor of restarting the Keystone XL Pipeline to some degree.

The poll was covered by The Province, noting that in light of recent events, there is a renewed discussion on whether Canadian oil and gas can address energy shortages in Europe and the U.S. According to surveys, a significant portion of Americans think Canada could step in to replace Russian oil, but there are logistical and production challenges that Canada faces. Polling by the Pew Research Center indicates that support for the Keystone XL pipeline experienced a decline of 17 percentage points between 2014 and 2017. Back in 2017, President Donald Trump issued a reversal on his predecessor's decision to stop the pipeline. Later, in January 2021, President Joe Biden revoked the permits necessary for crossing the border, ending the project by June 2021.

It has been reported that the decision to halt the Keystone XL Pipeline project may have impacted employment opportunities, with estimates up to 11,000 jobs being affected.","1. ""High gas prices in the United States and now the banning of Russian oil imports following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are causing Americans to favor domestic energy production""
   - This sentence presents high gas prices and a national security concern as a rationale for favoring domestic energy production. The emphasis on ""favor domestic energy production"" can reflect a conservative or right-leaning ideology that typically supports increased domestic energy independence and production, as opposed to more liberal ideologies that might prioritize alternative energy sources or environmental concerns.

2. ""including a poll that shows 71 percent 'favor very much' or 'favor somewhat' restarting the Keystone XL Pipeline.""
   - The presentation of the poll result emphasizes a broad support for restarting the Keystone XL Pipeline. This reflects a narrative often advanced by right-leaning groups that favor traditional energy infrastructure projects, implying that there is a popular mandate to pursue such developments.

3. ""The idea that Canadian oil and gas could help fill shortfalls in Europe and the United States""
   - This phrase suggests the desirability of solving energy shortfalls with North American oil, indicative of a pro-oil industry stance, which aligns more with conservative ideologies.

4. ""with some re-evaluating energy projects such as Keystone XL and Energy East.""
   - The phrase ""some re-evaluating"" implies a reconsideration of previously dismissed or halted projects due to new circumstances. This hints at an ideological stance that favors the reactivation of such projects, often associated with a conservative or pro-fossil fuel viewpoint.

5. ""It also had a major partisan divide in 2017, with 76 percent of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents supporting it, and 74 percent of Democrats opposing it.""
   - Mentioning the partisan divide contextualizes the Keystone XL Pipeline as a politically polarizing issue. It indirectly suggests that support for the pipeline is reasonable, as a significant portion of the public (i.e., Republicans and independents) backs it, aligning with right-leaning political ideologies.

6. ""Breitbart News reported on how Biden’s decision to shut down Keystone through an executive order on his first day in office cost as many as 11,000 American jobs.""
   - The inclusion of a report from Breitbart News, a media outlet known for its conservative bias, and the emphasis on the alleged loss of American jobs due to Biden's decision, appeals to economic and nationalist concerns. This suggests a criticism of left-leaning or Democratic policies from a conservative perspective, emphasizing the negative impacts of those policies on domestic labor.

In summary, the language and rhetoric in the article suggest an underlying conservative or right-leaning political ideology, emphasizing the benefits of traditional energy projects, citing potential job losses due to a halt in such projects, and expressing a preference for North American solutions to energy problems. The framing of the information, the sourcing from conservative media, and the highlighting of polls in favor of contested energy projects are all elements that indicate a particular bias or viewpoint."
breitbart,Immigration,"Celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, told reporters he would forego specific security clearances provided to U.S. Senators in order to maintain his dual citizenship with Turkey.

Oz reportedly said he would choose his Turkish citizenship over receiving certain security clearances. “I can love my country and love my mom,” Oz’s said, whose mother suffers from Alzheimer’s disease.

When asked about his dual citizenship with the United States and Turkey, Oz explained that he keeps his Turkish citizenship to care for his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’s Disease. When queried what he would do if this would disqualify him from security clearances, Oz stated that he would forego them in this situation, noting “I can love my country and love my mom.” His parents were born in Turkey and under Turkish nationality law, children born to a Turkish mother or a Turkish father are Turkish citizens from birth. Oz served in the Turkish military to maintain dual citizenship.

Although federal law does not prevent dual nationals from serving in Congress, pundits have raised concerns over Oz’s willingness to maintain dual citizenship.

“Oz’s dual citizenship – and his reluctance to renounce Turkish citizenship – will keep the FBI and security managers up at night,” said American Enterprise Institute’s Michael Rubin.

Council of Foreign Relations senior fellow Steve Cook had this to say:

Is he really an agent of the government? There’s not really any evidence of that. But if Oz has business connections that rely on being in the good graces of the government, there are legitimate questions about his views on these issues.

Oz spoke about his desire to maintain Turkish citizenship on the same day reports revealed he is in talks to return to television if his Senate candidacy is unsuccessful. “No one wants to admit defeat, but he isn’t a stupid man. He knows his campaign is on life support. Like any good doctor, he is already looking for alternatives to keep his career alive if he doesn’t win,” a source said.

With the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary scheduled for May 17, Oz has a lot of ground to make up if he wants to win the Republican nomination. A recent poll found Oz trailing Republican candidate David McCormick by nine points.","Mehmet Oz, a candidate for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, has communicated to the press his decision to waive certain security clearances typically available to U.S. Senators due to his personal choice to retain his dual citizenship with Turkey.

Oz, whose mother has Alzheimer’s disease, has expressed that keeping his Turkish citizenship allows him to provide her with care. He has indicated that his familial duties would take precedence over obtaining these clearances if they were to conflict with his dual status. Oz, born to Turkish parents, holds Turkish citizenship by birthright and fulfilled his military service obligations in Turkey as a means to maintain his dual nationality.

While dual nationals are not prohibited by federal law from serving in Congress, the topic has been discussed by various commentators.

Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute noted the complications that dual citizenship might pose for security assessments. 

Steve Cook, a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, commented on the situation by addressing speculative concerns over Oz's business connections and their potential impact on policy positions, while acknowledging the lack of evidence suggesting any governmental agency ties.

In related news, Oz has also been mentioned as potentially exploring opportunities to return to television should his bid for the Senate not succeed. A source familiar with the situation noted Oz’s practical approach to his career prospects in light of the campaign’s challenges.

As the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary approaches on May 17, polls have shown Oz to be trailing behind fellow Republican candidate David McCormick, adding urgency to his campaign efforts.","The political ideology in the article seems to highlight concerns regarding national loyalty and the potential conflict of interest that dual citizenship could bring to a public office role, as well as possibly casting doubt on Dr. Mehmet Oz's commitment to the Senate race. Below are some examples:

1. **""Celebrity doctor""**
   - The term ""celebrity doctor"" can imply that Dr. Oz is primarily known for his media presence rather than his political or professional qualifications, which can suggest a bias against non-traditional or outsider candidates associated with conservative ideology that values traditional governance experience.

2. **""Oz reportedly said he would choose his Turkish citizenship over receiving certain security clearances.""**
   - Highlighting Oz's choice to prioritize Turkish citizenship can be seen as questioning his loyalty to the United States, tapping into nationalist or conservative concerns about the singular allegiance of elected officials.

3. **""pundits have raised concerns""**
   - This is a vague attribution that allows the article to express skepticism without taking a direct stance. It leans on the authority of unnamed ""pundits"" to introduce the concern about dual loyalty without claiming it explicitly, a technique that can suggest a conservative viewpoint that values strict national loyalty.

4. **""will keep the FBI and security managers up at night""**
   - This quote from Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute (a conservative think-tank) evokes fear or concern about security issues, thereby appealing to conservative values centered around national security and the importance of a clear national allegiance.

5. **""Is he really an agent of the government?""**
   - Even though this statement by Steve Cook ends with a clarification that there is no evidence of Oz being a government agent, the very posing of the question plants a seed of doubt about Oz's loyalties, resonating with ideologies that are wary of foreign influence in government.

6. **""his campaign is on life support""**
   - The use of a medical metaphor like ""life support"" to describe Oz's campaign suggests it is in a dire, perhaps terminal state. This could indicate a bias implying that his political efforts are futile and on the verge of failure, which could be a view held by political groups that oppose his candidacy.

7. **""No one wants to admit defeat, but he isn’t a stupid man.""**
   - This quote insinuates that Oz is pragmatic and opportunistic about his career options, which can be construed to underscore a viewpoint that he is not fully committed to the political race or service but rather to his personal advancement. This might resonate with a skeptical or cynical view of outsider candidates in politics, which can be found across the ideological spectrum.

These examples show language that can subtly convey political bias or ideology, generally leaning towards a conservative perspective with concerns about national security and the implications of dual citizenship. The narrative also questions the legitimacy and viability of Oz's candidacy, potentially aligning with a viewpoint against celebrity or outsider political candidates."
breitbart,Police,"Former President Donald Trump will rally with supporters in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, the same evening President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama will team up for a final rally together ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday.

Trump will campaign with Dr. Mehmet Oz, his hand-selected candidate for the Senate race while Obama and Biden will campaign with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democrat nominee struggling to recover from a stroke that occurred in May.

Biden believes his politics are strongest in Pennsylvania, as he has visited the state on multiple occasions to campaign for Democrat candidates and promote his economic agenda.

“This election is not a referendum. It’s a choice,” Biden told Pennsylvania Democrats at a party dinner last week. “A choice between two vastly different visions of America.”

Biden prided himself on winning Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election after Trump shocked the political world by winning the state and its 20 electoral votes in the 2016 election.

The president continues preaching his belief in taxing the wealthy more and giving the working and middle classes more government benefits, as he says, so they can “just have a little bit of breathing room.”

But as Democrats face tough political headwinds, Biden is reaching out to his old boss for assistance in motivating Democrats to get back to the polls.

The Obama and Biden rally in Philadelphia is where Democrats are making their last stand, hoping that Biden’s first two years as president will inspire Democrats to stand with him despite concerns about crime, inflation, and high gas prices.

But Trump is eager for a rematch, viewing Biden as a weak political force that will collapse in the face of eager Republicans, and some independents who are ready for a change.

Trump is campaigning outside of Pittsburgh, where his political message continues to resonate as rural supporters in the state fly their Trump flags and more aggressive flags denouncing Biden.

As president, Trump famously vowed to represent “Pittsburgh, not Paris” and continues to campaign on making America great again by getting tough on crime, boosting the production of American energy, and lowering inflation.

The showdown in Pennsylvania will signal where the state and the country are going as both Trump and Biden are eyeing their presidential campaigns in 2024.","Former President Donald Trump is set to hold a rally in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday night. This event coincides with President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama’s joint appearance at a rally ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections.

In Pennsylvania, Trump is supporting Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz, while on the Democratic side, Biden and Obama are backing Lt. Gov. John Fetterman for the Senate seat. Fetterman is returning to the campaign trail following a stroke earlier in the year.

President Biden has been an active presence in Pennsylvania, repeatedly visiting to support Democratic candidates and discuss his economic policies.

During a recent speech to Pennsylvania Democrats, Biden emphasized the significance of the upcoming election, framing it as a decision between “two vastly different visions of America.”

Biden has a history in Pennsylvania, having won the state in the 2020 presidential election. This was after Trump's unexpected victory there in 2016.

Biden's political platform includes proposals for tax reform that would affect the wealthy and expand benefits and support for working and middle-class families, intending to offer them more financial flexibility.

As the Democratic Party navigates current political challenges, Biden has joined forces with Obama to bolster voter turnout.

The Philadelphia rally is seen as a critical event for the Democrats, aiming to highlight the accomplishments of the past two years and motivate the party’s base amidst concerns regarding crime, inflation, and energy costs.

Meanwhile, Trump is hosting his event near Pittsburgh, a location where he has previously enjoyed strong support. His message remains focused on law enforcement, domestic energy production, and economic conditions, including inflation.

The Pennsylvania rallies will serve as an indicator of the political climate in the state and could provide insights into the strategies of both Trump and Biden as they consider potential runs for the presidency in 2024.","1. ""Trump will campaign with Dr. Mehmet Oz, his hand-selected candidate"" - This phrase suggests a top-down, authoritative approach, characteristic of ideologies that favor strong central leadership and may denote a paternalistic viewpoint. It can imply that the selection of candidates is not as democratic or grassroots-based but instead directed by a singular influential figure.

2. ""Biden will campaign with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democrat nominee struggling to recover from a stroke"" - This wording highlights Fetterman's health challenges, which could be seen as an attempt to frame him as potentially less capable, a technique often used by opponents to cast doubt on a candidate's fitness for office.

3. ""Biden prided himself on winning Pennsylvania"" - The use of ""prided himself"" may indicate a bias towards perceiving Biden as somewhat egotistic or self-congratulatory, a characterization common in partisan critiques that aim to depict an individual as self-absorbed.

4. ""The president continues preaching his belief in taxing the wealthy more"" - The word ""preaching"" has connotations of moralistic lecturing, which could suggest a bias against Biden's economic policies, framing them as impractical idealism rather than pragmatic solutions.

5. ""Democrats face tough political headwinds"" - Referring to difficulties as ""tough political headwinds"" is a metaphor suggesting that the Democrats' challenges are external forces beyond their control, often used to elicit sympathy or understanding from the reader.

6. ""Biden is reaching out to his old boss for assistance"" - The phrase ""old boss"" implies a relationship structure and could subtly undermine the current status of Biden by insinuating dependency or a lesser position relatively.

7. ""Democrats are making their last stand"" - This dramatic language imbues the event with a sense of finality and desperation. It's a phrase commonly associated with a beleaguered group facing an existential threat, a framing which can sway the reader to view the situation as dire.

8. ""Trump is eager for a rematch"" - The use of ""eager for a rematch"" suggests a competitive, perhaps aggressive stance of Trump that aligns with combative political ideologies where electoral politics is seen as a battle or sport.

9. ""viewing Biden as a weak political force that will collapse"" - Describing Biden as a ""weak political force"" plays into narratives that promote strength as a key political virtue, which is often aligned with conservative or authoritarian ideologies.

10. ""Trump flags and more aggressive flags denouncing Biden"" - Mentioning ""more aggressive flags"" signals disapproval of overtly confrontational political behavior, which may imply a bias favoring more civil political discourse, typically associated with centrist or moderate ideologies.

11. ""vowed to represent 'Pittsburgh, not Paris'"" - Citing this vow can resonate with isolationist or nationalist ideologies, which prioritize local concerns and industries over global agreements, presenting an 'America First' message inherent in Trump's platform.

12. ""making America great again"" - This is Trump's campaign slogan and is indicative of a nationalist and populist political ideology, suggesting a past golden era and implying the need for restoration, which plays into conservative beliefs of decline and renewal.

The language used in this article contains signals suggesting a slight bias against both Trump and Biden, framed through the narrative choices and descriptive language that emphasize their weaknesses or potential downsides more than their strengths or accomplishments."
breitbart,Police,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that “there were no identifiable victims” in a case where she reduced the prison sentence of a self-proclaimed drug “kingpin.”

During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jackson was asked about the case of convicted drug trafficker Keith Young whom, in 2018, she sentenced to 20 years in prison, but later reduced the sentence.

Young trafficked heroin laced with fentanyl, the deadly drug just one kilogram of which can kill half a million people. There are a million milligrams in one kilogram.

When asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) if she had contacted the victims before reducing Young’s sentence, Jackson suggested that “there were no identifiable victims.”

The exchange went as follows:

COTTON: Judge Jackson, before you granted this fentanyl kingpin’s motion to reduce his sentence, did you contact any of the victims in his case? JACKSON: Senator, thank you for allowing me to address Mr. Young’s situation. COTTON: I asked a simple question, did you contact the victims in his case or not? JACKSON: Senator, Mr. Young was not released. His sentence was reduced and I did not contact the victims in this case because there were no victims. He committed a crime, a drug crime. There were no identifiable victims in his case. COTTON: Drug crimes are not victimless crimes — 100,000 Americans are killed by overdoses. JACKSON: Understood Senator, but there was no one to contact because there were no identifiable…

As Cotton noted, Jackson initially apologized to Young for having to sentence him to 20 years in prison. Following passage of the First Step Act and amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Young requested compassionate release from federal prison.

Though Jackson denied the request, she rewarded him with a reduced sentence that cut his time in prison by at least seven years. Young bragged about his role as a drug “kingpin” and was authorizing payments for drugs while in prison before Jackson cut his sentence.

“You reduced his sentence. He didn’t file a motion to reduce his sentence. He wasn’t eligible for a reduced sentence under the First Step Act because it wasn’t retroactive toward him,” Cotton said.

“You took a motion for compassionate release, to get out of prison, and turned it into a motion to reduce a sentence so he is going to be released seven and a half years earlier, years from now,” he continued.

Across the United States, drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in recent years. From April 2020 to April 2021, for example, more than 100,000 Americans died from overdoses. Deaths from overdoses now outpace the number of Americans killed from car crashes and guns, combined.

At her confirmation hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jackson was pressed about her past judicial decisions, including one case involving drug offender Keith Young.

In 2018, Judge Jackson sentenced Young to 20 years imprisonment for trafficking heroin mixed with fentanyl. The potency of fentanyl is such that even one kilogram can be exceedingly hazardous, containing enough doses to impact a large number of individuals.

During the hearing, Senator Tom Cotton asked Jackson if she reached out to any victims before deciding to reduce Young’s sentence. Jackson responded by explaining that Young was not released and that his sentence reduction did not involve identifiable victims in the context of a drug crime, hence there were no victims to contact.

Senator Cotton challenged this perspective, stressing the broader impact of drug crimes on society and linking them to overdose deaths. He mentioned that drug crimes can have devastating consequences as they are linked to a significant number of fatalities in the United States.

Following the implementation of the First Step Act and during a time when the country was dealing with the outbreak of COVID-19, Young sought a compassionate release from federal custody. While Judge Jackson denied his request to be released, she did modify his sentence, leading to a reduction of the time he would ultimately serve.

Senator Cotton pointed out that the reduction in Young's sentence was not related to the First Step Act since the act was not retroactive in his case. Instead, Judge Jackson's decision meant that Young would serve a shorter sentence than initially mandated.

The number of overdose deaths in the United States has been rising, with more than 100,000 Americans reported to have died from overdoses during a 12-month period from April 2020 to April 2021. This figure exceeds the number of deaths from car crashes and gun-related incidents combined.

The third day of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation hearing can be accessed for public viewing.

""self-proclaimed drug 'kingpin'"" - The use of the term ""kingpin,"" especially in quotes, suggests a degree of skepticism about the defendant's actual power or influence in the drug trade. This could indicate a bias toward minimizing the impact of drug trafficking or an underlying viewpoint that sympathizes with criminal defendants.
   
   Context: The term is used to describe Keith Young in a way that emphasizes his role in drug trafficking, which could be seen as an attempt to highlight the severity of his actions.

2. ""When asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)..."" - Mentioning the political affiliation of Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) provides readers with information about his potential bias. This is a common journalistic practice, but the context can indicate the article's political leanings if it juxtaposes partisan figures with neutral or sympathetic portrayals of others.
   
   Context: The article is setting up a challenging line of questioning from a Republican senator to a Democratic president's Supreme Court nominee, suggesting a partisan lens.

3. ""COTTON: Drug crimes are not victimless crimes..."" - This quote is presented without rebuttal, implying agreement with the perspective that all drug crimes inherently have victims. This stance is often associated with more conservative viewpoints on criminal justice.
   
   Context: By highlighting this statement, the article may be aiming to criticize the nominee's view on drug-related crimes and their impact on society.

4. ""Jackson initially apologized to Young for having to sentence him to 20 years in prison."" - The mention of an apology to the defendant can be read as criticism, suggesting that the judge was too empathetic towards a criminal, which aligns with a conservative ideology that favors tougher sentencing.
   
   Context: This is meant to establish a perspective that Judge Jackson's behavior in the courtroom may not be sufficiently harsh on those who commit serious crimes.

5. ""...amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis..."" - The phrase ""Chinese coronavirus"" has been used in some political circles to emphasize the point of origin of the virus. This terminology has been flagged as potentially problematic because it can contribute to xenophobia and racial stigmatization. The choice to use this term over more neutral options like COVID-19 could indicate an ideological leaning.
   
   Context: The use of this term suggests a political bias that falls in line with certain conservative narratives that focus on the geographic origin of the coronavirus, often associated with the intent to assign blame.

6. ""Though Jackson denied the request, she rewarded him with a reduced sentence..."" - The use of the term ""rewarded"" implies criticism of the decision to reduce the sentence, as if the judge were giving a gift to the criminal rather than making a legal judgment. This suggests a viewpoint that is critical of criminal justice reform or leniency.
   
   Context: This language portrays the judge's action as too lenient, potentially indicating an ideological stance that favors more punitive approaches to justice.

7. ""John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News."" - Breitbart News is widely recognized as a platform with conservative, right-leaning tendencies. The association of the reporter with this outlet may indicate the overall ideological slant of the article.

dailykos,Abortion,"I was out of the country in May when news of the SCOTUS leak in which Justice Samuel Alito’s policy statement went viral. I hadn’t watched TV for a week and barely signed onto social media but when I did, I read astute and deeply troubling reactions to the document designed to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has been considered established law for 50 years.

The document Justice Alito wrote was supported by four of his Court colleagues, revealing unsurprisingly that a majority of the Court concurred with ending women’s right to abortion. The timing of the leak was significant; it occurred when the Court was scheduled to rule on the constitutionality of a Mississippi abortion law which prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

If the Court finds that the Mississippi law stands, it will have sanctioned ending Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws regarding abortion. Some states have already established Draconian laws that include charging women with murder if they miscarry or have an abortion. Some have ruled that physicians who perform abortions can be charged with a felony crime and some have set up vigilante laws that could affect anyone who helps a woman get an abortion.

Essentially the demise of the constitutional right to abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy will end women’s right to abortion in over half the states in this country. The implications are huge, not only for American women but for the future of the country, and they are abundantly clear.

Many analysts and pundits have written cogently and urgently about the legal, physical, economic and emotional consequences for women and others in this country, and for all of us with respect to our civil and human rights. As a women’s health educator and advocate I am all too familiar with those consequences. I have heard women’s testimonials, read their memoirs, listened to their stories. I have helped them access abortion care and as a doula I have helped them give birth to much wanted babies.

After the Alito document was revealed (and during the last confirmation hearings) I thought about the great legal minds of the past who had served on the Supreme Court, Justices like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg among them. Now I mourn what has become of that institution, where several judges lied under oath to Congress regarding precedent, and where many are willing to ignore the Constitution’s 4th amendment right of Americans to be “secure in their persons” and to “not be violated or subjected to “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

It pains and frightens me that faulty - some might say puerile logic - superficial, antiquated, cliched justifications, overt sexism, and religious ideology are blatantly on display. (It is worth noting that seven of the current justices are Catholic and no Protestants are on the bench).

Couple that with the less than stellar records and legal experience of several justices, the alleged sexual harassment conduct of two justices, the conflict of interest on the part of a justice whose wife actively supported the insurrection, along with the majority’s willing abrogation of civil and human rights and one can question where “liberty and justice for all” has gone.

How, I ask myself in these traumatic judgment days, has this largely trusted American institution so quickly deteriorated into depravity? How did its majority come to rely on bumper sticker taglines, social media tropes, and arguments so weak and sloppy that they wouldn’t pass muster in a law school? Where has compassionate consideration in difficult matters gone? Why have context, untoward consequences, and the reality of people’s lives disappeared?

The fact is the Supreme Court has become a political organization with its own dark agenda and its reputation will forever be tarnished, all because four men and one woman who should know better, appointed by a far right, self-serving autocrat, are now seated for life on the highest court in the land, along with several hundred inappropriate federal judges.

The price we’ll all pay for judicial travesties, individually and together, grows ever clearer and more threatening. If Roe v. Wade is overturned women’s lives will be destroyed. Precedent in other matters (gay and interracial marriage, LGBTG rights and more) will no longer be valid, and revision of laws that wreak havoc because of ignorance and a taste for punishment will return.

It is no stretch to say that we will become an even more divided and dangerous nation, two-tiered and binary in ways that we can’t yet imagine. Violence is likely to flourish along with racism, anti-Semitism, sexism and increased marginalization. The elderly, young, disabled, and ill will suffer even more profoundly. Murder charges, incarcerations and suicides will become commonplace. Poverty will prevail for those in the 99 percent, while corporations and billionaires flourish. Family structures will be deeply and sadly impacted. The earth will be at risk sooner than predicted.

This is not solely about women’s rights, and it is not hyperbole. It’s a harbinger of what is to come because of laws we must live with, who makes and enforces those laws, who adjudicates disputes, what national priorities are established and by whom. It is about the future, which now is in the hands of the Supreme Court – a court plunged into decline that endangers us all.

It’s a court that is beyond disappointing, a court with extraordinary power to shape our lives, and it grows ever more dangerous.","In May, there was significant public attention on a leaked draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito from the U.S. Supreme Court. The draft indicated that a majority of the justices supported a change in the legal framework regarding abortion, 50 years after Roe v. Wade had been settled.

Justice Alito's draft, which was joined by four of his colleagues, suggested that the Court might be open to upholding a Mississippi law that restricts abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, which could lead to a shift in the legal status quo concerning abortion rights.

If the Court ultimately rules in favor of the Mississippi law, it could lead to a significant change in the way abortion is regulated in the United States, with some states potentially adopting more restrictive laws. Conversely, other states may maintain or implement policies that provide broader access to abortion services.

The draft opinion has triggered a wide array of responses and analyses regarding its potential legal, social, and economic impacts. Legal experts and commentators are examining the draft's implications on various levels, including privacy rights and access to healthcare services.

The leak has also rekindled discussions about the role of the Supreme Court in American society, its interpretation of the Constitution, and the precedent-setting nature of its decisions. Historical comparisons are being drawn with past Justices and landmark rulings as the nation contemplates shifts in its judicial landscape.

Amidst these discussions, there is emerging debate around the confirmation process of Supreme Court justices, the nature of the Court's composition in terms of religious affiliation, the professional background of the justices, and their adherence to ethical standards.

The issues raised by the leaked draft opinion are prompting a national dialogue about the direction of American jurisprudence, civil liberties, and the potential ramifications of high court decisions on the country's social fabric. The ongoing debate reflects a broad spectrum of perspectives and underscores the central role of the Supreme Court in shaping policy and societal norms in the United States.","The provided article illustrates a clear critical perspective toward the U.S. Supreme Court’s potential decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Examining the language and rhetoric, the underlying political ideology seems to lean toward a liberal or left-leaning viewpoint, emphasizing the defense of reproductive rights, criticizing the current makeup of the Court, and expressing concern for the Court's integrity and its impact on civil rights. Below are several examples (numbered) of the language used in the article that suggests this bias:

1. ""Justice Samuel Alito’s policy statement went viral.""
    - The term ""policy statement"" rather than ""draft opinion"" suggests that the author views the Justice's document more as a political move rather than a judicial one.

2. ""ending women’s right to abortion.""
    - The phrase ""ending"" carries a negative connotation, indicating the author’s belief that a fundamental right is being taken away.

3. ""Draconian laws that include charging women with murder if they miscarry or have an abortion.""
    - The word ""Draconian"" implies that the laws are excessively harsh and regressive, revealing opposition to strict anti-abortion measures.

4. ""the majority’s willing abrogation of civil and human rights.""
    - Describing the majority's action as ""willing abrogation"" characterizes the decisions of the justices as an intentional violation of rights, suggesting ideological motivations over legal principles.

5. ""faulty - some might say puerile logic - superficial, antiquated, cliched justifications, overt sexism, and religious ideology are blatantly on display.""
    - This series of negative descriptors indicate the author's view that the Court’s reasoning is flawed and motivated by outdated, sexist, and religious biases rather than sound legal interpretation.

6. ""seven of the current justices are Catholic and no Protestants are on the bench.""
    - This observation hints at the idea that religious homogeneity of the Court might influence its decisions in a way that the author believes is inappropriate for a diverse nation.

7. ""appointed by a far right, self-serving autocrat.""
    - Describing a president as a ""far right, self-serving autocrat"" is a clear display of disapproval and places the jurisprudence of the justices in the context of extreme and autocratic political leanings.

8. ""judicial travesties.""
    - The word ""travesties"" implies a mockery or distortion of justice, underscoring the author’s view that the actions of the Court are a perversion of what the judicial system is meant to be.

9. ""Violence is likely to flourish along with racism, anti-Semitism, sexism and increased marginalization.""
    - This dire prediction infers that the potential decision is part of a larger societal regression into discrimination and discord, indicating a belief that upholding Roe v. Wade is part of maintaining a more equitable society.

10. ""The earth will be at risk sooner than predicted.""
    - Evoking environmental concerns in conjunction with a discussion about the Court implies that the author views conservative decisions as inherently hazardous to climate policy, suggesting a more progressive environmental stance.

These examples specify a liberal or progressive ideology that prioritizes reproductive rights alongside broader civil rights concerns, distrusts the current Supreme Court composition due to perceived religious and political biases, and maintains a generally pessimistic view of the conservatives' social agenda."
dailykos,Abortion,"First, I love Joe Biden. I haven’t changed my opinion of him since day 1. Second, I’m a progressive, but I’m a pragmatist. Biden is not a moderate on the full political spectrum, he’s definitely a Dem. Within the Democratic party, he’s right about in the middle. He wants some (maybe all) student debt forgiveness; he wants some no-cost college options; he is definitely pro women’s rights and pro democracy. He knows he can’t get everything he wants, or the rest of us, but he is willing to fight for some.

He is not a neocon. He got our nation out of its longest war. He has supported the people of Ukraine, way before it was popular. He believes in science, and also his faith. Lots of things I love about Joe. Uninformed people too often blame the president for the inactions of certain senators or congress members, or to anti-democratic filibuster rules, which result in the administration’s goals not being accomplished.

Unless the reproductive rights issue is resolved (somehow) this year, either by eliminating the filibuster or by judicial changes of mind/changes of number (on SCOTUS) … the 2024 presidential/senate/congressional elections will be the biggest fight ever for the individual rights of not only women, but also others that the conservatives have long dreamed of marginalizing.

“Oh, the GOP would never get away with rescinding marriage equality,” some might say. “Too many Americans are fine with it and even supportive.” — Well, 60% or more of Americans think that abortion and contraceptive rights should be legal, even though some of that number may not personally like the thought. And according to the CDC (www.cdc.gov/...), about 65% of women aged 15-49 use contraception. (So, 65% of half of females in the USA, who are about 51% of all Americans.

And only 33% of the Supreme Court is female, none of whom are in that age range.) Wanna gamble on the outcome if they were to rule on it?

If we still need to protect and enshrine, personal, biological and reproductive rights in 2024, I think we must have a female candidate for president. Who? I am not sure. I like Kamala a lot, and she is obviously the best-positioned to mount a campaign, but I am not sold on her ability to connect more widely. And many of the most powerful female politicians that have a national audience, are more senior in age and that might hinder them.

Aside from Kamala, Warren, and Clinton, who do you see as the most viable female presidential candidate if it is necessary — and Joe Biden supports it- to change presidential candidates in 2024? (Let me state again that I am not not not anti-Joe Biden).

If we can prevent this republican attack on human rights in some other way, I want Joe to run again. But if we need to make individual rights the cornerstone of the 2024 elections, our candidate MUST be a woman.","Joe Biden has established a position in the political landscape that resonates with many for his policies on student debt forgiveness, advocating for no-cost college options, and supporting women’s rights and democratic principles. While understanding the complexities of governance and the challenges inherent in the legislative process, his administration has pursued various goals within these areas.

The conclusion of the United States' longest war and the support extended to Ukraine, even before it became a widespread concern, are part of his administration's foreign policy initiatives. His approach has been to balance scientific considerations with personal faith in addressing national issues.

It is often the case that presidents face criticism for stalled initiatives, which can also be attributed to legislative hurdles, such as filibuster rules, or opposition within Congress.

Looking ahead to future elections, issues such as reproductive rights are expected to play a significant role. Current discussions involve the possibility of procedural changes in the Senate or shifts in Supreme Court dynamics that may impact such rights.

Public opinion polls suggest that a majority of Americans support the legality of abortion and contraceptive rights, with a significant percentage of women using contraception. These factors may influence judicial rulings on related matters.

Considering the potential candidates for the presidential race, there's an acknowledgment of the depth of experienced and influential female politicians who could be viable contenders. While Vice President Kamala Harris is noted for her prominent position and potential candidacy, the discussion remains open regarding other potential candidates who might effectively champion individual rights.

The preservation of human rights is highlighted as a critical issue that may shape the campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. There is a suggestion that having a female candidate for president might be instrumental in these efforts, reflecting an emphasis on representation and advocacy for personal, biological, and reproductive rights.","1. ""First, I love Joe Biden.""
   - This phrase indicates a personal affection and likely a political alignment with the current President, Joe Biden, suggesting a bias leaning towards the Democratic Party and possibly towards the political ideologies that Biden represents.

2. ""I haven’t changed my opinion of him since day 1.""
   - This suggests a consistent and unwavering support for Biden, implying approval of his policies and actions, and thereby indicating a political stance that is in line with mainstream Democratic beliefs.

3. ""I’m a progressive, but I’m a pragmatist.""
   - The self-identification as a ""progressive"" signals a political ideology that favors reforms and changes, particularly in social and economic issues, aimed at creating a more equitable society. The addition of ""pragmatist"" indicates a belief in practical solutions and a potential willingness to compromise, rather than pursuing ideologically pure but possibly less attainable goals.

4. ""Biden is not a moderate on the full political spectrum,...Within the Democratic party, he’s right about in the middle.""
   - This statement characterizes Biden as centrist within the broader context of the Democratic party, which suggests a bias towards a more moderate, yet still Democratic approach to politics.

5. ""He wants some (maybe all) student debt forgiveness; he wants some no-cost college options; he is definitely pro women’s rights and pro democracy.""
   - The support for policies like student debt forgiveness, no-cost college options, and women’s rights portrays a progressive political stance oriented towards social justice and equity.

6. ""He knows he can’t get everything he wants...but he is willing to fight for some.""
   - This acknowledges the practical limitations of what a president can achieve, emphasizing a pragmatic approach to political change.

7. ""He is not a neocon.""
   - The term ""neocon"" refers to a neoconservative, often associated with aggressive foreign policies. By stating that Biden is not a neocon, the writer is distancing their ideology from conservative or militaristic approaches in international relations.

8. ""Unless the reproductive rights issue is resolved...the 2024 presidential/senate/congressional elections will be the biggest fight ever for the individual rights...""
   - The focus on reproductive rights and the framing of upcoming elections as a ""biggest fight ever"" for these rights reveals an ideological commitment to progressive social policies and concerns about conservative agendas.

9. ""“Oh, the GOP would never get away with rescinding marriage equality,” some might say.""
   - The hypothetical counterargument serves to pre-emptively refute conservative positions on key social issues, demonstrating a progressive bias.

10. ""If we still need to protect and enshrine, personal, biological and reproductive rights in 2024, I think we must have a female candidate for president.""
    - Advocating for a female presidential candidate specifically to champion reproductive rights signifies an ideological belief in the importance of representation and in the connection between gender and policy perspective.

11. ""our candidate MUST be a woman.""
    - This absolute statement reflects a belief that gender is critical to political representation, particularly regarding issues that primarily affect women, and is indicative of a progressive, feminist viewpoint.

The writer's political ideology, as indicated by these snippets from the article, reveals a clear progressive bias with a strong emphasis on gender equality, reproductive rights, and pragmatic political solutions within the Democratic Party framework."
dailykos,COVID,"In a recent issue of Grasping Reality Newsletter Brad DeLong appears to dismiss current fears by economists across the ideological spectrum and echoed by the mainstream press of runaway inflation in the US economy. He seems to believe the current jump in perceived inflation is simply the economy catching up after the COVID slowdown exacerbated by the lagging gear up of the supply chain

But so far, rising inflation has not been incorporated into any of the “sticky” prices in the economy, according to the measure constructed by the Atlanta Federal Reserve. True, the financial market’s current 30-year breakeven inflation rate, at 2.35%, is more than half a percentage point above where it settled in the second half of the 2010s. But today’s rate is similar to that in the first half of the decade, and slightly below the level that would be consistent with the US Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% per year. The current uptick in US inflation is highly likely to be simply rubber on the road, resulting from the post-pandemic recovery. There is no sign that inflation expectations have become de-anchored. The labor market is still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in real wages. Financial markets are blasé about the possibility of rising inflation. And a substantial fiscal contraction is already in train. Given these facts, why would anybody argue that the “original sin” was the “oversized American Rescue Plan,” and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate it? I, for one, simply cannot follow their logic.

Ryan Avent: Inflation: ‘The carping about inflation really irks me, because I’m not so certain that there is. As noted before, consumer prices are up 6.2% over the past 12 months. It is also the case that real GDP (adjusted for inflation) is up 5% over the past 12 months, and employment is up by about 5.8m jobs. The American economy, notably, has surpassed its pre-pandemic level of economic output while other rich economies, like the euro area, have not. Even so, consumer prices in the euro area have risen by more than 4% over the past year, which is a lot, especially if you’re a German. Had there been less American stimulus, there would have been less inflation, but there would also have been less growth in output and employment. It is possible that less stimulus might have meant a lot less inflation and only a little less of the other stuff. But on the other hand, unemployment is much costlier than inflation, so you really would need quite a lot less inflation for not much less employment growth to break even, so to speak, relative to the reality in which we find ourselves…

While I tend to agree with them regarding the actual state of the economy, I am distressed with their implied recommendation to “leave it alone” and hope that “it will all work out.” Economics and Politics are separate only in the minds of academics. The appearance of doing something, of moving quickly and forcefully to address the perceived crisis even if it is a fantasy is necessary to allow things to work out or most certainly those seeking to profit from the perceived crisis will move the firmament to assure it does not do so on your watch. It is not enough to call a meeting of poobahs or issue press releases that things are or will work out. A distinct specific executive action should be taken immediately claiming it will mitigate or end end the crisis so that when the expected slowing of the perceived inflation bubble occurs it will appear as though it was due to the timely and perceptive action by the chief-executive.","In a recent issue of Grasping Reality Newsletter, Brad DeLong analyzed the data regarding the current inflation rates in the context of the US economy’s recovery from the COVID-related slowdown and the challenges faced by the supply chain in gearing up to meet demand.

According to data provided by the measure constructed by the Atlanta Federal Reserve, rising inflation has not yet affected the “sticky” prices within the economy. The financial market’s current 30-year breakeven inflation rate is at 2.35%, which is over half a percentage point above where it settled in the latter half of the 2010s, but still comparable to rates seen in the earlier part of that decade, and is slightly below the level that aligns with the US Federal Reserve’s annual inflation target of 2%. Observations of the economic trends suggest that the recent rise in inflation is likely a byproduct of economic rebounding from the pandemic. There is no indication that inflation expectations have destabilized significantly. The employment market has not sufficiently recovered to a point where it’s driving significant wage increases. Financial markets have generally shown a lack of concern for potential inflation spikes. Additionally, a notable reduction in fiscal spending is underway. These factors contribute to ongoing discussions about the timing and impact of policy measures such as those encompassed in the American Rescue Plan and monetary policy adjustments.

Ryan Avent expressed his perspective on the matter, pointing out that over the past year consumer prices have increased by 6.2%, real GDP has seen a 5% uptick, and employment has risen by approximately 5.8 million jobs. The United States has managed to exceed its pre-pandemic level of economic output, which distinguishes it from some other advanced economies. For example, despite the consumer price index in the euro area increasing by more than 4% in the past year, countries like those in the euro area have not achieved a similar level of economic performance. Avent notes the balancing act between stimulus measures and their effects on inflation and growth, suggesting that less stimulus could mean reduced inflation but potentially at the cost of economic growth and job creation. Given the high costs associated with unemployment compared to those associated with inflation, Avent's analysis seems to indicate that the potential trade-offs need to be carefully evaluated.

Avent also shared his views on the role of economic policy and action, preferring immediate and decisive action that addresses economic issues as they arise rather than adopting a ""wait and see"" approach. He suggests that executive actions should be implemented with the intent to alleviate or resolve economic challenges to ensure that the measures taken contribute positively to the anticipated economic outcomes.","1. ""Brad DeLong appears to dismiss current fears by economists across the ideological spectrum"" - This phrase suggests that the writer believes DeLong is not taking a widely acknowledged concern seriously. The use of ""appears to dismiss"" implies a potential bias of downplaying concerns that may be considered mainstream or consensus across various ideologies.

2. ""The current jump in perceived inflation"" - The use of ""perceived"" suggests that the writer is questioning the reality or seriousness of the inflation issue, indicating a possible bias toward a view that the worries about inflation might be overblown or not as significant as presented by others.

3. ""Rising inflation has not been incorporated into any of the 'sticky' prices in the economy"" - This statement implies a specific economic viewpoint that distinguishes between types of inflation and argues against an alarmist perspective on inflation, suggesting that not all sectors are affected or that the situation is not as critical as it may seem.

4. ""The labor market is still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in real wages"" - Here the language used portrays a belief in the labor market's lack of strength, which might suggest an ideology oriented towards worker rights or labor protection, arguing implicitly that workers do not currently have enough bargaining power.

5. ""A substantial fiscal contraction is already in train"" - The choice of the word ""substantial"" and the phrase ""already in train"" convey a certainty about fiscal policy direction, which might align with a political ideology that favors fiscal responsibility or austerity measures.

6. ""Ryan Avent: Inflation: ‘The carping about inflation really irks me..."" - The colloquial word ""carping"" expresses annoyance and dismissal towards those who are expressing concerns about inflation, indicating Avent's bias towards regarding the inflation criticism as nitpicking or unjustified.

7. ""Even so, consumer prices in the euro area have risen by more than 4% over the past year, which is a lot, especially if you’re a German"" - The phrase ""especially if you're a German"" plays on the stereotype of Germans being particularly averse to inflation due to historical events, and may reveal an underlying viewpoint that expectations and fears regarding inflation are not just economic concerns but are also culturally influenced.

8. ""Had there been less American stimulus, there would have been less inflation, but there would also have been less growth in output and employment"" - The balance of trade-offs here suggests an ideology that favors economic stimulus and growth even at the risk of higher inflation, a perspective often associated with Keynesian economic thought.

9. ""Economics and Politics are separate only in the minds of academics"" - This statement suggests a pragmatic or realist political ideology that rejects the notion that economic policy can be isolated from political considerations, indicating a belief that effective governance must account for both.

10. ""A distinct specific executive action should be taken immediately claiming it will mitigate or end the crisis"" - This prescription for action implies support for a proactive, perhaps interventionist government approach to economic management, aligning with ideologies that favor a strong and decisive executive role in addressing economic issues.

Overall, these phrases and the language used in the article suggest an underlying political ideology that leans towards Keynesian economics, a pragmatic view of policy intertwined with politics, and a belief in the necessity of government intervention to manage economic perceptions and realities."
dailykos,COVID,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) has been running a heavy flight of campaign ads across state TV channels in the past week or so, blaming Democrats and President Biden for high gas prices, deficit spending, and inflation. Even though It's all way too pat and simplistic, I imagine those lies will work on some GOP base voters. Still, they are lies. Even Politifact Wisconsin sees that, so far focusing only on the senator's gasoline-price claims. But trust me, the rest of RoJo's ad is equally misleading. After all:

In four years Trumpublicans including Johnson ran up the national debt by nearly eight thousand billion dollars (for the zero-challenged that's $8,000,000,000,000). Meanwhile that little inconvenience called the COVID pandemic -- which has killed ONE MILLION Americans officially and unofficially up to six times that many -- triggered a giant recession all by itself. Clearly Biden's fault -- not. But Johnson's and Trump's slow and disbelieving reactions surely made the pandemic worse.

And now the Russia-Ukraine war is further ramping up the worldwide supply-chain problem and putting further pressure on prices. But the senator wears blinders to all that and expects you to don a horse halter along with him. Expect to bite hard into the metal bit when The Previous Guy and his minions pull back your reins some more, but don't blame Democratic lawmakers for steering you their way.

Maybe if GOP politicians including Johnson and Trump hadn't praised and coddled Vladimir Putin (and in Johnson's case shown up with other Republican congressmen on Putin's virtual doorstep in Moscow during one American Independence Day), we wouldn't have to deal with that last crisis, which Johnson like other Republicans would like to pin on Biden. Ridiculous. Nevertheless, thanks to the way campaigns and campaign spending now work, ,it will be hard though not impossible to kick this empty suit out of the Senate in November. Do not doubt that we of good conscience in Wisconsin are trying.","In recent advertising, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) has attributed issues such as high gas prices, the current state of deficit spending, and rising inflation to the actions of Democrats and President Biden, an assertion debated by various fact-checking organizations, including Politifact Wisconsin, particularly in reference to his claims about gasoline prices.

With a considerable increase in the national debt occurring in the past years amidst unprecedented challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a substantial effect on both global health and the economy, the discourse around fiscal responsibility and pandemic management has become complex and multi-faceted. The response to the pandemic by various administrations has been a point of contention with differing views on how it was handled and its impact.

Additional strain on global logistics and economies now comes from the war in Ukraine, a conflict that has had wide-reaching implications on international relations and trade. This war and its consequences have sparked further discourse on the state of the economy and supply chains.

Sen. Johnson's stance on foreign policy, particularly in relation to Russia, has also been a topic of debate, with some suggesting that past actions by U.S. politicians could have played a role in the current international context.

Campaign narratives and election dynamics are an important aspect of the political process, and varying opinions and strategy debates are inherent to these times, especially leading up to significant elections. Voters are encouraged to consider the full spectrum of information and context when evaluating the claims and positions of any candidate.","The article critiques the political strategies and statements of Senator Ron Johnson and associates him with broader Republican narratives. Here are the examples indicating an ideological bias:

1. ""I imagine those lies will work on some GOP base voters. Still, they are lies.""
   - This phrase accuses Senator Johnson of lying in his campaign ads, suggesting a bias against the Senator and the GOP, and implying that their base voters might be susceptible to misinformation.

2. ""In four years Trumpublicans including Johnson ran up the national debt by nearly eight thousand billion dollars.""
   - The term ""Trumpublicans"" is a portmanteau of Trump and Republicans, carrying a negative connotation and implying that Republicans during Trump's presidency acted irresponsibly with the national debt.

3. ""Clearly Biden's fault -- not.""
   - This sarcastic comment implies that blaming President Biden for the pandemic-induced recession is unfounded and unfair, indicating a bias that absolves the current administration of blame.

4. ""But the senator wears blinders to all that and expects you to don a horse halter along with him.""
   - This metaphor suggests that Senator Johnson is intentionally ignoring the complexity of current issues and misleading his constituents, revealing a critical view of the Senator's stance.

5. ""Maybe if GOP politicians including Johnson and Trump hadn't praised and coddled Vladimir Putin...""
   - By connecting Johnson and Trump to Putin, the author criticizes their foreign policy, implying that their actions contributed to international tensions and their criticism of Biden is hypocritical.

6. ""Do not doubt that we of good conscience in Wisconsin are trying.""
   - By stating ""we of good conscience,"" the author positions themselves and likeminded individuals as morally superior to those supporting Senator Johnson, signaling a partisan and moral bias.

7. ""But don't blame Democratic lawmakers for steering you their way.""
   - This directs the reader not to attribute blame to Democrats, portraying them as not responsible for the negative outcomes Johnson is attributing to them, indicating a defense of the Democratic party and its policies.

The language used throughout the article suggests a bias against Senator Johnson, his political allies, and the Republican party. The rhetoric is critical of their policies, actions, and campaign strategies, and it displays support for Democratic positions by deflecting blame from Democratic lawmakers and framing Republican criticisms as misguided or dishonest."

""Here's an alternative perspective!""

Additionally, the current situation prompts reflection on recent changes and developments.

Could this be an effective approach?

Today, we have an interview with the co-founder and vice president of a political organization. The discussion includes the allocation of resources by various political groups to encourage voter turnout for the upcoming midterm elections. The effectiveness of different campaign strategies is a topic of interest. These are unprecedented times, and the implications for the midterms are complex and difficult to predict.

There's a call to participate in a letter-writing campaign aimed to reach voters in pivotal congressional districts and swing states, emphasizing the importance of voting in the election.

It has been noted that there are three U.S. Senate seats that have the potential to change party representation in the upcoming 2022 elections, and contributions to these races are suggested.","1. ""Here’s a nice chart showing the “average retail price” of gas in the United States from 2020 until now, care of GasBuddy.com""
   - The use of the word ""nice"" in this context could imply a sarcastic tone, suggesting a negative sentiment towards the reported increase in gas prices. By mentioning only the time ""from 2020 until now,"" and particularly in association with an increase in gas prices, the author might be subtly framing the current administration (presumably under President Biden) in a negative light.
   
2. ""And this is also a reminder of what we have lost under Biden.""
   - The phrase “what we have lost under Biden” clearly communicates disapproval of President Biden's tenure. The usage presumes that something has been lost during his administration without offering specific details, implying a political bias against the Biden administration.
   
3. ""Today on [show/platform], we speak with co-founder and vice president, [name]. Ancona comes in to discuss how grassroots progressive groups are spending money in the hopes of getting as many voters out for the midterm elections.""
   - The focus on “grassroots progressive groups” indicates a political leaning towards progressive ideologies. By giving a platform to discuss the strategies of progressive groups, the author could be signaling support for their cause.
   
4. ""We are living in historic times, and what that means for these midterms cannot be easily predicted—so Get Out The Vote!""
   - ""Get Out The Vote!"" is a rallying cry typically associated with encouraging political participation. In this context, since it follows the discussion about progressive groups, it can be inferred to resonate more with progressive or left-leaning political ideologies.
   
5. ""We need your help to write 10,000,000 letters to infrequent but Democratic-leaning prospective voters in key congressional districts and Senate swing states this election, urging them to exercise their right to vote.""
   - The direct appeal to mobilize Democratic-leaning voters is evident of a political bias towards the Democratic Party. By specifying the target demographic and the goal (""infrequent but Democratic-leaning prospective voters""), the author emphasizes a particular partisan perspective.
   
6. ""Daily Kos has identified three U.S. Senate seats that could flip from red to blue in 2022. Please donate $1 to each of these races right now.""
   - The appeal for donations to flip “red to blue” explicitly signifies a bias towards the Democratic Party, as ""red"" commonly represents the Republican Party and ""blue"" the Democratic Party in U.S. politics. The directive to “donate $1 to each of these races right now” is a call to action supporting Democratic candidates."
dailykos,Climate Change,"About an hour ago, the SEC approved a rules proposal to require any SEC publicly registered company to report their carbon emissions in their financial reports. This will open any number of interesting challenges to firms (assuming it survives court challenges — which is a significant risk).

The major requirements are listed by NPR here:

1. They must disclose risks to operations from climate risk — flooding from rising water for waterfront operations, probably insurance claims costs for insurers, etc.

2. They will need to report Scope 1 emissions — emissions from their own operations — and Scope 2 emissions — indirect emissions from generation of purchased energy

The inclusion of Scope 3 emissions — all other emissions not in Scope 1 and 2 — will be required to be reported if “material”.

Here is the nuance — incorrect reporting of information in your financial report is actionable by shareholders. Even more importantly, failing to report “material” information because you determined it to be “immaterial” is also actionable. If a company such as a major retailer were to not disclose any of its Scope 3 because it was ‘immaterial” would just be asking for a lawsuit — because all the emissions from the cargo ships would be Scope 3 emissions for that firm, as well as all the trucks, etc.

This is positioned to force companies to disclose. It is also likely to force them to disclose where they are using offsets — which also makes the offsets being used subject to scrutiny.

This may be of real value (or it could get completely watered down and washed away). It is something people should focus on and get ready to write comment letters to the SEC.","Recently, the SEC approved a proposal that mandates SEC publicly registered companies to include carbon emissions data within their financial reports. The potential implications of this new rule for companies could be varied.

According to NPR, the primary requirements are as follows:

1. Companies are required to disclose any significant climate-related risks that could impact their operations, such as increased flooding risks for waterfront facilities or higher insurance claim costs for insurers.

2. They are also required to report on two categories of emissions: Scope 1 emissions, which are direct emissions from a company's own activities, and Scope 2 emissions, which encompass indirect emissions from purchased energy.

3. In addition, companies may need to report Scope 3 emissions—which cover all other indirect emissions outside of Scope 1 and 2—if these are considered ""material.""

Financial accuracy is a must in these reports, as misrepresenting information can have legal ramifications. Companies will also need to carefully assess what is deemed ""material"" to avoid legal challenges, especially since Scope 3 emissions can include a wide range of activities, such as transportation and logistics.

The new requirement aims to enhance disclosure practices, and it includes reporting on the use of carbon offsets, which will be examined closely for their validity.

This development marks a significant step in accountability and transparency for companies regarding their environmental impact. The proposal is open for public comment and may evolve as feedback is received and addressed by the SEC.","1. ""assuming it survives court challenges — which is a significant risk""
   - The phrase suggests skepticism about the durability and legal solidity of the new rule, implying a belief that there is a strong opposition to regulation that may come from a pro-business or limited government perspective.

2. ""This will open any number of interesting challenges to firms""
   - The use of the word ""challenges"" suggests that the author views the requirements as potentially burdensome or problematic for companies, which aligns with a perspective that tends to prioritize the concerns of businesses and may be indicative of a free-market ideology.

3. ""They must disclose risks to operations from climate risk""
   - Stating this requirement in a straightforward manner implies the author acknowledges the reality of climate-related risks, which can be associated with an environmental or progressive ideology that advocates for corporate transparency and accountability.

4. ""incorrect reporting of information in your financial report is actionable by shareholders""
   - The emphasis on the legal consequences ('actionable') reflects a concern for shareholder rights and corporate governance, which can be associated with an ideology that values investor protections and market integrity.

5. ""failing to report 'material' information because you determined it to be 'immaterial' is also actionable""
   - This highlights the importance of materiality in financial reporting, suggesting an alignment with ideologies that support strict regulatory compliance and ethical business practices.

6. ""just be asking for a lawsuit""
   - This phrasing indicates a belief that litigation is a significant tool for ensuring compliance and a mechanism for accountability, hinting at a viewpoint that supports the use of legal means to uphold environmental disclosure standards.

7. ""It is also likely to force them to disclose where they are using offsets — which also makes the offsets being used subject to scrutiny.""
   - The language here ('force' and 'subject to scrutiny') suggests not just reporting requirements but a pressure to reveal potentially controversial practices. This aligns with a viewpoint that is in favor of transparency and against potential greenwashing by corporations.

8. ""This may be of real value (or it could get completely watered down and washed away).""
   - The parenthetical caveat expresses a concern that regulatory measures might not meet their potential due to dilution or disempowerment, hinting at a perspective wary of regulatory failure or compromise due to external pressures, likely from powerful business interests.

Overall, the article appears to combine an acknowledgement of the importance of climate-related disclosures and a concern for comprehensive corporate transparency with a caution about the potential challenges such measures face. This suggests a moderate viewpoint that values both environmental accountability and economic practicality."
dailykos,Economy,"The latest inflation report says that prices rose 7.5 percent over the past year, the highest inflation rate in 30 years. And according to the corporate media, it's all because of Joe Biden and government spending. In fact, one of the biggest drivers of inflation is something the mainstream media never talks about at all: the outsized power of corporations. Just two companies, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, dominate the market for household paper products like diapers and toilet paper. Four large meat-processing conglomerates control the prices of beef, pork, and poultry. And don't get me started on Amazon and Walmart. These companies aren't raising prices because they have to. They're raising prices because they can. But the American people aren't hearing any of this, and that's a big, big problem. Because if the voters don't get the real story about monopolistic power and what's causing inflation, they won't know what solutions to demand from their elected officials. Worse yet, they just might end up rewarding the very corporations responsible for the problem by electing a Republican majority in Congress—whose corporate campaign donations ensure they won't break up corporate monopoly power. If markets were truly competitive, companies would need to keep their prices down in order to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. But greedy corporations are raising prices even as they rake in record profits. How can this be? The answer is that they have so much market power they can artificially drive up prices with impunity. Again: The lion's share of the market for toilet paper is controlled by just two companies: P&G and Kimberly-Clark. So last April, when they jacked up prices, we had no choice but to pay up. Or consider another consumer product duopoly—PepsiCo (the parent company of Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, Tropicana, and other brands), and Coca-Cola. In April, PepsiCo announced it was increasing prices. Then, just like clockwork, its only major competitor announced similar price hikes. In every case, the companies blamed higher costs on labor, freight, and raw materials. But in every case, these companies were also recording record profits, and their CEOs were raking it in. In other words, they're lying to you. They're using ""inflation"" as an excuse to price gouge and fatten compensation packages for their executives. Here's the thing. Turning dry economic concepts into social media content that that people (including young folks) will actually watch is a huge task! But the brilliant creative team at Inequality Media Civic Action has figured it out—and they continue to exceed my expectations. Plus, we've built an online audience of more than 6.5 million followers, including a surprisingly large number of conservatives and independents. So we can reach the people we need, even as viewing habits change and attention spans get shorter, with a small team on a shoestring budget.","The latest inflation report indicates that over the past year, prices increased by 7.5 percent, marking the highest inflation rate observed in 30 years. While some point to government spending, others highlight different contributing factors. One element emerging in discussions is the influence of market concentration in key industries. For example, two companies, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, hold significant share in the market for household paper goods, and a small number of meat-processing companies set the prices for beef, pork, and poultry. Major retailers such as Amazon and Walmart also play a substantial role in the retail market.

Prices in these sectors are on the rise, and while some argue that this is due to increased costs on materials, labor, or freight, financial data reveals that these corporations are concurrently posting high profits, and executive compensations remain robust. Market dynamics such as these prompt a closer scrutiny on how prices are set and the factors influencing them.

When considering the competitive landscape, the expectation is for companies to maintain or lower prices to attract customers. However, certain market leaders have increased prices, raising questions about the competitive pressures they are facing, and whether there are broader market forces at play.

Taking consumer goods as an example, when PepsiCo announced price increases, Coca-Cola followed suit soon after. This parallel move has led to further analysis of market behaviors, particularly in industries where few companies hold major market share. In these cases, some have noted that substantial profits and high executive pay seem contradictory to claims that price increases were solely necessitated by rising costs.

Public discourse around these issues is vital, as it guides citizens in forming opinions and making decisions at the polls that reflect their views on market dynamics and economic policy. Access to a range of perspectives can aid voters in understanding the complex factors contributing to inflation and the potential steps that might be taken to address it.

Communicating intricate economic concepts in an engaging way is challenging but imperative. Groups such as Inequality Media Civic Action are working to present these topics through social media in an accessible format, reaching out to diverse audiences of millions, including those whose viewing habits are evolving and who span the political spectrum, illustrating that these economic discussions are of broad public interest.","1. ""And according to the corporate media, it's all because of Joe Biden and government spending.""
   - This phrase suggests a bias against what the article terms ""corporate media,"" implying they unfairly blame President Joe Biden and government policies for inflation. The underlying ideology here is one that is critical of mainstream media narratives and possibly supportive of the Biden administration.

2. ""the outsized power of corporations""
   - The use of ""outsized power"" indicates a viewpoint that is suspicious or critical of corporate influence and monopolistic practices, suggesting an ideology that favors antitrust regulation and market competition.

3. ""These companies aren't raising prices because they have to. They're raising prices because they can.""
   - This direct accusation implies that corporations are exploiting their market power for profit rather than responding to economic necessity. This reflects a populist ideology that is critical of corporate greed.

4. ""rewarding the very corporations responsible for the problem by electing a Republican majority in Congress""
   - The association of corporate interests with the election of a Republican majority suggests a political bias, with the underlying ideology likely being more aligned with the Democratic Party or left-leaning policies, which are perceived as less inclined to support corporate monopoly power.

5. ""greedy corporations""
   - Labeling corporations as ""greedy"" is a judgmental term that reveals a leftist or progressive stance, critical of capitalism in its current form, and supports the narrative that economic inequality is driven by corporate greed.

6. ""artificially drive up prices with impunity""
   - The use of ""artificially"" and ""with impunity"" suggests that corporations are manipulating the market and are unchecked by regulation or competition, implying an ideological standpoint favoring increased market regulation.

7. ""They're using 'inflation' as an excuse to price gouge""
   - Accusing companies of using inflation as a cover for exploitative pricing practices indicates a belief that not all price increases can be attributed to legitimate economic pressures. This reflects an anti-corporate ideology.

8. ""brilliant creative team at Inequality Media Civic Action""
   - Praising the ""Inequality Media Civic Action"" suggests approval of their mission and methods, indicating support for progressive advocacy and messaging against economic inequality.

9. ""a surprisingly large number of conservatives and independents""
   - Mentioning the audience includes conservatives and independents may be intended to suggest bipartisanship or outreach beyond traditional progressive circles, potentially indicating a strategy to build broader support for an anti-monopoly and anti-corporate concentration agenda.

Overall, the language and rhetoric in the article suggests a progressive or left-leaning political ideology that is skeptical of mainstream media narratives, critical of corporate power and influence, and supportive of antitrust measures and economic policies that counteract corporate overreach and promote market competition."
dailykos,Economy,"CNN and other outlets are reporting that former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud case against him because the prosecutors are “politically motivated” and are out to get him and Trump. Weisselberg also argues that the city and state of New York have no jurisdiction over federal income tax matters. And the icing on the cake is that Weisselberg was granted immunity for his grand jury testimony against Michael Cohen, so prosecutors cannot use anything he said in his grand jury testimony.

Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud indictment against him, saying it violates the immunity he was given in the federal investigation into Michael Cohen, a former personal attorney to former President Donald Trump, and that certain charges fall outside of the statute of limitations. Weisselberg’s attorneys also argued in the 162-page brief that the Manhattan district attorney and New York attorney general have targeted Trump, Weisselberg and the Trump Organization. In the filing, his attorneys argue that New York authorities were politically motivated in pursuing the indictment last summer charging them with a 15-year tax fraud scheme. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty. The motion to dismiss comes as the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office continues to investigate the Trump Organization and its executives about the accuracy of financial statements provided to lenders, insurers and others. Last week, a New York judge ruled that Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump need to testify in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into the Trump Organization’s finances. Trumps attorneys have vowed to appeal. In arguing for the dismissal, Weisselberg’s lawyers write, “Mr. Weisselberg’s federal grand jury testimony forged the first link in the chain of evidence that culminated in this Indictment.” The lawyers argued that Cohen had embarked on a campaign driven by “vengeance” against Weisselberg and cooperated extensively with the district attorney’s office, suggesting the internal nickname for the investigation is “fixer,” a nod to Cohen’s self-proclaimed title.

First up, I’d like to know what judge is considering Weisselberg’s petition to have all charges dismissed. I assume it is a judge from New York, considering The Trump Organization is getting hit from both the Manhattan DA and the New York State Attorney General Tish James. And this sounds like a typical legal stalling tactic from Trump, and Weisselberg is Trump’s Sith apprentice.

But I had wondered what was going through Weisselberg’s head when it came to the charges arrayed against him. Remember when people thought that Weisselberg would flip? I even thought he would. He’s an old guy, and why should he go to prison for Trump?

However, Weisselberg is determined to tough this out. I’m just guessing here, but I think that Weisselberg has picked up a bunch of tricks from Donald Trump over his decades of service to the Dark Lord. Weisselberg has witnessed Trump evade legal jams from the beginning of time, so why couldn’t Weisselberg do the same?

And this petition has all the gall of a Trump acolyte.
• Throw all kinds of “legal” arguments at the wall to see which one sticks.
• Emphasize “You cannot touch be because of matter X!”
• And be dishonest during the entire process.

Here is where that last point comes in:

CNN previously reported that federal prosecutors suspected Weisselberg was not entirely truthful during his grand jury testimony and considered charging him with perjury. Weisselberg was granted partial immunity for his testimony about hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal crimes, including campaign finance charges… Weisselberg’s attorneys also asked the judge to suppress statements Weisselberg had made while he was in custody for eight hours the morning he surrendered to face the charges. While in custody, Weisselberg made statements about living in Manhattan and the high cost of schooling – issues at the heart of the indictment. His attorneys say those statements were compelled in violation of his constitutional rights.

I don’t know how much evidence the prosecutors have on Weisselberg, but unless he finds a really corrupt judge, I think his petition for dismissal will be rejected. There is a paper trial from what I have read. But no matter, the point is to stall and throw as much sand as possible into the slow wheels of the justice system.

As to why Weisselberg has resurfaced now, this may have something to do with it:

This is a “limited deposition,” but the Trump lawyers were having a hissy fit that the judge is compelling Weisselberg to cough up any knowledge he has about the Trump Inauguration Committee. This tends to get forgotten, but the DC Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against the Trump Inauguration Committee for ripping people off.

Anyway, I expect Weisselberg will lie or plead the Fifth during this deposition.

And the beat goes on.","Allen Weisselberg, the former Chief Financial Officer of the Trump Organization, has submitted a request for the dismissal of the tax fraud case against him. In his defense, Weisselberg has pointed toward the immunity he received during the federal investigation into Michael Cohen, a former attorney for President Donald Trump. His legal team contends that this immunity should extend to the current proceedings, and that some charges may be precluded by the statute of limitations.

The legal team also presented an argument that the actions of the Manhattan District Attorney and the New York Attorney General in bringing forth the indictment may have been selective, stating that the timing and focus of the charges could be seen as exceptional. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have entered not guilty pleas.

The motion to dismiss coincides with ongoing inquiries by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office into the Trump Organization's financial representations to lenders, insurers, and other entities. Recently, a New York judge ordered Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., and daughter Ivanka Trump to provide sworn testimony in a separate civil investigation into the organization's financial dealings. The Trump family's legal team has indicated plans to challenge this ruling.

Additionally, Weisselberg's lawyers have raised concerns about the admissibility of certain statements made by their client under custody. They assert his constitutional rights may have been violated when he was compelled to speak on matters crucial to the indictment, such as his residence in Manhattan and related expenses.

While Weisselberg's petition seeks to address multiple legal points for dismissal, it remains to be seen how the judge will rule on this matter. Prosecutors have previously investigated whether Weisselberg fully disclosed all pertinent information during his testimony and considered whether perjury charges were appropriate in the context of statements about payments made to Stormy Daniels.

The issue of Weisselberg's possible testimony also comes into play in a separate matter involving a deposition related to the Trump Inauguration Committee. The Committee is the subject of a lawsuit by the Washington D.C. Attorney General concerning the use of funds.

As the case progresses, the outcomes of these legal challenges will provide further developments in the situation surrounding Weisselberg and the Trump Organization.","1. ""CNN and other outlets are reporting that former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud case against him because the prosecutors are 'politically motivated' and are out to get him and Trump.""
   - This quote uses the phrase ""politically motivated"" and the suggestion that the prosecutors are ""out to get"" Weisselberg and Trump, a framing that suggests a bias towards portraying the prosecution as engaging in a partisan or unfair pursuit rather than legitimate legal action. This type of language is common in rhetoric that seeks to undermine the credibility of legal challenges by framing them as driven by political vendettas rather than evidence.

2. ""And the icing on the cake is that Weisselberg was granted immunity for his grand jury testimony against Michael Cohen, so prosecutors cannot use anything he said in his grand jury testimony.""
   - The phrase ""icing on the cake"" implies a kind of unwarranted or excessive benefit or advantage, with a slightly sarcastic tone that suggests disbelief or scorn towards Weisselberg's claim of immunity. This language choice indicates a viewpoint that prosecutors are being overly hampered or that Weisselberg is attempting to exploit legal technicalities, a perspective more closely aligned with a belief in legal accountability and skepticism towards the defense's tactics.

3. ""And this sounds like a typical legal stalling tactic from Trump, and Weisselberg is Trump’s Sith apprentice.""
   - Describing Weisselberg as Trump's ""Sith apprentice"" employs a pop culture reference to the ""Star Wars"" franchise villains, which conveys a very strong negative connotation and suggests an ideological stance that is highly critical of both Trump and Weisselberg. This statement indicates a bias that portrays their actions as not only negative but wielding power in a deceptive or malevolent way.

4. ""Weisselberg has witnessed Trump evade legal jams from the beginning of time, so why couldn’t Weisselberg do the same?""
   - The use of the phrase ""from the beginning of time"" is hyperbolic and indicates a belief that Trump's ability to avoid legal consequences is almost legendary, suggesting a long pattern of such behavior. This conveys an attitude of skepticism about the fairness of the legal system when it comes to powerful individuals, implying an ideology that favors strict accountability and lacks sympathy for Weisselberg's situation.

5. ""Throw all kinds of 'legal' arguments at the wall to see which one sticks.""
   - The quotes around ""legal"" serve to question the legitimacy of the arguments put forward, painting them as potentially spurious or disingenuous. It implies a critical view of legal maneuvering and could indicate a belief that justice should be straightforward rather than subject to such tactics, a stance often taken by ideologies that prioritize rule of law over legal technicalities.

6. ""But no matter, the point is to stall and throw as much sand as possible into the slow wheels of the justice system.""
   - This statement critiques the defense's strategy of delaying and complicating the legal process, suggesting a viewpoint that such actions are obstructive and detrimental to the proper functioning of justice. The imagery of ""throw[ing] as much sand as possible into the slow wheels of the justice system"" evokes a sense of frustration and aligns with political ideologies that advocate for efficient and unobstructed judicial proceedings.

7. ""This tends to get forgotten, but the DC Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against the Trump Inauguration Committee for ripping people off.""
   - The language used here, specifically the term ""ripping people off,"" suggests a bias against the Trump Inauguration Committee, framing them as definitively guilty of fraudulent or unethical behavior. The phrase indicates an ideological perspective that is predisposed towards viewing Trump-associated entities with suspicion and assumes wrongdoing without presenting a neutral stance.

8. ""I expect Weisselberg will lie or plead the Fifth during this deposition.""
   - This expectation of lying or pleading the Fifth Amendment presumes an anticipation of dishonesty or evasion of testimony on the part of Weisselberg, portraying him as untrustworthy. Such an assertion reveals a bias that expects guilty behavior and implies an ideology that assumes corruption and the need for legal intervention to extract the truth.
   
The language and rhetoric of this article cumulatively suggest an underlying political ideology that is highly critical of Trump, Weisselberg, and their legal strategies. The article contains a skepticism towards the motivations behind their defense, a distrust of their past conduct, and a belief in the importance of legal accountability, all of which orient the reader against the subjects' purported tactics and character."
dailykos,Election,"Well, it’s football season, so we’ll go there metaphorically. Half time (the mid-terms) for the Biden Administration is nearly here. It’s time to look at the stats for team blue.

Now Regular Joe (as opposed to Broad Way Joe) has been at this game since 1970 when he was elected to the New Castle County Council. At age 29 he was elected to the United States Senate. One of the youngest ever elected to the most exclusive club on this planet. Served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a dozen years; then the Judiciary Committee from 1987 till 1995. He ran to quarter back the Executive Branch twice… in 1987 and again in 1995. Failed both times. Then in 2007 he chose to run with one Barack Obama. As his backup. He was at this moment the fourth senior sitting senator. He gave that up to switch leagues from the legislative branch to the executive branch: if you please. As the back up! There is an old saw that goes something like this, “There once were two brothers: one became a missionary who went to deepest darkest Africa and the other became Vice President and neither were heard from again!” Not so here!

They ran: they won. Twice. The bromance began then, still exists and is stronger today. For eight years Joe served as the backup. The bomb, their major score, was the passage of The Affordable Care Act, aka Obama Care. It passed the senate 60-39. Just enough for passage. Thank you, darlin’ Arlen Specter, (D? Pa.) Never had a single bullet gone so far! Oh yeah, they saved the auto industry too. No trick play that.

And Joe stepped off the field. The personal pain and grief of losing a son to brain cancer was consuming...debilitating. After a season off the field, he decided to run again for quarter back of the Executive Branch. After a slow start in the primaries, he won going away, as they say. The ‘W’ in the Presidential Election was most respectable and gratifying.

At the start of the first half of our current game Regular Joe quarter backed using the bipartisan play book. The fans howled. Team red doesn’t play by those rules they said. And they were right. But using a play book and knowing the rules of the game are two very different things. Joe knows the rule book front to back. He called the 50 plus one rule for budget plays in the senate for his American Rescue Plan and Kamala ran it in. (First woman backup QB...a woman of color to boot... more points for the blue team) The 1.9 trillion $ bill was signed on 3/11/21. Major score!

Infrastructure Week. That was a punch line during the previous four-year game. Joe’s Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Bill passed the senate 69/30. Guess the red team likes bridges that aren’t ready to fall down or already have and roads that don’t rattle your fillings. And the fans grumbled that yeah that one was bipartisan. So what!

The next major score was the Chip and Science Act. Ain’t talking potato chips here fans. And, stunningly, this was passed in the senate 64-33. A bipartisan vote. Not the wonder of the age...just a contender. Signed into law 8/9/22...I believe.

Now for the IRA. No, not your retirement plan fan. The Inflation Reduction Act is what I’m talking’bout. Joe again called the 50 plus rule in the senate. And again, Kamala ran it in. Passed 51/50. In a hundred-member body. Check the rule book. Csonka got nothin’ on Kamala. The best part of this play, besides the passage of the bill, is the fact that the red team's senate middle linebacker aka Senate Minority leader Mitch Mcconnell, got blind-sided on the play. The old turtle found himself sitttin’ on a fence post with his legs waving in the air and he knows exactly who put him there. Just the look on his face….

So, half time is approaching, and team blue has run up the score pretty good. Joe gets ready for the second half with an inspirational speech to his team and fans in front of the building in Philly where the founders of this game wrote down the rules, aka The Constitution of the United Staes of America. Some in the stands complained about the red background. If you think that was an unforced error, you don’t know Joe. Isn’t red a sign of danger? The two Marines were a nice touch too A reminder, they protect The President of the United States. And their standing post added a just right aggressive touch, ordered by the Commander in Chief.

Joe told us about the new play book he would use in the second half. The bipartisan playbook put aside for the moment. Using it he got what he could from team red (a lot). When he could get nothing more, he changed the play book and... Mitch meets fence post. Divide and conquer the red team. Why yes, there are good people on the red team. Maybe most of the team. Bipartisan votes prove that. But some members of the red team are semi! A danger to the greatest game ever invented. Their fans are upset. Good. Emotional and upset people make mistakes. Make bad calls.

I don’t know how the second half will play out but we gonna find out. Well Regular Joe isn’t the goat but he will make the hall of fame next to such greats as the FDR/ Truman team. They played for 20 years and changed the world. LBJ comes to mind, if only for his domestic game. You look at Joe and what do you see? Nearing 80 there ain’t much left physically. Just bone, muscle and sinew. But, after a lifetime of studying and learning and playing the greatest game ever, this is his sublime moment!","The football season serves as a good parallel for the political cycle, and as we approach the midway point, it's an opportune moment to assess the actions of the current administration.

Joe Biden's political career began in 1970 with his election to the New Castle County Council and subsequent election to the U.S. Senate at 29, making him one of the youngest ever to join that body. His service included time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Judiciary Committee. He made two bids for the presidency in 1987 and 1995, though without success. In 2007, he joined forces with Barack Obama as the vice-presidential candidate and served in that capacity for two terms, during which the Affordable Care Act was passed and the auto industry was rescued.

After a period away from politics due to personal loss, Biden re-entered the presidential race, eventually securing the Democratic nomination and winning the presidency. Early in his term, he embraced bipartisan efforts, leading to the passing of significant legislation, including the American Rescue Plan, the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Bill, and the CHIPS and Science Act, all of which had varying levels of bipartisan support.

The Inflation Reduction Act was another legislative achievement, passed using budget reconciliation. It aims to address economic challenges and has been noted for the procedural tactics used to secure its passage.

While preparing for the next phase, the administration has indicated a shift in strategy, acknowledging the value of bipartisan achievements while also recognizing the need for different approaches depending on the political landscape.

The administration has navigated various challenges and scored legislative victories. While time will tell how the remainder of the term will unfold, the political and legislative record thus far indicates a mix of strategies and accomplishments that reflect an evolving approach to governance. Biden has drawn upon his extensive experience as he executes his duties in the presidential office.","This article appears to contain language and rhetoric supportive of a left-leaning, Democratic political ideology. Here are specific examples:

1. ""Regular Joe (as opposed to Broad Way Joe)"" - This nickname suggests a down-to-earth persona for President Biden, contrasting him with the flashy ""Broad Way Joe"" Namath, a football star. It is a framing technique to present Biden as relatable to the average American.

2. ""One of the youngest ever elected to the most exclusive club on this planet."" – The phrasing emphasizes Joe Biden's accomplishments and early success, casting him positively and as a significant figure in the political scene.

3. ""Thank you, darlin' Arlen Specter, (D? Pa.)"" – The use of the word ""darling"" followed by a question mark next to the party affiliation suggests a jesting appreciation for the political maneuvering that contributed to passing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, painting it as a crafty and clever win for the Democratic agenda.

4. ""The bomb, their major score, was the passage of The Affordable Care Act, aka Obama Care."" - Here, the term ""the bomb"" is military slang for a huge success. The phrasing ""major score"" further celebrates the ACA's passage as a significant victory, implying it has had a positive impact and that the writer aligns with the view that the ACA is a beneficial policy.

5. ""Joe knows the rule book front to back."" – This phrase suggests deep experience and implies wisdom and competence in navigating political processes, framing Biden as a seasoned and knowledgeable leader who is adept at his role.

6. ""First woman backup QB...a woman of color to boot... more points for the blue team"" – This aligns Kamala Harris's role and her identity as a woman of color with progress and achievement for the Democratic Party, suggesting that inclusivity and representation are victories to be celebrated.

7. ""And the fans grumbled that yeah that one was bipartisan. So what!"" – The dismissal of grumbling fans downplays criticism and reinforces the point that bipartisan achievements are to be valued, indicating a belief in the importance of crossing party lines for the greater good.

8. ""The best part of this play…is the fact that the red team's senate middle linebacker aka Senate Minority leader Mitch Mcconnell, got blind-sided"" – This passage uses the metaphor of a surprising football play to celebrate a political maneuver seen as outsmarting a leading Republican, which indicates a partisan attitude favoring Democrat political strategy.

9. ""Divide and conquer the red team."" – The language here suggests a strategic approach rooted in warfare or competition, indicating approval of aggressive political strategies against the Republican Party (the red team).

10. ""Some in the stands complained about the red background. If you think that was an unforced error, you don’t know Joe."" – This addresses criticism from the opposite political spectrum. The acknowledgment of the opposition's critique followed by a confident rebuttal shows a bias in favor of the Democratic narrative and a dismissal of Republican complaints.

11. ""Well Regular Joe isn’t the goat but he will make the hall of fame next to such greats as the FDR/ Truman team."" – This passage likens Biden to past Democratic Presidents known for significant accomplishments, suggesting a legacy of impactful governance and placing him favorably within a historical context of Democratic leaders.

The overall tone and presentation of the article clearly suggest a positively biased view of President Biden and Democratic achievements while framing Republican opposition as either overcome obstacles or misguided critics."
dailykos,Election,"It is illogical that anyone could feel that saving the Filibuster is more important than saving our right to vote, our democracy & the constitution. That is why I have a couple questions for you both. First: You do know that Majority leader, McConnell stole the SCOTUS seat from President Obama & Democrats in 2016, after which he ditched the Filibuster in 2017 so Republicans could approve Neal Gorsich for SCOTUS with only 51 votes, don’t you and that isn’t all. Ultimately as luck would have it the Republicans gained three SCOTUS seats in four years.

If you know all this stuff already, then why is it okay for Republicans to modify the Filibuster but not your own party, the Democrats? They are your party, aren’t they? It seems you are favoring the opposition party, Republicans over your own party.

For starters in today’s divided country and parties it is next to impossible to get 60 votes to overcome the Filibuster since no one party has had sixty senators since 1980 — 42 years.

Should you get your way, and many Democrats lose the right to vote or Republicans over-ride the vote which makes it impossible for Democrats to compete, it will be your fault and realistically since the Republicans control the elections why would they bother with the Filibuster at all anymore. The answer is they wouldn’t. They’d just deep six the Filibuster and who’s going to stop them? Thanks to you two, Democrats would have no weapons to fight them off anymore.

So, you see, instead of saving the filibuster you are hastening its demise.","The discussion surrounding the role of the filibuster in American politics has become a prominent issue, especially in light of recent events involving Supreme Court appointments and legislative process. In 2016, there was significant debate following the decision not to hold hearings for a Supreme Court nominee during President Obama's last year in office, which was a decision led by Majority Leader McConnell. The subsequent nomination and confirmation of Justice Gorsuch in 2017 took place after changes to the filibuster rules, which allowed for a simple majority vote for Supreme Court confirmations instead of the previous 60-vote threshold.

There are questions regarding the consistency of filibuster rule application and whether one party benefits from its modification more than another. It is observed that no political party has held a supermajority of 60 senators for several decades, which under current rules could make passing significant legislation challenging without bipartisan support.

The impact of election laws and voting rights on the political competitiveness of both parties has also been a topic of discussion. The relationship between election administration and the ability to enact or resist changes to the filibuster — and how these dynamics could affect the political landscape — are part of the broader conversation on how best to ensure a fair and functional democratic system.

In this environment, the evolution of the filibuster and its potential future as a legislative tool remains a subject of debate, with opinions varying on the best path forward to address the challenges posed by the current political climate.","The provided article appears to criticize individuals who are prioritizing the preservation of the filibuster over voting rights and democratic principles, with a particular emphasis on the actions and perceived hypocrisy of the Republican Party in relation to the filibuster. The language and rhetoric present a specific political ideology — seemingly leaning toward a Progressive or Democrat viewpoint.

1. ""It is illogical that anyone could feel that saving the Filibuster is more important than saving our right to vote, our democracy & the constitution.""
   - This sentence suggests a viewpoint that places a high value on democratic processes and civil rights, indicating a progressive or democrat-leaning ideology. It represents the rights to vote and democratic structures as paramount, framing the maintenance of the filibuster as an opposition to these values.

2. ""Majority leader, McConnell stole the SCOTUS seat from President Obama & Democrats in 2016...he ditched the Filibuster in 2017 so Republicans could approve Neal Gorsuch for SCOTUS with only 51 votes.""
   - The use of the word ""stole"" conveys a strong bias, suggesting that the Republican actions regarding the Supreme Court vacancy were illegitimate or unethical. Additionally, describing McConnell's actions as ""ditching"" the filibuster implies a disdain for the tactic used, indicative of a viewpoint that likely aligns with Democrat criticisms.

3. ""why is it okay for Republicans to modify the Filibuster but not your own party, the Democrats? They are your party, aren’t they?""
   - This passage implies a bias towards Democrat perspectives, questioning the perceived double standards between the two parties. It also assumes allegiance to the Democratic Party, reinforcing the article's leaning.

4. ""in today’s divided country and parties it is next to impossible to get 60 votes to overcome the Filibuster...""
   - The statement emphasizes the political polarization in the United States, a viewpoint that might align with progressive criticisms regarding the efficacy of bipartisan cooperation.

5. ""many Democrats lose the right to vote or Republicans over-ride the vote which makes it impossible for Democrats to compete...""
   - Here, the language indicates a concern for voter rights and a fair democratic process, which is commonly a progressive or Democratic issue. It presents Republicans as potentially exploiting rules to suppress the Democratic vote, which is a clear indication of bias.

6. ""why would they bother with the Filibuster at all anymore. The answer is they wouldn’t. They’d just deep six the filibuster...""
   - The phrase ""deep six"" is informal and suggests a disregard or elimination of the filibuster. The rhetorical question and the predicted outcome indicate a belief that Republican control of electoral processes could result in a more one-sided political landscape.

7. ""Democrats would have no weapons to fight them off anymore.""
   - This metaphor places the political struggle in combative terms, which suggests an adversarial viewpoint consistent with partisan politics, particularly from a Democrat perspective. It implies a zero-sum game and the need for political tools to counteract the opposition.

8. ""So, you see, instead of saving the filibuster you are hastening its demise.""
   - The conclusion uses a tone of revelation to persuade the reader that the actions aimed at preserving the filibuster are, ironically, leading to its end. This suggests a view that the preservation efforts are shortsighted and counterproductive to the interests of the Democratic Party and democratic principles more broadly.

Overall, the language indicates a bias against Republican strategies regarding the filibuster and a fear that such strategies will undermine democratic principles. It advocates for the interests of the Democratic Party and criticizes perceived hypocrisy and unfair practices."
dailykos,Immigration,"Vladimir Putin may be a lot of things but one thing that is entirely true is that he is reacting just as some pretty smart diplomats predicted more than 20 years ago.

To set the table for this piece, it’s important to remember a few things about Russia:

First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character. This attitude has been prevalent since the days of the tsars. It is good to remember that as ham-fisted as Russia’s actions at home and abroad can be, it is still the country which has given is incredible cultural contributions, from Tolstoy to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff to Kandinsky and Nijinsky. The list is endless. Yet, it has been—arguably—relatively isolated for centuries.

Second, Russia has been invaded twice in modern times—once by Napoleon and once by Hitler—with absolutely catastrophic consequences for the Russian people, not to mention the invaders.

Third, the soil of central and eastern Europe have absorbed more blood from war than any other part of that continent. Shifting borders from the 16th century onward, among European tribes, nations, and religions have been a regular occurrence in the part of the world.

George Kennan, once described as the smartest modern diplomat we’ve ever had, and the main architect of the 40-year Soviet containment policy during the Truman administration, knew something about Russia.

Kennan knew that every Russian leader understood that Russia’s “neurotic” view of the West was also fed by a series of autocrats who needed conflict as a justification for their rule, the most important of whom was Josef Stalin. As it relates to the present invasion of Ukraine, Kennan’s policy of containment, which was official policy of the Western nations from the 1950’s to the final collapse of the USSR in the 1990’s seems to have been manifestly successful.

In 1997 Kennan, at the age of 93, published and opinion piece in the New York Times advocating for admitting or extending an invitation to former Soviet clients to join NATO. NATO members were keen to bring the Baltic states, Poland and Romania as well as others into the alliance.

NATO had even floated the possibility of Russia itself joining NATO (which went nowhere fast!). Kennan pointed out that here was a newly minted “democratic” Russia, emerging from 70 years of totalitarianism, unsure of itself, it total disarray economically and militarily, its gutted army having just backed out of Afghanistan, its fleet devastated and tied up in port. And now comes NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of the WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit, sharing a border with Mother Russia. The former satellites, themselves afraid of being overrun by the Russian bear once again, quickly jumped on the NATO bus.

In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe and who, thanks for Boris Yeltsin, found himself holding the keys to the Russian kingdom, Over the last 20 years has snuffed out the light of liberty in exchange for the reestablishment of the kind of absolute order he can personally control. And he sees NATO on his front doorstep; and worse, the possibility of a Ukraine NATO member just a few hundred miles from Moscow. Finally, Putin now has his pretext for reacquiring the former client—now members of NATO— states. NATO, he tells his people, is bent on destroying Mother Russia.

Will he move further west? Hard to tell. What is certain, though, is that Putin has taken a huge bite of the apple with Ukraine. Whether he can swallow it is yet to be decided. The same fears now are the same fears of yesteryear among Russia and her leaders. Once again, Putin, ever fearful of western encroachment and more importantly fearing a threat to his rule, has thrown down the gauntlet.","Vladimir Putin's response to the prevailing geopolitical landscape aligns with the assessments previously made by experienced diplomats, who have a long history of engagement with Russian affairs.

Understanding Russia's position requires acknowledging several historical factors. Russia is a nation with a strong sense of pride, and its role on the global stage has been a cornerstone of its national identity for centuries. Despite facing challenges both domestically and internationally, Russia has been a significant contributor to cultural advancements, with a legacy spanning literature, music, and the arts.

Historically, Russia has experienced invasions with severe repercussions, notably during the Napoleonic Wars and World War II. These experiences have shaped Russia's strategic outlook and heightened its focus on national security.

Throughout history, the shifting borders of Central and Eastern Europe have witnessed numerous conflicts and power dynamics, which have had a profound impact on the region.

George Kennan, a diplomat known for his expertise in Soviet affairs and his role in formulating the policy of Soviet containment under President Truman, had a comprehensive understanding of Russia. Kennan acknowledged the complex relationship between Russia and Western nations, further complicated by leadership styles and historical grievances.

When discussing the expansion of NATO in the late 1990s, Kennan shared his perspectives on the potential ramifications of inviting former Soviet territories into the alliance. The discourse around NATO's membership invitations to the Baltic states, Poland, and Romania, as well as the brief consideration of Russia's inclusion, were notable developments during this period of transformation.

The changes in post-Soviet Russia, coupled with economic and military challenges, were significant factors during NATO’s consideration of membership expansion. This decision was met with varying degrees of enthusiasm from the countries involved, many of whom sought the security assurances provided by the alliance.

Entering the political arena, Putin, who has been critical of the loss of the Soviet Union’s status, assumed leadership following Boris Yeltsin’s tenure. Throughout his time in office, Putin has focused on consolidating control and addressing security concerns, particularly those associated with NATO's presence in regions bordering Russia. The prospect of Ukraine joining NATO has been a particular point of focus, viewed as a direct challenge to Russia's strategic interests.

As Putin navigates these complex geopolitical dynamics, the implications of Russia's actions in Ukraine and its effect on international relations remain a topic of discussion. Putin's strategy reflects both historical continuity and the current geopolitical realities that Russia seeks to engage with.","The language and rhetoric in the provided article indeed convey certain biases and viewpoints, which reflect an underlying political ideology. Here are some examples, numbered and analyzed as requested:

1. ""Vladimir Putin may be a lot of things but one thing that is entirely true is that he is reacting just as some pretty smart diplomats predicted more than 20 years ago.""
   - This phrase suggests a viewpoint that Putin's actions are not entirely unforeseen or irrational but are in line with historical analyses and predictions by respected figures (i.e., ""smart diplomats""). This can imply a deterministic or realist view of international relations, where actions are seen as reactions to a historical or strategic context.

2. ""First, it is a fiercely proud nation.""
   - Describing Russia as ""fiercely proud"" frames the country in a sympathetic light, emphasizing national pride as a driving force and a historically rooted characteristic. This language can suggest a respect for national sovereignty and understanding of behavior in the context of national identity, a perspective often associated with conservative or realist ideologies.

3. ""This attitude has been prevalent since the days of the tsars.""
   - By referencing the era of the tsars, the writer connects current Russian attitudes to a long tradition, implying a historical continuity in Russian behavior. This can be indicative of a viewpoint that regards present actions as deeply rooted in the past, justifying or at least contextualizing them within a broader sweep of history.

4. ""Russia’s 'neurotic' view of the West""
   - The use of ""neurotic"" to describe Russia's outlook could be interpreted as pejorative, suggesting an irrational or excessive distrust. However, considering the context of repeated invasions and conflicts, it also acknowledges historical reasons for such a view, balanced by the recognition of its potentially problematic nature.

5. ""the most important of whom was Josef Stalin.""
   - By singling out Stalin as a particularly significant autocrat, the writer connects current dynamics to a historically controversial and powerful figure. This might appeal to audiences who view Stalin’s rule as oppressive, thus implicitly criticizing autocratic tendencies in current Russian leadership.

6. ""NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit""
   - The term ""archenemy"" suggests a deep-seated and enduring rivalry, which could resonate with those who view the world in terms of long-term strategic blocs or alliances. This wording is suggestive of a Cold War-era mindset, which is often associated with conservative foreign policy circles.

7. ""afraid of being overrun by the Russian bear once again""
   - Evoking the image of Russia as a ""bear"" is a classic example of metaphor that implies a certain brutish strength and a predatory nature. This description can be seen as a bias that portrays Russia as a continuing threat, especially resonant with ideologies that favor strong defense postures against perceived aggressors.

8. ""Putin has taken a huge bite of the apple with Ukraine. Whether he can swallow it is yet to be decided.""
   - The writer uses the metaphor of biting and swallowing an apple as an analogy for territorial expansion and potential overextension. The tone here is cautionary, inviting the reader to question the legitimacy and sustainability of such actions. This kind of language suggests a critical stance towards what can be perceived as imperial overreach.

By using these phrases, the writer of the article conveys a viewpoint that is broadly skeptical of Russian actions and motives, understands these within a historical perspective, and recognizes the security concerns of neighboring states. The rhetoric aligns with a political ideology that combines elements of conservatism, realism, and perhaps liberal internationalism given the tacit endorsement of NATO expansion as a security measure for former Soviet states."
dailykos,Immigration,"I read the Colorado Springs Independent every week — free newspaper with an investigative reporting group that has oversized skills set (llok up the national journalism awards for their staff — impressive). This week they had a really important article here titled:

Charis College is a compound created by Andrew Wommack Ministries — some of you may heard of this one. It is a college that:

here is an emphasis at the college in training students to become political leaders, and the college teaches a version of Young Earth creationism, which is based on a literal interpretation of Genesis, and holds that Earth and all life on it were created in their current forms by the God of Abraham somewhere around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.

This has caused a little concern since Wommack has publicly:

said last April “as many people as we have in this school here, we ought to take over Woodland Park,” it did more than raise a few eyebrows — particularly when he elaborated, saying “this county ought to be totally dominated by believers,” and, “We have enough people here in this school we could elect anybody we want.”

The article is a through look at the confluence of religion and politics in small town America where a national ministry can, in essence, coopt a town.

Woodland Park — the home of Charis — is about 19 miles downtown to downtown — probably closer to 10 miles border to border. El Paso County — home to both Colorado Springs and Woodland Park — is one of the epicenters of evangelical business, broadcasting, and politics.

read the Indy — free on line — and support them if you can. They do great work. This is an important story in the changing American political landscape.","Article:

The Colorado Springs Independent, a free newspaper, regularly features content from a team of reporters acknowledged for their excellence in journalism, which can be substantiated by observing their national journalism awards. A recent piece covered a story on Charis College, an educational institution founded by Andrew Wommack Ministries.

At Charis College, part of the curriculum involves educating students about leadership roles, potentially including political ones. The college also presents its perspective on Young Earth creationism, a viewpoint interpreting Genesis literally, purporting that the Earth and all life were created by the God of Abraham approximately 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.

Some commentary has emerged concerning the college, especially following statements by Andrew Wommack. In April, Wommack mentioned that the student body had the potential to influence the local governance of Woodland Park, citing the capability of electing preferred candidates to public office due to the size of the school´s population.

The story offers insights into the interactions between religious organizations and local politics in a small-town setting. It delves into how an influential ministry can shape a community, as seen in Woodland Park, located near Colorado Springs within El Paso County. This is a region known for its concentration of evangelical businesses, media, and political activities.

The Colorado Springs Independent is accessible online at no cost, and contributions to support their work are welcomed. Their coverage sheds light on stories that reflect on broader trends in the American political sphere.","In the provided article excerpt, several phrases and choices of language suggest a particular ideological bias or viewpoint, with a focus on the intersection of evangelical Christianity and politics. Here are some examples:

1. **""investigative reporting group that has oversized skills set""**
   - The description of the Colorado Springs Independent's reporting group with an ""oversized skills set"" implies admiration for the newspaper's investigative capabilities, suggesting an ideological bias towards valuing in-depth, investigative journalism.

2. **""a really important article""**
   - Referring to the article on Charis College as ""really important"" conveys a sense of urgency or significance, which may indicate the writer's perspective that the implications of the college's influence on politics are noteworthy and deserve public attention.

3. **""Charis College is a compound created by Andrew Wommack Ministries""**
   - The use of the word ""compound"" when describing Charis College could carry connotations of a closed, insular community with connotations of exclusivity or sectarianism, hinting at a critical view of the institution.

4. **""emphasis at the college in training students to become political leaders""**
   - This quote implies that the college has a direct aim to mold students into political figures, potentially raising concerns about the merging of religion and political power, indicating an ideological bias for the separation of these spheres.

5. **""a version of Young Earth creationism""**
   - The phrase ""a version of"" suggests there are multiple interpretations of Young Earth creationism and that what is taught at the college may not be mainstream or widely accepted, which might indicate skepticism towards that specific belief system.

6. **""we ought to take over Woodland Park""**
   - These words directly quoted from Wommack suggest a desire for political or social control of the area, which could be interpreted as an undemocratic or dominionist aspiration, highlighting a concern for the implications of such intentions.

7. **""this county ought to be totally dominated by believers""**
   - The use of ""dominated by believers"" could be seen as promoting a theocratic or exclusionary vision for the community, which could raise alarm from the perspective of those who favor religious pluralism and secular governance.

8. **""we could elect anybody we want""**
   - This statement implies a certain level of influence or power within the voting community that might not align with the democratic principle of fair representation, hinting at ideological bias towards safeguarding democratic processes and diversity in representation.

9. **""the confluence of religion and politics in small town America""**
   - Referring to the ""confluence of religion and politics"" suggests a convergence or merging of the two, often viewed critically by those supporting secular democracy, indicative of concern for potential overreach by religious groups into politics.

10. **""national ministry can, in essence, coopt a town""**
    - The use of ""coopt"" implies a takeover or appropriation, suggesting an unsolicited influence over public life by a religious organization, reflecting potential alarm over such influence.

11. **""the changing American political landscape""**
    - The phrase suggests significant shifts in the way religion and politics are interacting, which could be interpreted as either a positive or negative development, however, coupled with the overall tone of the article, it may point to a wary perspective on these changes.

The article seems to have an ideological slant towards secularism and a separation between church and state. It expresses concern over the influence of a religious institution in political affairs, and appears to endorse investigative reporting as a means to keep such influence in check."
dailykos,Police,"There are some basic qualifications for sitting on the Supreme Count of the United States (SCOTUS). These include:
• Not Lying or Committing Perjury in Confirmation Hearings:

Objectively speaking: Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett, have failed to show they are qualified to sit on the Court. As such, they NO LONGER meet the standards require to serve.

Article. III. SECTION. 1. States: “The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, … .”

The current make-up of the Court is:

The Constitution does not define what “Good Behaviour” is, but certainly; it includes a respect for the institution of the Court itself. The “leaked” Alito Draft opinion (Alito Draft) in the Dobbs v. Jackson case; reveals a fundamental disrespect for the Court and its precedents. Further, the opinion itself presents a FAILURE of even the most rudimentary basis of intellectual honesty. It displays an open contempt for the intelligence of the American people, by asserting that somehow, the Roe Court simply did not know what they were doing; and that this Court somehow has a better understanding of the law than any in the past. It defies all intellectual reasoning to say that Roe can be excised from the pantheon of judicial history, but that doing so will not undermine all other decisions. It is the ONLY TIME in the history of America, that the Court has proposed to “REMOVE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT” (as opposed to recognizing a previously undefine right, or expanding the understanding of rights to a new social circumstance). IT IS AKIN TO WHAT THE NAZI’S DID IN GERMANY IN DECLARING CERTAIN GROUPS ‘UNDESIRABLE’. The fundamental Constitutional right to access medical services to terminate a pregnancy HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR FIFTY YEARS. By July 1, 2022, that right will CEASE TO EXIST; as will every right that has been described under the “privacy” and Roe precedent.

Many times in our country’s history, the Court has been called upon to apply the fundamental nature of our democracy and freedom in terms more broadly construed than the existing precedent recognized. Many times, they refused (eg. Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856)). When they have, history has UNIVERSALLY panned the decisions as unprincipled and erroneously decided.

This case is different. Never has the Court acted to ELIMINATE an existing recognized Constitutional right, NEVER.

This is exactly what this Court is about to do; ELIMINATE a long-standing, recognized federal constitutional right. Further, their motivation for doing so is simply that THEY NOW HAVE A COURT WITH FIVE MEMBERS WILLING TO IGNOR THEIR OATHS AND DUTIES, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT ONLY HAS BASIS WITHIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL DOGMA. Nothing more. That is TYRANNY AT ITS WORST. More so, in that a vast majority of the public DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POSTION, DECISION, OR DOGMA.

We need to start calling this for what it REALLY IS: a JUDICIAL COUP; acting in operation to OVERTHROW the elected government, by judicial fiat. Upon this precedence, these five member could decide to declare the Pope the new president of the United States (and have in essence done just exactly that).

In addition, these justices have done exactly what they asserted (under oath) that they would not do: ignore the doctrine of Stare Decisis and overturn Roe.

I assert, that the Congress can and must, declare that these Justice NO LONGER SERVE UNDER THE TERMS OF “GOOD BEHAVIOUR”; and remove them from their positions.

The Constitution of the United States presents that the President must be Impeached (by The House of Representatives) and Convicted (by the Senate) to be removed from office (upon the qualifying offenses). It further presents that the individual body of the Congress, shall have the authority to determine the qualifications of its member to serve or continue serving. This process DOES NOT REQUIRE IMPEACHMENT (under the clear text of the constitution and its construction; “impeachment” is reserved for removal of the President, Vice-President, and the EXECUTIUVE BRANCH “OFFICERS”, as a necessity for removal from office. It is presented within the context of Article I (Legislative branch) and Article II (Executive branch): BUT IT IS NOT REPEATED under Article III (in regards to the Judicial branch). Thus, removal from office of a judicial branch member, requires only the CAUSE OF ACTION (violation of the “Good Behaviour” provision) and a majority vote of the Congress. As the Constitution provides the President the authority to nominate judges. This would suggest that any action to declare that a Judicial Officer is no longer qualified to hold a judicial position, because they are no longer compliant with the requirement of “Good Behaviour”, would likewise require the President to declare such to the Congress (stating the case against the Judicial Officer), in a Writ of Removal.

It is thus, that President Biden MUST IMMEDIATELTY DECLARE THESE FIVE JUSTICES NO LONGER FIT FOR OFFICE, AND REQUEST THAT CONGRESS VOTE TO REMOVE THEM DUE TO “BAD BEHAVIOUR”.","The qualifications for sitting on the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) include adherence to the laws and upholding the constitutional mandates during their tenure as justices.

Article III, Section 1, states that judges of both the Supreme and inferior courts ""shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,"" although the Constitution does not explicitly define ""Good Behaviour.""

The draft opinion authored by Justice Alito in the Dobbs v. Jackson case has sparked significant debate about the stability of long-standing legal precedents and the interpretation of constitutional rights. The draft, which raised questions regarding the continued recognition of a constitutional right that had been established for fifty years, led to widespread discussions on the Court's role in interpreting and potentially revising past decisions.

Historically, the Supreme Court has at times upheld and at other times reconsidered its precedents. The principle of Stare Decisis, which promotes legal stability by respecting past rulings, is an important feature of common law systems. However, the Supreme Court has also played a role in revising established legal frameworks in response to evolving societal values and understandings of justice.

The composition and decisions of the Supreme Court often reflect the dynamic nature of legal and constitutional interpretation and can prompt discussions on the judiciary's role in American democracy.

In considering the performance of justices and their alignment with the good behaviour clause, some may point to varied interpretations of this standard and the process by which a justice may be removed from office. The Constitution provides a mechanism for impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate for the President, while the removal of justices could potentially involve other procedures under congressional authority.

Any discussions on the qualifications and tenure of Supreme Court justices must carefully weigh constitutional intentions, legal norms, and the importance of an independent judiciary within the framework of American governance.","This excerpt certainly contains language and rhetoric that suggests a particular bias or viewpoint. Here are some instances that indicate the underlying ideology:

1. ""Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett, have failed to show they are qualified to sit on the Court.""
   - This claim implies a viewpoint that these Justices are not upholding what the author perceives as the standards or integrity expected of Supreme Court Justices, suggesting an ideological bias against the conservative orientation of the named justices.

2. ""The 'leaked' Alito Draft opinion... reveals a fundamental disrespect for the Court and its precedents.""
   - The language used here indicates a belief in the sanctity of Court precedents, reflected in the derogatory description of the draft opinion. This may suggest a liberal or progressive viewpoint that values established rulings like Roe v. Wade.

3. ""IT IS AKIN TO WHAT THE NAZI’S DID IN GERMANY IN DECLARING CERTAIN GROUPS ‘UNDESIRABLE’.""
   - The invocation of Nazi Germany is a profound example of reductio ad Hitlerum, a tactic often aimed at vilifying an opposing viewpoint by comparing it to the actions of Nazis. It reflects an extreme ideological position against the actions of the current Court majority.

4. ""That is TYRANNY AT ITS WORST.""
   - The use of the word ""tyranny"" implies extreme authoritarianism and abuse of power, suggesting that the author views the Court's potential actions as a complete disregard for democracy and the people's rights. This indicates a strong liberal or left-leaning bias.

5. ""a JUDICIAL COUP; acting in operation to OVERTHROW the elected government, by judicial fiat.""
   - The phrase ""judicial coup"" implies an unlawful or illegitimate takeover by the judiciary. This rhetoric reflects a perception that the Court is overstepping its authority, a view commonly held by those on the left in the context of conservative court decisions.

6. ""THEY NOW HAVE A COURT WITH FIVE MEMBERS WILLING TO IGNOR THEIR OATHS AND DUTIES, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT ONLY HAS BASIS WITHIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL DOGMA.""
   - Here, the author accuses the justices of being guided by personal belief rather than law. This suggests ideological bias, presuming the justices' motivations to be founded on personal rather than legal reasoning, typically a critique from the liberal side of the spectrum.

7. ""President Biden MUST IMMEDIATELTY DECLARE THESE FIVE JUSTICES NO LONGER FIT FOR OFFICE...""
   - This call to action for President Biden to remove these Justices reflects a belief in a more radical approach to addressing what the author perceives as a significant deviation from justice. The urgency and severity of the action proposed suggest a leftist or progressive ideology that demands substantial institutional change.

Overall, the language and rhetoric used in the article suggest a left-leaning, progressive ideology that is critical of the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court, particularly in relation to the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade and the handling of the Alito draft opinion leak. The author calls for dramatic measures to be taken in response to perceived violations of judicial conduct and respect for precedent, which reflects a strong bias towards maintaining established liberal court decisions."
dailykos,Police,"Ok, yeah yeah, it’ll never happen. I get the cynical ennui of it all. tfg (my own definition) aka traitortrump-mctraitorface, always skates. And Groundhog Day to boot. More snow and ice coming, and lindsey graham pipped a squeak and the sskkkrumpgop bus just bounced the diameter of a wanker quicker than a RINO can backpedal.

Still, the chance that some charging authority charges sskkkrump and he needs arresting is a non-zero variable needing political and multi-discipline analysis, because the possibilities of serious or catastrophic events related to a future indictment, apprehension, transportation, and incarceration of tfg are many. I believe that planning for some possible outcomes is being done now. If not, it should be initiated immediately, including feasibility analysis of options if he decides to resist arrest and publicly calls for assistance at his Florida residence, or an alternate location he flees to. Would he voluntarily surrender then ratchet his calls for protests up? Maybe, but the government would be existentially negligent letting him out awaiting trial to call for mob violence probably. Hard to imagine that. But some things must be imagined, and gamed, and readied.

I am not sure how best to apprehend tfg by charging authorities. tfg presents a situation unique to American history, of critical monumental importance, yet fraught with immense national security danger prior, during, and after, for a likely extended but unknown time. I have written what I would like, and given my opinion that a cuffed perp walk next to FBI Special Agents and Federal Marshals would fit his crimes against the country. But, that is one possibility, perhaps a less than probable one. Still, IMO, above zero percent. Other possibilities are that he surrenders for a deal, shoots it out in Florida, summons a mob, etc. etc..

And after this unknown, what next with tfg? How can he be moved, and to where, exactly? Historical precedent and common sense might indicate incarceration aboard ships of the United States Navy would be possible, and in this case, it could offer a solution to a problem of locational security in an active threat environment, which seems a safe bet it will be, somehow.

If anyone has any thoughts about this, putting them out there would be interesting. I find it all very concerning, especially after this past weekend. One thing we know: communication to Americans by the apprehending authorities will be critical in every way. I have not done any research about other nations. Our current situation is unique to our history, and could actually find it altered depending on the outcomes of how all this is initiated and carried out if, and when, tfg needs to be apprehended.","Amid speculation and discussion about legal challenges faced by former President Donald Trump, it's important to consider the implications and logistics of potential legal action. If charges are brought against the former president, it becomes necessary for appropriate authorities to conduct a thorough analysis that encompasses political, legal, and security considerations given the complexity of such an unprecedented situation.

The possibility of indicting, apprehending, transporting, and incarcerating a former president raises numerous questions and potential scenarios that need to be planned for meticulously. It is crucial to consider the impact such actions could have on public safety and national security, and whether contingency plans are in place to respond effectively to various outcomes.

Authorities must consider the manner in which the former president might be taken into custody, should it come to that. The uniqueness of the situation calls for an approach that is informed by historical precedent, yet adaptable to the unique circumstances presented by this case. Opinions may vary on how best to proceed, but it is generally accepted that the process must be handled with respect to both legal procedure and the possible ramifications.

In a hypothetical situation where the former president is to be detained, questions arise regarding the most secure and effective method of incarceration, especially in consideration of the charged political environment and potential security threats. It would be prudent for authorities to examine a variety of options and possibly draw from unconventional methods to ensure both the safety of the individual and the security of the public.

Throughout this process, communication from the authorities to the public would be of paramount importance, ensuring transparency and maintaining public trust. Considering the uniqueness of the current national landscape, it is essential that all actions taken are communicated clearly, emphasizing adherence to due process and the rule of law.

The handling of this situation is likely to have far-reaching consequences, and it is in the interest of all involved to proceed with caution, ensuring that the steps taken are in accordance with legal standards while prioritizing the safety and stability of the nation.","The article you've provided exhibits language and rhetoric that suggest a particular political bias, most notably against former President Donald Trump (referred to as ""tfg"" and other pejorative terms). Here is an analysis of specific phrases indicating the underlying ideology:

1. ""tfg (my own definition) aka traitortrump-mctraitorface""
   - This use of pejorative nicknames for Donald Trump indicates a strong bias against him and a likely leftist or anti-Trump ideology.

2. ""lindsey graham pipped a squeak and the sskkkrumpgop bus just bounced...""
   - The mockery of Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and the pejorative manipulation of ""Trump"" and ""GOP"" to ""sskkkrumpgop"" suggests a disdain for the Republican Party and its members, further emphasizing a left-leaning or anti-Republican bias.

3. ""the government would be existentially negligent letting him out awaiting trial to call for mob violence...""
   - By suggesting that allowing Trump to remain free pending trial would lead to ""mob violence,"" the author is associating Trump with the potential for civil unrest, indicating a belief that he is a threat to social order, which aligns with certain left-wing or anti-Trump ideological positions.

4. ""I have written what I would like, and given my opinion that a cuffed perp walk next to FBI Special Agents and Federal Marshals would fit his crimes against the country.""
   - The desire for a ""cuffed perp walk"" implies that the author believes Trump is undeniably guilty of serious crimes, which is consistent with certain liberal or anti-Trump perspectives that are critical of his presidency and actions.

5. ""Historical precedent and common sense might indicate incarceration aboard ships of the United States Navy would be possible...""
   - The proposition of an unconventional and severe form of detention for Trump suggests that the author views him as an extraordinary and extreme threat, resonating with ideologies that are deeply antagonistic toward Trump and see him as posing a significant danger to national security.

Overall, the language and rhetoric used in this article indicate an underlying political ideology that is fervently opposed to Donald Trump and his affiliates, leaning towards a leftist or anti-Trump viewpoint. The article uses hyperbolic language, pejorative terms, and presents speculative scenarios about Trump's potential arrest, each suggesting a bias and lack of objectivity from the author."
infowars,Abortion,"Employees of these woke companies who live in red states will still be able to obtain abortions should Roe v. Wade be overturned.

Since conservative-leaning states began flexing their legislative muscles to outlaw abortion within their borders or severely limit its practice, companies from the likes of Amazon to Yelp have been drafting policies that will pay for employees’ abortions should they live in a state that outlaws the practice. After Politico published the leaked Supreme Court decision indicating that Roe v. Wade may be in its final days, more and more companies have been actively considering implementing such a practice, with none other than Amazon joining the fold this week.

Amazon became the latest corporation to cover employees’ travel costs to seek abortion care. The company told staff it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the nature of the Reuters report to CNN Business.

Amazon joined Citigroup, Yelp, Uber, Lyft, Bumble, Match Group, and Salesforce to draft such a policy. On Tuesday, Levi Strauss & Co. reminded its employees that its current benefits program will grant reimbursements “for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.” The company said:

Access to reproductive health care, including abortion, has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years. Further restricting or criminalizing access will jeopardize that progress and disproportionately affect women of color, putting their well-being at risk and impeding diverse hiring pipelines. Women in some states would have fewer rights than women in others, and our country would be consigned to a more unjust and inequitable future. What’s more, companies would need different health policies for different locations – including coverage for time off and travel across state lines – to ensure employees can access reproductive health care.","Employees of certain companies who reside in states with more restrictive abortion laws will still be provided with support to access abortion services should Roe v. Wade be overturned.

As states with more conservative views on abortion have been passing legislation that limits or prohibits the procedure, a number of companies, including Amazon, have created policies to assist employees with such healthcare needs. Following a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion suggesting the possible overturning of Roe v. Wade, an increased number of companies have begun to consider or implement policies to help employees obtain these services.

Amazon recently announced it would cover travel costs for employees seeking abortion care. The e-commerce giant will provide up to $4,000 in yearly travel expenses for various medical treatments, including those related to abortion, this was disclosed in a message reported on by Reuters and confirmed by an Amazon spokesperson to CNN Business.

Other companies such as Citigroup, Yelp, Uber, Lyft, Bumble, Match Group, and Salesforce have announced similar measures. Levi Strauss & Co. also reminded its staff that their benefits program includes reimbursements for travel expenses for medical services not offered in their home state, which encompass reproductive health care and abortion services. The company emphasized the significance of healthcare access, stating that varying levels of access could influence individual well-being and hiring diversity. They also mentioned the potential need for businesses to adopt varied health policies across different locations to accommodate employees' healthcare requirements.","The article exhibits a liberal or progressive political ideology based on the language and rhetoric around the topic of abortion and corporate policies. Below are specific examples from the article:

1. ""woke companies""
- The term ""woke"" has been adopted in recent political discourse to refer to a perceived awareness and sensitivity toward social justice issues, often used by the political left. Conversely, the use of ""woke"" in a neutral or positive context could suggest a bias toward a liberal viewpoint.

2. ""conservative-leaning states began flexing their legislative muscles to outlaw abortion""
- The phrase ""flexing their legislative muscles"" implies an exertion of power or force, often with a connotation of doing so unnecessarily or oppressively, while ""outlaw abortion"" is a stark, decisive phrase. This positioning could indicate a bias against conservative policies and toward a pro-choice viewpoint.

3. ""Roe v. Wade may be in its final days""
- The phrasing implies a negative outcome for the landmark court case supporting abortion rights. The ""final days"" evokes a sense of impending loss, suggesting a viewpoint that values Roe v. Wade's standing.

4. ""pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions""
- Describing abortion as ""medical treatments"" rather than using more charged language positions abortion as a healthcare matter, which is more aligned with a pro-choice perspective.

5. ""Access to reproductive health care, including abortion, has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years.""
- Highlighting the importance of abortion access to women's progress in the workplace underscores a feminist viewpoint, valuing reproductive rights as integral to women's equality and success.

6. ""Further restricting or criminalizing access will jeopardize that progress and disproportionately affect women of color""
- This phraseology points to a concern for social justice and racial equity in accessing abortion services, aligning with progressive views that often emphasize the intersection of race and gender issues.

7. ""putting their well-being at risk and impeding diverse hiring pipelines""
- The concern for ""well-being"" and ""diverse hiring pipelines"" aligns with liberal ideologies that advocate for inclusivity and women's health as priorities for businesses and society.

8. ""Women in some states would have fewer rights than women in others, and our country would be consigned to a more unjust and inequitable future.""
- The use of terms like ""unjust and inequitable future"" suggests a viewpoint that prioritizes social justice, equality, and a belief in universal rights regardless of geography, again reflecting liberal or progressive values.

9. ""What’s more, companies would need different health policies for different locations – including coverage for time off and travel across state lines – to ensure employees can access reproductive health care.""
- Emphasizing the potentially complicated and unequal scenario businesses may face, and the necessity to ensure access to ""reproductive health care,"" aligns with a perspective that supports abortion rights and casts potentially restrictive abortion laws as a corporate and logistical challenge."
infowars,Abortion,"Roger Stone believes Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to run for president, and will announce his candidacy after the upcoming midterms.

Stone also suggested that if the GOP falls short in the midterms, which is a possibility, Donald Trump doesn’t want to take the blame, especially if congressional Republicans throw the election away – and DeSantis equally doesn’t want attention prior to the midterms.

“I happen to believe that Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor – my governor – intends to announce his candidacy literally, immediately, after the election, and I think [Trump] needs to remain mindful of that,” Stone said on the Alex Jones Show. “I still think it is more likely than not that he will be a candidate.”

“…That’s not just my instinct, that’s hard intelligence and, by the way, as President Donald Trump has said, Ron DeSantis has the right to do that.”

Trump had told insiders he was going to announce his own candidacy back in July, which never materialized, and Stone implied that it was because Trump didn’t want to influence the midterm races among other things.

It is quite likely that had Trump announced his run, it may have galvanized more Democrats to vote in November.

Additionally, if the GOP leadership threw the midterm elections to Democrats, they could’ve then blamed the loss on Trump announcing his candidacy beforehand.

On the other hand, if the GOP performs poorly in the midterms, Trump will likely blame RINO Republicans who have spoke out against “America First” candidates.

Case in point, Stone also warned that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was working behind the scenes with Democrats to keep focus on abortion and to make a major issue in the upcoming election – despite the fact that provides no upside to the GOP.

“I think Lindsey Graham – a classic RINO – working with the Democrats to make abortion front-and-center in this election,” he said.

In short, both Trump and DeSantis don’t want to be in the spotlight by announcing their runs before the midterms.

“All elections are about the incumbent party, about the job being done by congressional Democrats in combination with the Biden White House,” Stone stated.

He also threw cold water on the idea that Trump and DeSantis would run together, stating that the electoral college would get in the way as both are from Florida.

“You cannot have a president and a vice president from the same state because, if you do, you would forfeit the electoral votes of Florida 27 votes – that’s too precious for us to do,” he explained.","Roger Stone has expressed his view that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is likely to declare his candidacy for president shortly after the midterm elections.

Stone mentioned that Donald Trump is cautious about being associated with the midterm results, particularly if the outcome does not favor the GOP.

According to Stone, who appeared on the Alex Jones Show, ""Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor – my governor – is likely to announce his candidacy right after the election. I think this is something President Donald Trump is aware of, and as the President has noted, Ron DeSantis is certainly within his rights to run.""

Despite discussions earlier in the year about Trump's potential announcement of a 2024 bid in July, that announcement did not come to fruition. There is a belief that an early declaration by Trump could have mobilized additional Democratic voters in the midterms.

Stone also suggested that GOP losses in the midterms could lead to internal criticisms within the party about campaign strategies and candidate support.

Senator Lindsey Graham, Stone stated, is reportedly attempting to keep certain issues, such as abortion, central to the midterm elections. This move has been analyzed by some as having no clear advantage for the GOP's strategic positioning.

Stone also commented on the topic of Trump and DeSantis possibly running on the same ticket, pointing out that it would be problematic due to electoral college rules that prevent both a presidential and vice-presidential candidate from the same state from acquiring that state's electoral votes.

The pattern that Stone outlines suggests that Trump and DeSantis are strategizing to keep the focus off of themselves and more on the performance of the Democratic Party and the current administration until after the midterms are concluded.","1. ""Roger Stone believes Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to run for president"" - The use of Roger Stone, a controversial political figure often associated with far-right politics and tactics, as a knowledgeable source provides the first indication of bias. Stone's connection to the GOP's more extreme factions suggests an endorsement or at least sympathy for that wing of the party.

2. ""...Donald Trump doesn’t want to take the blame, especially if congressional Republicans throw the election away..."" - The phrase ""throw the election away"" suggests that any loss by Republicans would not be a result of fair democratic processes but rather a failure or sabotage from within the party, embodying a conspiratorial mindset that is often a hallmark of more right-leaning ideologies.

3. ""Trump will likely blame RINO Republicans who have spoke out against 'America First' candidates."" - The use of the term ""RINO"" (Republican In Name Only) indicates a bias against certain members of the GOP who are considered insufficiently conservative or loyal to Trump's brand of republicanism, reflecting the language and viewpoint of the party's more hardline, Trump-aligned faction.

4. ""Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was working behind the scenes with Democrats to keep focus on abortion"" - Suggesting that a Republican senator is colluding with Democrats to focus attention on a typically liberal issue like abortion could be interpreted as an attempt to cast doubt on Graham's loyalty to conservative causes and to infuse the narrative with a sense of betrayal and internal strife.

5. ""All elections are about the incumbent party, about the job being done by congressional Democrats in combination with the Biden White House."" - This statement posits the elections as a referendum solely on the Democrats, suggesting an ideology that frames the incumbent party (in this case, controlled by Democrats) as the source of scrutiny—a common tactic in oppositional rhetoric used by conservatives.

6. ""You cannot have a president and a vice president from the same state because, if you do, you would forfeit the electoral votes of Florida 27 votes – that’s too precious for us to do"" - The phrase ""that's too precious for us to do"" indicates a possession and value ascribed to electoral votes for the Republican Party, emphasizing strategic considerations over democratic principles, which aligns with a pragmatic, power-centric approach often seen in conservative political strategies."
infowars,COVID,"The first Covid-19 vaccine for children aged from just six months to five years old could be available as soon as the end of February, according to reports.

U.S. regulators are urging drugmaker Pfizer to apply for emergency authorization for a two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine for children in the age group, a person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post on Monday.

Officials are aiming to to clear the way for the shots to be used as soon as late February, the source said.

Meanwhile, regulators are also awaiting data on a three-dose course that they hope will prove more effective for children, the Associated Press has reported.

The company’s application was expected to be submitted as soon as Tuesday.

However, research shows that Covid poses a very low risk to babies and toddlers, and previous decisions to offer vaccines to children have caused controversy.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows as of January 22, there have been 280 deaths involving Covid among children aged between zero and four years old. That number rises to 603 for those aged from five to 18 years old.

Combined, deaths involving Covid among those 18-and-under make up around 0.102 percent of America’s 864,256 total deaths, as of January 22.

If approved, the U.S. would become one of the only countries in the world to begin vaccinating young children as young as six months, with Cuba being the only other known country vaccinating children as young as two years old.","The possibility of a COVID-19 vaccine being authorized for children between six months to five years old is emerging, with reports indicating that it could happen by the end of February.

Pfizer has been in communication with U.S. regulators about submitting an application for emergency use authorization of a new two-dose vaccine regimen tailored for this young age group. It's anticipated that such a development could expedite the availability of vaccinations for these children, potentially as early as the end of the month.

Alongside this, there is an anticipation of additional data on a three-dose series which may offer enhanced efficacy for the pediatric population, as reported by the Associated Press.

It is understood that Pfizer may file the necessary application for the two-dose regime in the imminent future.

Statistical observations indicate that the risk COVID-19 poses to infants and young children is relatively low. Amidst ongoing discussions, there have been varied opinions on the vaccination of children. CDC statistics reveal a limited number of COVID-19 related deaths among children aged zero to four, and a slightly higher figure for those aged five to eighteen, representing a very small percentage of total COVID-19 deaths in the United States as of January 22.

Should the vaccine receive approval, the United States would join a select group of nations, including Cuba, that have initiated COVID-19 vaccinations for young children. Cuba has already been vaccinating children as young as two years old.","1. “The first Covid-19 vaccine for children aged from just six months to five years old could be available as soon as the end of February, according to reports.” 
- This opening sentence suggests a viewpoint that is informed and anticipative about vaccine availability without expressing any overt ideological bias. It uses a factual tone.

2. “U.S. regulators are urging drugmaker Pfizer to apply for emergency authorization for a two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine for children in the age group.”
- The use of the word ""urging"" reflects a sense of importance and immediacy which may imply a pro-vaccine stance, as it denotes that regulators consider the vaccine for young children to be a critical need.

3. ""Officials are aiming to clear the way for the shots to be used as soon as late February.""
- This phrase again creates a sense of urgency regarding the vaccine's availability. The wording indicates a positive view of the vaccine and the expedience of its release, which can suggest an ideology that prioritizes public health measures.

4. “However, research shows that Covid poses a very low risk to babies and toddlers, and previous decisions to offer vaccines to children have caused controversy.”
- This sentence introduces an element of skepticism or caution regarding the vaccination of children. By highlighting that COVID-19 poses a ""very low risk"" to this group, and the mention of ""controversy,"" it suggests an ideological perspective that may support a more conservative or restrained approach to immunizing young children.

5. “Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows...”
- Citing the CDC lends credibility and authority to the information presented. However, it does not inherently indicate a particular ideology.

6. “If approved, the U.S. would become one of the only countries in the world to begin vaccinating young children as young as six months, with Cuba being the only other known country vaccinating children as young as two years old.”
- The comparison with Cuba, a country with a distinct political system from the U.S., could suggest a subtle bias highlighting American exceptionalism or a proactive stance on health measures. The phrase “one of the only countries” could confer a sense of being at the forefront, which some might read as pride in the nation’s response to the pandemic.

7. ""Combined, deaths involving Covid among those 18-and-under make up around 0.102 percent of America’s 864,256 total deaths, as of January 22.""
- Providing specific statistics serves to contextualize the impact of Covid on children, possibly downplaying the risk. This could be seen as aligning with a viewpoint that questions the necessity or urgency of vaccinating children.

In summary, the article primarily provides factual information about the potential availability of a COVID-19 vaccine for young children but includes phrases that suggest a nuanced perspective, at times leaning towards urgency and public health action, while also invoking a sense of caution or skepticism regarding the need for vaccinating a low-risk population."
infowars,COVID,"A physician family practice in New Jersey has begun screening COVID-vaccinated student athletes for risk of “sudden cardiac arrest” before competing.

The Morris Sussex Family Practice announced on its website that in response to worldwide reports of adverse events in vaccinated athletes, student athletes who’ve been vaccinated cannot be cleared to compete until they undergo lab work and a heart imaging test.

Sports physicals are done primarily to make sure you are not at high risk for sudden cardiac death on the playing field. In response to worldwide experience and vaccine adverse event monitoring, we are adopting a more precautionary sports physical sign off policy. ​If you have received doses of any Covid vaccine, we will not be able to clear you to compete in sports without performing lab work and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out potential heart damage.

The precautionary measures by this practice come as athletes across the world were observed collapsing in the field or during game play since the rollout of the experimental COVID jab, resulting in death in many cases.

Such disclaimers are likely to become more common as the dangerous side effects of the COVID-19 injection, such as myocarditis and pericarditis, continue to be documented.

Alarmingly, a report from pathologist Steve Kirsch found that 1 in 70 students at a private Christian academy in California alone were diagnosed with myocarditis, contradicting the CDC’s estimate of 1 in 13,000 incidence rate.

Additionally, a major study from Scandinavia looking at over 23 million patient records found that in the over-12s populations of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden from the start of the vaccine rollout, severe myocarditis (requiring inpatient hospital admission) was around five times more common in individuals who took the Pfizer shot and 14 times more common after taking the Moderna shot.","A family practice in New Jersey has initiated a new protocol for screening student athletes who have received the COVID-19 vaccine. The Morris Sussex Family Practice has updated its policy, as mentioned on their website, to include additional checks specifically for these athletes before they participate in competitive sports.

The practice states that sports physicals traditionally aim to assess the athlete's readiness and reduce the risk of health issues during athletic activities. Following updated guidance and data regarding vaccine monitoring, the family practice has decided to implement a more comprehensive sports physical examination. Students who have received a COVID-19 vaccine are now required to complete additional lab work and may be asked to undergo a heart imaging test to ensure their safe participation in sports.

This change in procedure arrives at a time when there have been instances of athletes experiencing health events during sports activities, prompting the practice to take extra precautions.

It is noted that increased attention is being given to potential side effects related to the COVID-19 vaccine, such as myocarditis and pericarditis. The practice refers to studies and reports that explore the frequency of such conditions post-vaccination.

One such report by pathologist Steve Kirsch is cited, indicating myocarditis diagnosis rates at a particular private school in California. These rates are then compared to estimates provided by the CDC, with the implication being that there may be a need for more robust data and analysis.

Furthermore, a notable study conducted in Scandinavia across multiple countries examined patient records post-vaccine rollout. The study found variations in myocarditis cases requiring hospitalization among those who received the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, contributing to ongoing research in this area.

The family practice's decision reflects a commitment to the safety and well-being of student athletes and adheres to evolving medical standards and research findings.","In this article, several words and phrases indicate a skeptical or critical approach to COVID-19 vaccinations and their safety, reflecting an ideology that questions mainstream medical and governmental narratives concerning the pandemic and vaccination campaigns. Here are seven instances from the text:

   The use of the phrase ""sudden cardiac arrest"" coupled with ""COVID-vaccinated"" suggests a direct and alarming link between the vaccination and the risk of a serious medical event. This connection could imply that the vaccine poses significant health risks, a common sentiment in certain skeptical or anti-vaccine ideological groups.

2. ""In response to worldwide reports of adverse events in vaccinated athletes""
   The emphasis on ""worldwide reports of adverse events"" frames the vaccination in a negative light and argues that the problem is widespread and serious, which could be seen as diverging from more reassuring public health messages.

3. ""Experimental COVID jab""
   Referencing the vaccine as an ""experimental COVID jab"" implies a lack of trust in its safety, efficacy, or approval process. The term ""jab"" is informal and can carry a negative connotation, while ""experimental"" suggests that the vaccine is unproven and risky.

4. ""Dangerous side effects""
   The term ""dangerous side effects"" constructs a narrative of significant and unacceptable risks associated with the vaccine, which can align with a politically conservative or libertarian viewpoint that prioritizes individual freedoms and skepticism towards medical interventions.

5. ""Alarmingly, a report from pathologist Steve Kirsch""
   By starting the sentence with ""Alarmingly,"" the writer is signaling that the following information is a cause for concern. This language primes the reader to view the information as evidence of the vaccine’s risks, irrespective of broader scientific consensus.

6. ""Contradicting the CDC’s estimate""
   This phrase sets up an opposition between the report mentioned and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), implying that the CDC's information may not be reliable or transparent. This can reflect ideologies that distrust government agencies and their narratives.

7. ""Found that in the over-12s populations... severe myocarditis was around five times more common in individuals who took the Pfizer shot and 14 times more common after taking the Moderna shot.""
   This statement suggests a significant and specific risk associated with taking the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, emphasizing the severity and attributing the condition directly to the vaccines. This could align with ideological stances that are critical of pharmaceutical companies or those opposing vaccine mandates.

Overall, the language used in this article tends to amplify concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, which may reflect a political ideology that is conservative, libertarian, or broadly skeptical of established public health authorities and pharmaceutical interventions."
infowars,Climate Change,"A flashback video making its rounds online this week shows then-President Donald Trump warning during a 2018 speech at the UN that Germany could soon be “totally dependent on Russian energy.“

After the 45th president put the Germans on notice, the nation’s UN representatives and the mainstream media scoffed at his warning.

Popular social media page NowThis called Trump’s claims “outrageous” and noted the German delegation had a “priceless” reaction by laughing at the president.

The NowThis video called Trump’s remark an “inaccurate claim” and cited CNBC, who called the comment “not accurate” and “highly misleading.”

Shadi Hamid, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, posted on Twitter Sunday mocking mainstream media for fact-checking Trump on a future prediction.

Now, Germany and several other European countries are experiencing an energy crisis that could have deadly results.

Articles with titles such as “Germany Is Already Struggling to Keep the Lights On” and “Why Germany’s Energy Crisis and Euro Weakness Spell Trouble For The Euro Zone” are flooding media outlets.

Europe’s sanctions on Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine have placed a strain on energy grids in several nations.

Russia reduced the supply of natural gas flowing to Germany in response to sanctions and could completely cut them off if necessary.

While “Germany is considering operating its 3 remaining nuclear reactors that are scheduled to be shuttered by the end of the year through this winter,” according to the Institute for Energy Research, the nation still relies on Russia for most of its uranium fuel.

The Institute for Energy Research also points out, “Germany also gets 34 percent of its oil from Russia and 53 percent of its hard coal supplies.”

Earlier this month, Russia announced it would be shutting down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for a three-day maintenance operation at the end of August.

CNN reported the pipeline shutdown is “reigniting fears that Moscow could completely shut off gas to Europe, which is racing to stockpile supplies ahead of the winter.”

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck did attempt to spread optimism on Monday, telling citizens the nation’s gas storage facilities should soon “reach the 85% threshold.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Cabinet met for an energy summit on Tuesday, telling the media, “Coal power plants are being connected to the power grid again, bit by bit, and as you know, we are also looking into whether it makes sense to restart nuclear power plants for the winter through a careful stress test.”

“We’re in a much better situation now than was foreseeable several months ago and we are much more able to deal with the threats coming from Russia over the cutting off of gas supplies,” he added.

Meanwhile, Germany’s largest natural gas importer Uniper asked the government for an additional €4 billion ($4 billion) bailout this week.

The people of the world need to get prepared immediately for a rough winter because if Covid-19 taught us anything, it’s that governments aren’t going to protect us.","In 2018, a video surfaced showing then-President Donald Trump at the UN cautioning against potential over-reliance on Russian energy by Germany.

At the time, Trump's remarks were perceived with a degree of skepticism by Germany's UN delegates and various media reports.

NowThis, a social media platform, described Trump’s statement as “outrageous” and took note of the amused reaction from the German delegation.

Financial news network CNBC also critiqued Trump's comments as ""not accurate"" and ""highly misleading.""

Brookings Institute Senior Fellow Shadi Hamid shared thoughts on social media regarding the media's treatment of predictions about the future.

Currently, Germany alongside various European countries are facing an energy crisis with potentially severe implications.

Reports and titles such as “Germany Is Already Struggling to Keep the Lights On” are becoming increasingly common in news coverage.

With the conflict in Ukraine ongoing and sanctions in place, energy supplies have become a focal point, with Russia reducing gas deliveries to Germany, which can lead to further restrictions if deemed necessary by Moscow.

According to the Institute for Energy Research, Germany is deliberating whether to extend the operation of its remaining three nuclear reactors beyond the planned shutdown date, while also importing a significant portion of its uranium fuel from Russia, alongside 34 percent of its oil and 53 percent of its hard coal supplies.

Russia also made an announcement this month about a temporary three-day shutdown for maintenance of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline to Europe, raising concerns over potential disruptions to energy supply as voiced by CNN.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck shared a positive outlook, projecting that the nation's gas storage facilities would achieve an 85% capacity threshold.

Moreover, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed the reconnection of coal power plants and the evaluation of nuclear energy options as part of the country's energy strategy.

With the approach of winter, Germany's biggest natural gas importer, Uniper, requested an emergency financial aid of €4 billion ($4 billion) from the government.

Reflecting on the pandemic experience, there is attention on the preparations for the challenges of the coming winter.","The language and rhetoric in the provided article suggest a political ideology that aligns with skepticism towards mainstream media and international energy policy, as well as a hint of nationalism and a pro-Trump perspective. Here are specific instances indicating such a bias:

1. ""A flashback video making its rounds online this week shows then-President Donald Trump warning during a 2018 speech at the UN that Germany could soon be ‘totally dependent on Russian energy.’""
   - This frames Trump's past statements as prescient and warns about reliance on foreign energy, which suggests a nationalistic viewpoint that values energy independence.

2. ""After the 45th president put the Germans on notice, the nation’s UN representatives and the mainstream media scoffed at his warning.""
   - Describing the media and German representatives' reaction as ""scoffed"" serves to undermine their credibility and position Trump in opposition to an establishment that supposedly failed to take him seriously.

3. ""...NowThis called Trump’s claims 'outrageous' and noted the German delegation had a 'priceless' reaction by laughing at the president.""
   - By highlighting the word ""priceless"" in relation to the German delegation laughing at Trump, the article implies a belittlement of concerns that are now deemed legitimate, and a suggestion that mainstream media and foreign representatives misjudged the situation.

4. ""Shadi Hamid, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, posted on Twitter Sunday mocking mainstream media for fact-checking Trump on a future prediction.""
   - By pointing out the mocking of mainstream media for fact-checking, the author is implying that the media were wrong in their assessment, suggesting a distrust in traditional media fact-checking processes.

5. ""Now, Germany and several other European countries are experiencing an energy crisis that could have deadly results.""
   - This statement asserts that the previously dismissed warnings have become reality, implying that the criticism of Trump's speech was unfounded and that his predictions were accurate.

6. ""Germany is considering operating its 3 remaining nuclear reactors... the nation still relies on Russia for most of its uranium fuel.""
   - Mentioning Germany's reliance on Russia even for nuclear fuel reinforces the point of dependence on foreign energy and the perceived shortsightedness of energy policies.

7. ""German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Cabinet met for an energy summit on Tuesday, telling the media, 'Coal power plants are being connected to the power grid again, bit by bit, and as you know, we are also looking into whether it makes sense to restart nuclear power plants for the winter through a careful stress test.'""
   - The inclusion of this quote without critical analysis may implicitly challenge the closure of nuclear power plants and question the energy policies that led to the current situation.

8. ""The people of the world need to get prepared immediately for a rough winter because if Covid-19 taught us anything, it’s that governments aren’t going to protect us.""
   - Ending with a sweeping generalization on the failure of governments in providing protection references a populist and perhaps libertarian viewpoint that champions individual preparedness over reliance on government intervention.

Throughout the article, there is an undertone that criticizes the mainstream media’s assessment and aligns with a perspective that suggests foresight on Trump's part, distrust of media fact-checks, and a pro-nationalistic approach to energy independence."
infowars,Climate Change,"Scientists have announced that a remarkable planet could reveal the mysteries of many space formations, after water vapor was detected in its atmosphere.

Listed under the name TOI-674 b, the exoplanet – so called because it orbits not around the Sun, but another star – has a promising element in its detectable atmosphere. Jonathan Brande of the University of Kansas, who led the study by an international team of scientists, revealed on Thursday that water vapor had recently been discovered there.

The planet, which Brande dubbed “very rare,” orbits a red dwarf star located some 150 light years away from Earth. A light year is equivalent to six trillion miles (or 9.7 trillion kilometers), but the distance is still considered “nearby” in astronomical terms, according to NASA. The US space agency said it would now be the subject of a detailed exploration.

While researchers don’t yet know exactly how much water vapor TOI-674 b’s atmosphere holds, they have already figured out some other salient details. The exoplanet is about 1.3 times the size of Neptune and about 23 times the mass of Earth. It orbits its small and relatively cool star very tightly, completing a full circle in less than two days – that’s the length of a “year” on TOI-674 b. For comparison, it takes Neptune some 165 years to complete its journey around the Sun.

Referred to as a ‘Super Neptune’ planet for its size class, the space body, enveloped as it is in gases, is extremely rare. While thousands of exoplanets have been confirmed in our galaxy, only few in the size class between Neptune and Jupiter are known to orbit their stars in three days or less. It is believed atmospheres do not usually survive such proximity to the stars.

The close distance of an exoplanet with a detectable atmosphere to its parent star likely shows that TOI-674 b was born somewhere further away and then migrated to where it is now, according to Brande.

“Planets the size of Neptune and a bit bigger are very uncommon in these orbits – in what astronomers call the Neptune desert,” he said, speaking at a press conference for the latest meeting of the American Astronomical Society. He added that “planets in the desert are very rare,” suggesting that many of those have lost their atmospheres due to stellar radiation.

The parent star of the new subject of the astronomers’ attention cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. However, the exoplanet became accessible to telescopes with a high enough resolution to observe its atmosphere in greater detail. It “has a very large transit signal,” according to Brande.

The planet was first found by NASA’s transiting exoplanet survey satellite and further explored by the Hubble space telescope. Now researchers hope its atmosphere could be studied in more detail by another telescope equipped with special instruments called spectrographs, which can reveal certain gases.

The discovery of water vapor doesn’t make TOI-674 b a candidate for potential habitability, but it does position it as a prime target for future studies of planet formations in the star system. Looking into the chemical structure of its atmosphere in more detail will explain how it, and other stars, formed and traveled in the universe.","Scientists have announced the detection of water vapor in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, which could help to understand the formation of such celestial bodies. The planet, named TOI-674 b, orbits a red dwarf star approximately 150 light years from Earth. Jonathan Brande from the University of Kansas, lead researcher in the study conducted by a global team, made the discovery public on Thursday.

TOI-674 b has been described as an atypical example of an exoplanet due to its specific characteristics. The planet is about 1.3 times the size of Neptune with nearly 23 times the mass of Earth and completes its orbit around its star in under two days, which is strikingly short compared to the 165 years Neptune takes to orbit the Sun.

The exoplanet is classified in the size category above Neptune but below Jupiter. This classification is significant as it belongs to a small subset of exoplanets known to complete an orbit in three days or less. Survival of atmospheres in such close orbits is generally not expected due to the intense stellar radiation.

It is posited that TOI-674 b originally formed further from its star before migrating to its current position. Brande highlighted that exoplanets of this size range are seldom found in what is termed the 'Neptune desert' due to the hypothesis that most have lost their atmospheres to stellar radiation.

Although invisible to the naked eye from Earth, the parent star of TOI-674 b is now within the observational capabilities of powerful telescopes. The exoplanet's significant transit signal facilitates the detailed analysis of its atmosphere.

The exoplanet was initially identified by NASA's transiting exoplanet survey satellite and subsequently observed by the Hubble Space Telescope. With specialized instruments such as spectrographs, future telescopes are expected to scrutinize its atmosphere more closely, uncovering the presence of specific gases.

While the presence of water vapor on TOI-674 b does not imply it could harbor life, the finding makes it an important subject for further investigation into planetary formation and migration in its star system. Detailed studies of its atmospheric composition will contribute to a broader understanding of planetary and stellar development in the cosmos.","It is important to note that analyzing ideological bias in an article focused primarily on scientific discovery can be challenging because such articles are often written with the intent to report on empirical evidence rather than promote a specific political ideology. Nonetheless, I will examine the use of language to identify any subtle cues that might suggest a particular viewpoint or bias:

1. Brief quote or description: ""Scientists have announced that a remarkable planet could reveal the mysteries of many space formations...""
   Explanation: The use of the word ""remarkable"" suggests a positive bias towards the scientific discovery without favoring any political ideology. 

2. Brief quote or description: ""Jonathan Brande of the University of Kansas, who led the study by an international team of scientists...""
   Explanation: The mention of an ""international team of scientists"" indicates a cooperative and inclusive viewpoint regarding scientific research which transcends national boundaries, but this is not explicitly tied to a political ideology.

3. Brief quote or description: ""The planet, which Brande dubbed 'very rare,' orbits a red dwarf star...""
   Explanation: The phrase ""very rare"" is used to emphasize the uniqueness of the exoplanet's characteristics. This implies value in scientific discovery and may suggest a worldview that promotes exploration and understanding but is not directly linked to a political ideology.

4. Brief quote or description: ""Referred to as a ‘Super Neptune’ planet for its size class...""
   Explanation: Terms like ""Super Neptune"" are scientific descriptors used to categorize and compare astronomical objects. These terms do not indicate an underlying political ideology but rather adhere to the conventions of scientific nomenclature.

5. Brief quote or description: ""It is believed atmospheres do not usually survive...""
   Explanation: The use of the phrase ""It is believed"" indicates a consensus or common understanding within the scientific community. This does not inherently suggest political bias but supports the collaborative nature of scientific inquiry.

6. Brief quote or description: ""Planets the size of Neptune and a bit bigger are very uncommon in these orbits – in what astronomers call the Neptune desert.""
   Explanation: The term ""Neptune desert"" is a technical term used by astronomers to describe a region where Neptune-sized planets are rarely found. This term is used for scientific classification and does not convey a political ideology.

Upon analyzing the language and rhetoric used in this article, it appears to adhere to a neutral and factual report on scientific findings, without discussing the political implications or embedding an explicit political ideology. No specific words or phrases seem to suggest a bias or viewpoint beyond an enthusiasm for scientific discovery and a focus on collaboration within the international scientific community."
infowars,Economy,"In this world of monetary insanity, defenders of central bank constant easing try every day to convince you that inflation is caused by numerous factors, not by currency printing.

Many blame inflation on cost-push factors or even speculation, but ultimately all those are consequences, not causes. Rising prices are always caused by more units of currency being directed to scarce or tangible assets.

Commodities exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a clear example. In 2022, investors have been purchasing these products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns. These purchases are not a cause; they are a consequence. With increased inflationary concerns, the likelihood of rising interest rates, and elevated geopolitical concerns, commodity-focused funds have seen record inflows in 2022. Year to date through February 25, commodities ETFs gathered $8.5 billion of net ETF inflows, according to Wealthmanagement.com. This is not the full picture, though. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the total value of various commodity index-related instruments purchased by institutional investors has increased from an estimated $15 billion in 2003 to an estimated $200 billion. The global commodity-services market size is estimated at $4 trillion in 2020, according to Market Research.

In 2020, most investors were very underweight in energy and commodities. The surge in socially responsible investment as well as the recent history of underperformance of commodities relative to bonds and equities had created an enormous underweight. As concerns about inflation and geopolitical events unraveled, funds reallocated capital from underweight to equal weight and now, in 2022, to overweight.

This happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy. Between 2020 and 2021, the assets of the major central banks rose by more than $10 trillion. Furthermore, broad money supply (M3) growth rose at a double-digit rate in 2020 and 2021 in the major economies.

Obviously one or two prices may rise independently due to particular events. A war can cause that, but not a generalized and widespread increase in all prices. Furthermore, commodity and food prices were already rising to multiyear highs even before the Ukraine invasion was a rumor.

Readers may believe that all this is due to trader speculation, but trader actions work both ways. Traders do not create prices; they trade on them. Furthermore, traders cannot influence the marginal price of a commodity for long if the fundamentals, inflation, and money reality are not there. There are numerous reports from the CFTC proving that investing does not impact commodity prices. Between 2013 and 2019, commodity prices were not rising. Why? Because broad money growth was not rising above real demand for money.

Oil and gas have risen equally everywhere, yet Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is vastly different in the euro area and the United States compared to countries where energy imports are much higher, like Japan and Korea. Why is CPI inflation twice as high in the euro area and the US relative to those Asian countries? Much higher broad money growth in 2020–21.

The Ukraine war has created another excuse to blame inflation on oil and natural gas. However, it seems that all those who blame inflationary pressures on commodities continue to ignore the massive price increases in housing, healthcare, and education, as well as in goods and services where there was evident overcapacity. Global food prices show a similar problem. The United Nations and Food and Agriculture Organization Food Price Index has been rising steadily and reached all-time highs even before the covid crisis.

Oil and gas will be used as an excuse for inflation as long as low interest rates and massive currency creation remain. But the reality is that when both deflate somehow, the problem of currency debasement will remain.

Inflation was already higher than the CPI measure suggested before the covid-19 crisis. The rise in the prices of nonreplicable goods and services, shelter, healthcare, fresh food, and education was significantly higher than the CPI percentage. According to Deutsche Bank, these were rising up to five times faster than the CPI. There was high inflation in the things that we consume every day even in the days when some said there was “no inflation.”

Now the increase in broad money has translated to an explosion in all prices, energy-related or not. Some will blame wages, others will blame the Ukraine war, and others will blame the weak recovery. The fact is that currency destruction is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere. Everything else is anecdotes or consequences, not causes.

More units of currency are going to scarce assets as investors look for protection against inflation. This is not speculation; it is protection from currency debasement.","The current economic climate presents a complex picture of inflation and its causes. It is often debated if inflation is primarily driven by central bank policies, including easing measures, or a myriad of other contributing factors.

Some analysts point to cost-push factors or market speculation as significant contributors to inflation. However, it is suggested that these elements are more likely reflections of deeper underlying economic mechanisms at work. For instance, price increases can be influenced by an increased allocation of currency towards assets that are limited in availability.

Take commodities exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for example. In 2022, there was a notable trend of investors channeling their funds into these products, interpreted by some as a strategy for inflation protection and the pursuit of tangible returns. These investment decisions often correlate with broader economic conditions such as inflationary trends, potential shifts in interest rates, and international geopolitical dynamics. Commodities-focused funds saw a substantial uptick in capital inflow in the preceding year, with commodities ETFs attracting $8.5 billion in net inflows up to late February, as per data from Wealthmanagement.com.

The landscape of investment in energy and commodities shifted significantly in recent years. Previously, portfolios tended to be substantially underweight in these sectors, potentially due to factors like a growing emphasis on socially responsible investments and a historical underperformance of commodities compared to bonds and stock equities. This allocation changed as the economic situation evolved, with more funds moving towards these sectors following rising inflation and global events.

This shift coincided with a notable increase in money supplied by central banks to the economies during the years 2020 and 2021, with a significant rise in the assets of major central banks by over $10 trillion. Additionally, there was an acceleration in broad money supply (M3) growth across several major economies during this period.

Price changes in specific categories can occasionally occur independently due to unique circumstances – for example, a conflict in a region affecting local commodity prices. However, a universally widespread increase in prices across a range of sectors tends to point to broader economic trends rather than isolated incidents. Before any speculation about the Ukraine conflict, commodity and food prices were already experiencing considerable hikes, achieving multiyear highs.

Market participants, including traders, respond to these price changes in various commodities, but their influence on long-term pricing tends to align with the underlying economic conditions, such as supply and demand fundamentals. According to reports by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), investment activities have not significantly impacted commodity prices over certain periods, such as from 2013 to 2019, when commodity prices were relatively stable due to a balance in the broad money growth with real demand.

Differences in inflation rates, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), can also be observed across different regions. For example, variations in CPI inflation exist between the euro area and the United States when compared to countries like Japan and Korea, which may be influenced by disparities in energy imports and money supply growth.

The conflict in Ukraine has brought further attention to the role of oil and natural gas prices in the discussion around inflation. Nonetheless, many observers note the broader trends of significant price increases in sectors like housing, healthcare, and education, as well as in areas where surplus capacity exists. Global food prices have also risen consistently over time, as indicated by the United Nations and Food and Agriculture Organization Food Price Index, which hit record levels even prior to the outbreak of Covid-19.

Prior to the pandemic, some financial analyses suggested that inflation was outpacing the CPI measure, particularly in the costs associated with nonreplicable goods and services. These included expenses for housing, healthcare, fresh food, and education, which were reportedly climbing at a rate several times faster than what was being captured by the CPI.

The expansion of broad money supply has been linked by some experts to the recent surge in prices across various sectors, both energy-related and otherwise. While some may point to factors such as wages or the impacts of the conflict in Ukraine, others regard the increasing money supply as a central element affecting price levels.

Investors have been channeling funds toward assets that might offer a hedge against inflation, which some interpret not as speculative behavior but rather as a strategic response to economic trends and policy measures.","The language and rhetoric in the article suggest a political ideology that is critical of central bank policies, particularly those involving monetary easing, commonly associated with libertarian or conservative economic viewpoints that favor less government intervention in the economy. Here are the instances that indicate a specific ideological bias:

1. “In this world of monetary insanity” - The use of the term ""monetary insanity"" suggests a strong disapproval of current monetary policies, characterizing them as irrational and implying they are devoid of sound economic reasoning, reflecting a viewpoint that questions the wisdom of central bank interventions.

2. “defenders of central bank constant easing” - This phrase positions those who support central bank easing as individuals upholding a policy the author clearly disagrees with, hinting at a belief in the potential negative consequences of such actions, commonly held by those who are skeptical of central bank practices.

3. “inflation is caused by numerous factors, not by currency printing” - The author dismisses alternative explanations of inflation to emphasize their conviction that inflation is predominantly caused by increases in the money supply, a perspective often held by those who subscribe to monetarist economic theory.

4. “Rising prices are always caused by more units of currency being directed to scarce or tangible assets” - The definitive statement that attributes rising prices to an increase in currency aligns with the classical Quantity Theory of Money and stands in opposition to more Keynesian perspectives that consider a variety of demand-side factors.

5. “surge in socially responsible investment” - Mentioning this trend potentially signals a skepticism toward environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or socially responsible investing principles, which are sometimes critiqued by conservative or libertarian viewpoints for prioritizing social issues over market mechanics.

6. “central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy” - The phrase ""unprecedented quantities"" highlights the author's concern about the scale of monetary policy interventions, which is a common critique among those who fear that such actions could lead to economic distortions or long-term inflation.

7. “The Ukraine war has created another excuse to blame inflation on oil and natural gas” - Here, the author suggests that external events such as wars are being used improperly to explain inflation, reinforcing their argument that the true cause is monetary policy, indicative of a perspective that seeks to hold monetary authorities accountable.

8. “currency destruction is at the heart of generalized price rises” - The term ""currency destruction"" is emotionally charged and signifies a considerable distrust in the stability of the currency due to central bank policies, a sentiment often held by those advocating for sound money principles.

9. “This is not speculation; it is protection from currency debasement” - The closing line reiterates the author's contention that actions by investors are a rational response to protect against what they see as the erosion of currency value, a common argument in libertarian discourse that values the preservation of purchasing power and criticizes fiat currency policies.

Overall, the specific choice of words such as ""monetary insanity,"" ""currency destruction,"" and ""currency debasement,"" along with the emphasis on the role of central banks in causing inflation, suggests the author is advocating a political ideology that values limited government intervention in the economy, potentially aligning with libertarian or conservative economic thought."
infowars,Economy,"A recent essay on the Mises Wire triggered quite a bit of discussion among a group of Austrian school economists.

Paul H. Kupiec and Alex J. Pollock’s “Who Owns Federal Reserve Losses and How Will They Impact Monetary Policy?” became the focal point for a wide-ranging discussion of monetary issues that got to the heart of our monetary and overall economic future.

The Fed Cannot Go Bankrupt

The article itself is a fairly straightforward explanation of how the Fed works, and provides several options that the Fed might pursue in a rising interest rate environment. The authors contend that the Fed has intervened itself into a corner, where losses probably will increase as the Fed raises rates. David Howden opined that this might not happen, as the Fed will roll over its mostly short-term, low-yielding investments into higher-earning assets, which will tend to protect its net interest income and provide an operating profit. Furthermore, the Fed is not required to mark its low-yielding investments to market. Were it required to do so, the Fed’s true financial weakness would be revealed.

The Fed Ignores the Rule of Law

But what can or will be done about it? Early in their essay, Kupiec and Pollock conclude that nothing will be done, despite the provisions of the law that created the Fed over one hundred years ago. The losses will not go away; they simply will be transferred to the unwitting public through loss of purchasing power. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

The “innovation” in accounting policies centers around the Fed’s newly minted “deferred asset” account, to which underwater assets will be transferred. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

If the Fed were subject to the rule of law, either it would have stopped money printing years ago or its creditors would have forced it to close its doors. Yet the rule of law is completely ignored. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

The Keynesians running our economic life may be reassured that the Fed cannot fail in a technical sense, but the public should be appalled. The continual monetization of the federal budget threatens the complete loss of the dollar’s purchasing power—to wit, a Weimar Republic–style catastrophe.

Today’s monetary leaders fail to understand the true nature of money and, therefore, cannot conceive that there are real consequences to their outlandish irresponsibility in monetizing government debt and brazenly dismissing the rule of law. As the facilitator of monetary debasement, borne by the general public, the Fed fosters the destruction of societal capital.

The federal government does not have to answer to the law nor the public for its irresponsible and destructive spending. The purpose of insolvency is to force an institution, whether public or private, to stop destroying capital. Austrian school economists understand that capital must be created by hard work, innovation, frugality, and, most of all, savings. The market allocates scarce capital to those enterprises that create things worth more than those scarce inputs.

The Solution Is a “Return to Sound Money”

In 1953 Ludwig von Mises added a relatively short final chapter to his 1913 masterpiece The Theory of Money and Credit. Chapter 3 of part 4 is titled “The Return to Sound Money.” It is as relevant today as it was almost seventy years ago. Mises explains how the US in particular could anchor the dollar to its gold reserves. The Fed would be eliminated and replaced by little more than a board that would monitor all dollars to make sure they are backed 100 percent by gold.

Mises was a master in presenting what self-serving Keynesian scholars try to hide in a fog of deception; i.e., that money can and should be subject to the rule of law, as are all other economic goods in society. I daresay that there is no single reform that comes closer to fostering peace, freedom, and prosperity than a “return to sound money.”","A recent essay published on the Mises Wire has sparked discussions among economists regarding the current and future implications of Federal Reserve policies.

The essay ""Who Owns Federal Reserve Losses and How Will They Impact Monetary Policy?"" by Paul H. Kupiec and Alex J. Pollock has provoked a debate over critical monetary issues. This conversation encompasses various perspectives on how the Federal Reserve may navigate the complexities of a changing interest rate landscape.

The essay provides insight into the workings of the Federal Reserve and speculates on what actions it might take in response to increasing interest rates. It is suggested that while the Fed is likely to see increased costs associated with higher interest rates, it has strategies available to manage its portfolio in a way that could mitigate such losses. It is noted by David Howden that the Federal Reserve might invest in higher-yielding assets, thus preserving its net interest income along with its profitability, and it is also not obligated to mark its low-yielding investments to market.

The conversation moves to considerations about the effects of Federal Reserve losses and how these might influence the economy. The essay brings attention to a new accounting approach with the creation of a ""deferred asset"" account, which will be used for certain financial entries.

The examination of the Federal Reserve's role in the economy includes discussions on the monetization of debts and what this means for fiscal policy and the stability of the currency. Such discussions touch upon questions about how government financial strategies might affect the value of the currency and, by extension, the economy at large.

Lastly, the essay refers to historic literature, specifically Ludwig von Mises' ""The Theory of Money and Credit,"" which includes a proposition for anchoring the currency to gold reserves. The work contemplates scenarios where monetary policy could be adjusted to reflect a different approach to currency valuation, without expressly advocating for a particular system.

The range of opinions and analyses presented in the discussions around the Federal Reserve’s policy options showcases the complexity and importance of monetary policy to the larger economic environment.","This article contains language and rhetoric that suggests an underlying political ideology aligned with the principles of Austrian economics, which emphasizes a free-market approach, minimal government intervention, and skepticism toward central banking, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed). Here are specific examples:

1. ""triggered quite a bit of discussion among a group of Austrian school economists.""

2. ""The Fed has intervened itself into a corner...""
   - The use of ""intervened"" suggests that the Fed's active role in the economy is undesirable, a view commonly held by Austrian economists who prefer less intervention.

3. ""The losses will not go away; they simply will be transferred to the unwitting public through loss of purchasing power.""
   - This statement frames the Fed's actions as clandestine and harmful to the public, which indicates a belief in the negative consequences of central bank policies on the common citizen, a view aligned with Austrian economics.

4. ""If the Fed were subject to the rule of law, either it would have stopped money printing years ago or its creditors would have forced it to close its doors.""
   - The phrase ""rule of law"" suggests that the Fed operates outside normal legal or economic constraints, criticizing its actions from a standpoint that values strict legal adherence and possibly a more laissez-faire economic approach.

5. ""Keynesians running our economic life... the Fed cannot fail in a technical sense...""
   - The derogatory reference to ""Keynesians running our economic life"" expresses disapproval of Keynesian economics, which generally advocates for more active government intervention - a stance opposed to the Austrian school's perspective.

6. ""complete loss of the dollar’s purchasing power—to wit, a Weimar Republic–style catastrophe.""
   - Invoking the Weimar Republic implies extreme outcomes resulting from monetary policy, a reference that intends to stoke fear about the current direction of monetary policy and paints it as reckless.

7. ""Austrian school economists understand that capital must be created by hard work, innovation, frugality, and, most of all, savings.""
   - This line emphasizes core Austrian economic principles, suggesting a bias towards their ideology which values savings and organic economic growth over what they perceive as artificial manipulation by the central bank.

8. ""The Solution Is a 'Return to Sound Money'""
   - The term ""sound money"" is a hallmark of Austrian economic advocacy for a currency backed by a tangible commodity like gold, indicative of a preference for a gold standard over fiat currency used by modern monetary systems.

9. ""Mises was a master in presenting what self-serving Keynesian scholars try to hide...""
   - By praising Ludwig von Mises and criticizing ""self-serving Keynesian scholars,"" the author aligns themselves with Austrian ideology and implies that Keynesian views are deceptive.

10. ""there is no single reform that comes closer to fostering peace, freedom, and prosperity than a 'return to sound money.'""
    - The conclusion associates the Austrian economic idea of sound money with the ideals of ""peace, freedom, and prosperity,"" indicating that the author's ideology holds that their viewpoints are the key to achieving these societal goals."
infowars,Election,"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre [KJP] told the American people during a Wednesday press conference that Joe Biden sees Trump supporters as an “extreme threat to democracy.“

“The president thinks there’s an extremist threat to our democracy. The president has been clear as he can be on that particular piece when we talk about our democracy, when we talk about our freedoms,” Jean-Pierre said. “The way he sees it is the MAGA Republicans are the most energized part of the Republican party. This is an extreme threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.”

Continuing, the press secretary laughably said, “They [MAGA Republicans] just don’t respect the rule of law. You’ve heard that from the president and they are pursuing an agenda that takes away people’s rights, which is what the president said last week, you all heard him. This is what the president said yesterday and that’s what he’s going to continue to say. The president is not going to shy away to call out what he clearly sees is happening in this country. Again, MAGA Republicans are this extreme part of their party and that is just facts.”

Later during the Wednesday press conference, Jean-Pierre named several GOP politicians and claimed they publicly support violence.

Each instance KJP referred to was either extremely exaggerated or outright false.

After calling tens of millions of American voters violent extremists, the White House Press Secretary dodged a question from a reporter about how Biden would differentiate “ultra MAGA” folks from the average GOP voter, suddenly saying she “can’t talk about voters from here.”

The Democrat Party is consistently choosing to promote the narrative that Republican voters and politicians are the enemy of Democrat voters as Joe Biden also called GOP voters “semi-fascists” last week.

The current chair of the Democratic National Committee Jaime Harrison defended the comments on CBS News this week.

The clearly divisive and hypocritical rhetoric was slammed online.

Breitbart podcast host Joel Pollack called on Jean-Pierre to “resign” for the “inflammatory message.”

The Media Research Center sarcastically asked, “Does Joe Biden recognize the rule of law for his son, Hunter?”

“Way to win the goodwill of people who disagree with you, Karine,” the Daily Caller wrote.","White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre spoke to the public in a Wednesday press conference, addressing President Joe Biden's concerns about certain heightened political tensions within the country.

“The president believes there is a considerable challenge to our democracy that we must confront. He has consistently been clear about the nature of this challenge when discussing the foundations of our democratic system and the rights we hold dear,” Jean-Pierre stated. She noted that the President identifies a particular energy within a segment of the Republican party that presents challenges to democratic principles and civil liberties.

Jean-Pierre continued by explaining that, according to the President, there are individuals within this group who are perceived to be dismissive of established legal norms and are advancing an agenda that the President finds concerning, given its potential impact on individual rights. She reaffirmed the President’s commitment to openly addressing these issues as part of his administration's discourse.

In the same Wednesday press conference, Jean-Pierre also commented on GOP politicians, suggesting that some of their statements have appeared to lend support to contentious behavior.

She faced challenging questions regarding the distinction between mainstream Republican voters and those whom the President has called into question. When pressed to elaborate, Jean-Pierre responded by indicating the limitations placed on her role regarding discussions about voters.

The comments in question have inspired vigorous dialogue among political figures and generated robust reactions throughout online platforms and media commentary. Opinions and critical responses to the administration’s statements span a wide range, reflecting the multiplicity of views held by the American electorate.

Jaime Harrison, the current chair of the Democratic National Committee, supported the President's comments and addressed related concerns in a recent interview on CBS News.

Responses to what has been portrayed as contentious rhetoric varied across media outlets, with some commentators and news organizations pointing to the potential implications of such discourse on political unity and collaboration.","The language and rhetoric used in this article suggest an underlying conservative or right-leaning political ideology. Here are specific instances that point towards this perspective:

1. **Brief quote:** ""Joe Biden sees Trump supporters as an 'extreme threat to democracy.'""
   **Explanation:** The phrase ""extreme threat to democracy"" is quoted as a direct statement from the White House Press Secretary about Trump supporters. This label positions the use of 'extreme' as a strong ideological stance against one political group, suggesting bias in the reporting by portraying Biden's viewpoint as aggressive or divisive.

2. **Brief quote:** ""The press secretary laughably said...""
   **Explanation:** The word ""laughably"" is used to discredit the press secretary's statements as absurd or not to be taken seriously, reflecting the article's bias by suggesting that her claims are inherently ridiculous without providing factual counterarguments.

3. **Brief quote:** ""Each instance KJP referred to was either extremely exaggerated or outright false.""
   **Explanation:** This phrase accuses the Press Secretary of lying or embellishing the truth, indicating the article's alignment with an ideology that is critical of the current administration and supportive of Trump-aligned perspectives.

4. **Brief quote:** ""After calling tens of millions of American voters violent extremists...""
   **Explanation:** The language here suggests that the White House is unfairly and incorrectly labeling a large segment of the American population, implying the author's disagreement with such characterizations. This appeals to a sense of unjust persecution common within partisan rhetoric, particularly on the right in the context of disputes with left-leaning political figures.

5. **Brief quote:** ""The Democrat Party is consistently choosing to promote the narrative...""
   **Explanation:** Referring to the ""Democrat Party"" rather than the ""Democratic Party"" is a common linguistic tactic used by conservatives to subtly cast the party in a negative light. The phrase also alleges a deliberate strategy by Democrats to vilify Republicans, positioning them as the 'enemy,' which claims a victimization of the Republican voter base.

6. **Brief quote:** ""The clearly divisive and hypocritical rhetoric was slammed online.""
   **Explanation:** The use of ""clearly"" suggests that it is an indisputable fact that the rhetoric is divisive and hypocritical, though what is considered divisive or hypocritical is often subjective and typically aligns with the bias of the writer or their intended audience.

7. **Brief quote:** ""Breitbart podcast host Joel Pollack...""
   **Explanation:** Mentioning Breitbart, a publication known for its conservative viewpoint, without balancing with sources from other parts of the political spectrum, adds a layer of right-leaning bias through the choice of sources that the article treats as authoritative.

8. **Brief quote:** ""The Media Research Center sarcastically asked...""
   **Explanation:** The sarcasm attributed to the Media Research Center, an organization known for its conservative viewpoint, challenges the administration's integrity and aligns with the broader conservative critique of perceived double standards in the treatment of legal issues by Democrats.

These instances cumulatively suggest that the article comes from a position that is critical of the current Democratic administration and supportive of conservative or Republican viewpoints. This critique is framed in a way that implies that the administration's actions and rhetoric are not just politically motivated, but also hypocritical and unfair to conservative Americans."
infowars,Election,"A satirical Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) re-election video posted by conservative podcaster Benny Johnson has been shared online more times than Pelosi’s actual post announcing her decision to run for office once again.

Pinned to the top of the Democrat congresswoman’s Twitter page is a video of Pelosi announcing she’s running for re-election.

“While we have made progress much more needs to be done to improve people’s lives,” Pelosi wrote. “This election is crucial: nothing less is at stake than our Democracy. But we don’t agonize, we organize. I am running for re-election to Congress to deliver For The People and defend Democracy.”

Footage of the decaying state of California was added to the background of the announcement, with Johnson titling the new clip, “Accurate Nancy Pelosi re-election video.”

As Pelosi panders to the liberal mob in the re-election declaration, viewers can see images of the poop-filled streets of San Francisco, mass looting of retail shops, heroin needles, rampant homelessness and more.

After the mock re-election video surpassed Pelosi’s original post in shares, Johnson captured it with a screenshot and posted, “LOL REKT.”

At the time of writing this article, Benny Johnson’s post has 4.5k retweets while Pelosi’s pinned video has 4.2k.

On Pelosi’s Twitter page, a video is pinned showcasing her announcement to run for another term as a member of Congress.

“While we have made progress much more needs to be done to improve people’s lives,” Pelosi commented. “This election is crucial: nothing less is at stake than our Democracy. I am running for re-election to Congress to deliver For The People and defend Democracy.”

In the edited version of this announcement, footage showcasing various issues in California has been included in the background. The creator of the video referred to it as the “Accurate Nancy Pelosi re-election video.”

During the announcement video, scenes are shown including the streets of San Francisco and its challenges, incidents of theft from retail stores, the prevalence of drug paraphernalia, and the issue of homelessness.

After the edited re-election video received more shares than Pelosi's original video, the person behind the edit shared a screenshot of the statistics and commented on the unexpected level of engagement.

At the time this article was written, the edited post has received 4.5k retweets and Pelosi's original announcement video has 4.2k.

Also of note is a recent broadcast by a well-known commentator discussing the upcoming U.S. election.","1. ""satirical Nancy Pelosi re-election video posted by conservative podcaster Benny Johnson""
   - The description of the video as ""satirical"" sets the tone for a critical or mocking approach to Representative Pelosi's candidacy, hinting at conservative disdain for her or her policies.

2. ""panders to the liberal mob""
   - The phrase ""liberal mob"" suggests a conservative viewpoint, implying that liberals act as an unruly or irrational collective. This language is often used by conservatives to describe progressive groups or movements negatively.

3. ""poop-filled streets of San Francisco, mass looting of retail shops, heroin needles, rampant homelessness""
   - The choice to highlight these negative aspects of San Francisco, while Pelosi is speaking, is an attempt to directly associate her and her policies with urban decay and social issues. This selection of imagery aligns with a conservative critique of Democratic governance in cities.

4. ""LOL REKT""
   - The use of online slang (LOL for ""laughing out loud"" and REKT, a misspelling of ""wrecked,"" to signify a form of defeat or embarrassment) suggests a tone of mockery and triumphalism, typical of conservative internet culture, in response to the perceived success of the satirical video over Pelosi's actual announcement.

5. ""Watch a recent Tucker Carlson discussion about the next U.S. election.""
   - The invitation to watch conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, known for his right-leaning and often controversial views, further signals an endorsement of conservative perspectives and a likely alignment with that ideological position.

The language and rhetoric in the article, together with the contextual cues, consistently suggest a conservative bias that is critical of Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party's approach to governance and policy."
infowars,Immigration,"In a hopeful sign of de-escalation, Ukrainian officials said they will meet Russian counterparts at the Belarus border, shortly after Vladimir Putin said he is putting Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert.

In a Facebook post, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine has agreed to talks with Russia on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

“We have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with Russian without prior conditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, in the area of the Pripyat River,” Zelenskiy said. A delegation has already left Kyiv, Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of Zelenskiy’s party, said in televised comments.

The Ukraine foreign minister said that he will go to listen to what Russia has to say and that he will not surrender territory.

The confirmation came after Russia earlier sent a negotiation team to the southeastern Belarusian city of Gomel. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the “Russian delegation is ready for talks, and we are now waiting for the Ukrainians” in the Belarusian city of Homel, per AP.

In response, Zelensky said in a video address that he’s open to talks, but not in Belarus which he said was not neutral territory.

“If there had been no aggressive action from your territory, we could talk in Minsk … other cities can be used as the venue for talks,” Zelensky said. “We want peace, we want to meet, we want an end to the war,” he added. “Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku — we proposed all that to the Russian side. Any other city would work for us, too, in a country from whose territory rockets are not being fired.”

While an encouraging development, this won’t be the first time that the two nations have exchanged proposals for a potential ceasefire, only to see the plans collapse.

The news helped push the weekend IG spread market for the “weekend Dow” higher by about 150 points although it remains well in the red from Friday’s close.

Meanwhile, in the latest battlefield developments, overnight Russian forces on Sunday attacked Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city. Much of Europe has closed its airspace to Russia, and offers of military assistance continue to flow in.

Also overnight, Western nations agreed to exclude some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system, used for trillions of dollars worth of transactions between banks around the world, further isolating Russia’s economy and financial system.","Ukrainian officials announced plans to meet with Russian representatives at the Belarus border, following a statement by Vladimir Putin about Russia’s nuclear forces being placed on a heightened state of alert.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy shared via Facebook that Ukraine has consented to dialogue with Russia along the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

“The Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russians without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelenskiy stated. Members of the Ukrainian delegation, including Fedir Venislavskyi from Zelenskiy's political party, have already departed from Kyiv, with Venislavskyi confirming their movement in broadcasted comments.

Ukraine’s foreign minister expressed intentions to hear Russia's propositions, emphasizing a focus on maintaining Ukraine's current borders.

Following Russia's decision to send negotiators to Gomel, a southeastern city in Belarus, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov conveyed that the Russian team is prepared for discussions in Homel, awaiting their Ukrainian counterparts.

In a separate video address, Zelensky articulated his willingness to engage in discussions, but expressed a preference for a location other than Belarus, which he did not view as a neutral ground.

Zelensky proposed alternative options for the venue, saying, “Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku — we offered all these locations to the Russian side. We are open to other cities as well, provided they are not involved in hostilities.”

These negotiations represent an ongoing effort to achieve a ceasefire, although previous attempts have not been successful.

The announcement has influenced financial markets, with the “weekend Dow” spread market experiencing a 150-point boost, though still down from the previous Friday’s close.

In the meantime, significant military activity continues on the ground, with Russian forces initiating attacks in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Concurrently, several Western nations have decided to bar certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international banking system, which has implications for global financial transactions and the Russian economy.","This article presents information in a relatively neutral tone, reporting on events related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, there are subtle elements in the language and choices made by the author that could hint at an underlying political bias or viewpoint. Here are specific instances:

1. ""In a hopeful sign of de-escalation"" – The phrase sets an optimistic tone regarding discussions between Ukraine and Russia, potentially indicating a bias toward peace and diplomacy.

2. ""President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said"" – Referring to Zelenskiy with his presidential title confers legitimacy and respects Ukraine's sovereignty, signaling a bias in favor of the Ukrainian government.

3. ""without prior conditions"" – This phrase implies a certain level of openness and flexibility on the Ukrainian side, which might suggest a positive bias towards Ukraine's approach to the negotiations.

4. ""he will not surrender territory"" – The use of the word ""surrender"" evokes a strong stance and determination from the Ukrainian foreign minister, framing Ukraine as resilient.

5. ""the Ukrainian delegation will meet with Russian"" – The omission of a descriptive term such as ""officials"" or ""representatives"" after ""Russian"" dehumanizes the Russian side to some extent, which could subtly indicate a less sympathetic view toward the Russian position.

6. ""putting Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert"" – The mention of this fact creates a sense of alarm and might invoke fear, portraying Russia as aggressive and potentially irrational.

7. ""not in Belarus which he said was not neutral territory"" – This suggests that Belarus is seen as an ally of Russia, casting Belarus and by extension Russia, in a negative light by implying complicity or support for aggression.

8. ""Much of Europe has closed its airspace to Russia"" – The phrase ""Much of Europe"" shows a continental response against Russia, suggesting solidarity with Ukraine.

9. ""offers of military assistance continue to flow in"" – The language here indicates a global willingness to support Ukraine, portraying the country in a sympathetic light.

10. ""excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system"" – This indicates punitive actions taken by Western nations against Russia, potentially hinting at approval of these sanctions.

11. ""further isolating Russia’s economy and financial system"" – The use of ""isolating"" might convey support for the measures designed to pressure Russia into de-escalation.

While the article aims to inform, the specific word choices and context provided subtly suggest a bias in favor of Ukraine and against Russian actions. The language used often invokes sympathy for the Ukrainian position and a critical view of Russia's role in the conflict."
infowars,Immigration,"Update (1500ET): While in a normal world this would be beyond satire and ridicule, it is perhaps of no surprise whatsoever that the blame for instigation of the “Freedom Convoy” is already being placed on so-called ‘Russian actors’…

“…given Canada’s support of Ukraine… I don’t know it it’s far-fetched to ask but there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows… perhaps even instigating it…”

As Brian Lilley writes at The Toronto Sun, “the media in this country is not acting as a neutral observer and conduit for news on this matter, most have decided the trucker convoy is the enemy and are treating it as such. Watch any of the news networks or, more importantly, read the Twitter accounts of supposedly objective journalists, or listen to the contempt in their voices as they ask questions to see that they have clearly taken sides.”

The propaganda seems to have reached some, but not others…

In other news, while Trudeau hides in isolation, the Premier of Saskatchewan, a Canadian province that borders the US, calls for an end of the cross-border ban on unvaccinated truckers.

The world’s largest truck convoy rolled into Canada’s capital, Ottawa, late Friday night and continues today to stage a protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cross-border vaccine mandates (or as some call it: medical tyranny).

The so-called “Freedom Convoy” – coming from all corners of Canada and even the US, has been traveling all week and is leading the charge in a massive demonstration against government overreach. Truckers from around the world are uniting and staging protests of their own.

As Enrico Trigoso reports at The Epoch Times, Brian Von D, the administrator at “Convoy to DC 2022” announced that they will “join forces” to ride from California to Washington, adding that “America is next.”

He added that dates and planned routes would be released soon on a website and various social media platforms, and a GoFundMe page would only be released on their CONVOY TO DC 2022 Facebook page.

The Parliamentary Protective Service expects as many as 10,000 protesters this weekend in Ottawa, but that figure could be significantly higher. A day ago, we noted 50,000 trucks in a 70km (43.5 miles) long convoy are headed to the capital.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the Freedom Convoy is “the largest parade of trucks” ever in the world.

The trucker convoy has been arriving in the capital for the past 12 hours. Additional waves of the convoy will arrive later this afternoon.

Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau called the convoy a “small fringe minority” of those who “do not represent the views of Canadians.” Judging by the pictures and videos so far, Trudeau is a liar, and a revolt is underway in the country. Corporate media and government have spent the better part of the week downplaying the convoy ( because they are scared).

On Friday, Trudeau told the Canadian Press that he was worried about the protest turning violent. Organizers of the event have told truckers and anyone else participating in the demonstration to remain peaceful.

CBC said Trudeau and his family left downtown Ottawa on Saturday morning (due to close contact with someone infected with COVID – although he tested negative and triple-jabbed) as the trucker convoy descended on the area. The local news said he left town due to security concerns.

The convoy is expected to bring parts of the metro area to a standstill and block roads in front of parliament until lawmakers repeal a vaccine mandate for truckers hauling freight across the border.

Despite Trudeau calling the protest “small,” Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly said they planned a “massive” demonstration on Friday.","Update (1500ET): Reports have surfaced implying that foreign influence could be a contributing factor in the mobilization of the ""Freedom Convoy,"" considering Canada’s support of Ukraine. Questions are being raised about the possibility of external parties having a role in the escalation of the protests.

As Brian Lilley at The Toronto Sun observes, there is a perspective among some observers that the media coverage of the trucker convoy could be seen as biased. The media's portrayal and the questions posed by journalists have sparked discussions about their role and viewpoint in this event.

The reaction to these developments has been mixed among different groups.

In related developments, the Premier of Saskatchewan has called for the lifting of the cross-border ban on unvaccinated truckers while Prime Minister Justin Trudeau remains in isolation.

A large truck convoy has arrived in Ottawa to voice their opposition to cross-border vaccine mandates for truckers. Participants of the convoy have journeyed from various parts of Canada, and there are reports of international support for their cause.

According to The Epoch Times, American supporters are planning to organize a similar convoy from California to Washington, with detailed information to be shared through a dedicated website and social media platforms.

The anticipation for the size of this protest in Ottawa is substantial, with estimates suggesting thousands of participants. The convoy has been characterized by the Guinness Book of World Records as ""the largest parade of trucks.""

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described the convoy as a ""small fringe minority"" that does not reflect the majority of Canadian views, while others argue that the size of the convoy indicates significant support. The protesters have been urged by organizers to maintain peace throughout the demonstration.

Reportedly, Trudeau and his family have vacated downtown Ottawa as the protests drew closer, with official statements citing contact with a COVID-19 case—despite testing negative.

Expectations are that the convoy could disrupt traffic and affect the daily operations in the city, with Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly suggesting plans are in place to manage a large-scale demonstration.","1. ""in a normal world this would be beyond satire and ridicule""
   - This phrase suggests an underlying belief that the current world is abnormal or senseless, hinting at a conservative or libertarian viewpoint that may see recent world events (like protests and government reactions) as disproportionate or absurd.
   
2. ""so-called ‘Russian actors’""
   - Labeling potential foreign influences this way, with quotation marks around ""Russian actors,"" implies skepticism about their involvement and criticizes attempts to blame external entities. This reflects a common rhetoric from conservative ideologies that may dismiss such claims as distractions or conspiracy theories.
   
3. ""the trucker convoy is the enemy""
   - The author claims that the media have decided the convoy is the enemy, which implies a belief that the media unfairly targets particular groups. It can indicate a viewpoint that is defensive of the convoy’s aims and distrustful of mainstream media, which often aligns with populist or right-wing perspectives.
   
4. ""Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cross-border vaccine mandates (or as some call it: medical tyranny).""
   - The inclusion of the term ""medical tyranny"" introduces a pejorative character to the vaccine mandates, suggesting a libertarian or right-wing belief in individual freedoms over government health mandates.

5. ""government overreach""
   - This phrase indicates an ideology that is opposed to what they perceive as excessive government control, which is often associated with conservative or libertarian standpoints.
   
6. ""a small fringe minority"" vs. ""Trudeau is a liar, and a revolt is underway""
   - By contrasting Trudeau's statement with the assertion of a ""revolt"" and calling Trudeau a liar, the language indicates a viewpoint supportive of the protest and critical of the government, a stance typically found in populist or right-leaning ideologies.
   
7. ""Corporate media and government have spent the better part of the week downplaying the convoy (because they are scared).""
   - Claiming that media and government are intentionally downplaying the event ""because they are scared"" suggests a narrative of powerful entities conspiring against grassroots movements, a common theme in anti-establishment or libertarian thought.

Each of these instances showcases specific wording choices and framing that provide clues to an underlying political ideology that leans towards a populist, conservative, or libertarian perspective. The language used throughout the article indicates a suspicion of government motives, a defense of the protest actions, and criticism of the media, all of which are characteristic of these ideological viewpoints."
infowars,Police,"A woman was arrested after allegedly stealing a police car and crashing it into a tree in Missouri this week, according to reports.

The wild incident unfolded on Sunday in Velda Village Hills, located in St. Louis County.

Authorities were alerted about a woman behaving erratically while possibly under the influence of unknown substances, KMOV reports.

“She just asked if she could sit down for a moment to get herself together,” said local resident Scharell Houston.

“Then when she got up she was trying to go into people’s houses and go into people’s cars.”

Officers were attempting to comfort and assess the shoeless woman while waiting for EMS when the situation spiraled out of control.

Body cam footage and video shot by a witness show what transpired.

“Listen you’re not in trouble so just relax,” an officer tells Brown as she squats near a tree.

Suddenly, she can be seen running away, circling around a patrol car, and jumping into the driver’s seat.

Officers frantically pull the door open as the vehicle takes off down the street.

The car slams into a tree before the suspect throws it in reverse and crashes into another tree.

Brown was apprehended at the scene and admitted to a mental health facility for evaluation, STL Today reports.

On Monday, she was charged with felony counts of property damage and stealing a motor vehicle.","A woman was taken into custody after taking a police car and subsequently crashing it into a tree in Missouri this week, according to reports.

The incident occurred on Sunday in Velda Village Hills, a community within St. Louis County.

Local authorities received reports of a woman displaying unusual behavior and believed she may have been under the influence of some substance, KMOV reports.

“She just asked if she could sit down for a moment to gather herself,” reported Scharell Houston, a resident of the area.

“After that, she started trying to enter people’s houses and vehicles.”

Police were on the scene to provide assistance and conduct an evaluation of the woman, who did not have any shoes, as they awaited the arrival of EMS when the situation took an unexpected turn.

Videos captured by body cameras and a bystander show the sequence of events.

An officer is heard telling the woman, “Listen, you're not in trouble, just relax,” as she is next to a tree.

She is then seen abruptly running, circling a police car, and entering the driver's seat.

Police tried to intervene as she drove away, but the car soon hit a tree. The vehicle then reversed, striking another tree.

The woman, later identified as Brown, was detained at the site and was taken to a mental health facility for evaluation, per STL Today.

Following the incident, Brown faced felony charges including damage to property and theft of a motor vehicle on Monday.","From the description and language provided in the article, there is no clear evidence of a strong underlying political ideology. The article seems to stick to reporting facts about a specific criminal incident with a neutral tone. However, there are a couple of instances where one could argue that certain phrasings may subtly lean towards certain perspectives:

1. ""A woman was arrested after allegedly stealing a police car and crashing it into a tree in Missouri this week, according to reports.""
   - The use of the word ""allegedly"" indicates a commitment to legal objectivity and due process since the woman has been accused but not yet proven guilty in a court of law. This is a standard journalistic practice, rather than an indication of political bias or ideology.

2. ""Authorities were alerted about a woman behaving erratically while possibly under the influence of unknown substances.""
   - The phrase ""behaving erratically while possibly under the influence of unknown substances"" suggests a possible health or social concern without assigning blame or taking a judgmental tone. This could reflect a more empathetic view towards individuals who may be dealing with substance abuse issues or mental health crises.

3. ""Officers were attempting to comfort and assess the shoeless woman while waiting for EMS when the situation spiraled out of control.""
   - This description could be seen as a neutral depiction of police attempting to provide care, avoiding any accusatory language toward law enforcement or the woman involved. It does not appear to take a stance on police procedures or the individual's behavior.

4. ""On Monday, she was charged with felony counts of property damage and stealing a motor vehicle.""
   - The article concludes with a factual report on the charges that have been filed, without offering an opinion on the criminal justice system or the appropriateness of the charges. The lack of editorializing keeps it ideologically neutral.

Overall, the article is mostly factual and uses standard journalistic practices aimed at reporting events without overt bias or ideological slant. Any analysis of political ideology would be speculative without further context or patterns of language use across a broader array of articles from the same source."
infowars,Police,"Democrat Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs looks like a total fool after jumping to conclusions and insinuating her GOP challenger Kari Lake incited someone to vandalize her campaign headquarters.

On Wednesday, the Hobbs campaign issued an official statement revealing its headquarters had been broken into before telling voters “Kari Lake and her allies have been spreading dangerous misinformation and inciting threats against anyone they see fit.”

“The threats against Arizonans attempting to exercise their constitutional rights and their attacks on elected officials are the direct result of a concerted campaign of lies and intimidation. It won’t work,” the Hobbs statement added.

The Drudge Report ran a headline reading, “Hobbs Blasts Kari Lake for ‘Inciting Threats’ After Campaign HQ Burglarized…”

On Thursday, CNN reporter Kate Sullivan asked Kari Lake about the Hobbs campaign headquarters robbery and if she had a response to the Hobbs team insinuating she was responsible.

“That is absolutely absurd,” Lake answered. “And, are you guys buying that? Are you really buying that? Because this sounds like a Jussie Smollet part two. So, you’re going to drag the American people through something like this?”

She continued, “Obviously, you don’t want to cover the real story today, which we are up eleven percent in the polls and you want to distract the people with an old story. I can’t believe she would blame my amazing people or blame me for something like that. I don’t even know where her campaign office is, I’m assuming it’s in a basement somewhere because that’s where she’s been campaigning.”

Later on Thursday, Phoenix police announced the arrest of 36-year-old illegal alien Daniel Mota Dos Reis in connection with the Hobbs campaign headquarters break-in.

Dos Reis was recognized by an officer viewing security camera footage of the Hobbs HQ theft because the suspect was arrested previously that same day for a different burglary.

The situation is ironic on many levels, with one being that the man is illegal and Kari Lake is strong and outspoken about strengthening the border while Hobbs is weak on immigration.

It’s also ironic because the homeless illegal immigrant was released from police custody hours after committing a separate crime thanks to soft-on-crime Democrat policies like the ones supported by Hobbs.

Lastly, in the most shocking example of irony, the suspect allegedly describes himself on Facebook as a pro-mask “Democrat,” according to Western Journal.

Dos Reis was re-arrested and booked on one count of third-degree burglary in relation to the Hobbs campaign HQ incident.

The Katie Hobbs campaign is giving Democrat Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman’s campaign a run for its money when it comes to the most disastrous political attempt in recent American history.","The Arizona gubernatorial race intensified when candidate Katie Hobbs' campaign headquarters was burglarized, leading to strong statements from both camps. The Hobbs campaign released a statement addressing the break-in, where they mentioned concerns about the political climate and the potential impact on Arizonan voters and officials.

The following day, CNN journalist Kate Sullivan questioned Kari Lake about the incident and whether she had any comments regarding the insinuations made by the Hobbs team. Lake dismissed the accusations as unfounded, highlighting her campaign's performance and questioning why the media was focusing on the burglary.

Later that week, Phoenix police apprehended 36-year-old Daniel Mota Dos Reis in connection to the burglary at Hobbs' campaign office. He was recognized from security footage by an officer who had also arrested him earlier that day for another crime. Dos Reis underwent a subsequent arrest and booking for third-degree burglary concerning the incident with the Hobbs campaign.

The case drew additional attention due to Dos Reis's immigration status and past criminal activity, elements that fed into the larger debate on immigration and law enforcement policies between the two gubernatorial candidates.

The reported dynamics of the race, coupled with the unexpected developments surrounding the burglary, have made this particular political contest a focal point of national media, drawing various opinions on the efficiency and direction of the campaigns involved.","The language in the article suggests a conservative, possibly right-leaning bias, with specific language choices and framing clearly indicating disapproval of Democratic candidate Katie Hobbs and subtle support for her GOP challenger Kari Lake. Here are instances indicating ideological bias:

1. ""looks like a total fool"" - This phrase indicates a lack of respect and an attempt to discredit Katie Hobbs by suggesting she made a significant error in judgment.

2. ""jumping to conclusions and insinuating her GOP challenger incited someone"" - By stating Hobbs 'jumped to conclusions,' the article implies she acted prematurely and without sufficient evidence.

3. ""spreading dangerous misinformation and inciting threats"" - The article quotes the Hobbs campaign but does not provide evidence or context to support the claim, leaving the impression that these are unfounded accusations.

4. ""a concerted campaign of lies and intimidation"" - Using the word ""lies"" suggests that the Hobbs campaign is dishonest in its communication.

5. ""sounds like a Jussie Smollet part two"" - This comparison implies Hobbs is fabricating or exaggerating claims for sympathy or political gain, referencing actor Jussie Smollett’s incident, widely regarded in conservative circles as a hoax.

6. ""up eleven percent in the polls"" - The mentioning of Lake's lead in the polls is strategically placed in Lake’s response to discredit Hobbs’ claims and emphasize her strength as a candidate.

7. ""I’m assuming it’s in a basement somewhere"" - The use of ""basement"" to describe Hobbs' campaigning efforts is likely intended to evoke the pejorative framing often used against Democratic politicians, suggesting they are out of touch or hiding from the public.

8. ""illegal alien Daniel Mota Dos Reis"" - The term ""illegal alien"" is a politically charged phrase often used by conservative media to describe undocumented immigrants unfavorably.

9. ""strong and outspoken about strengthening the border while Hobbs is weak on immigration"" - The contrast between ""strong"" and ""weak"" reveals an ideological leaning that favors strict border policies, which are commonly associated with conservative positions.

10. ""soft-on-crime Democrat policies like the ones supported by Hobbs"" – This phrase suggests Hobbs supports policies that are lenient on crime, echoing a talking point frequently used by conservatives to criticize Democrats.

11. ""most disastrous political attempt"" - The final comment is a sweeping negative judgment of the campaign, assuming it to be a failure without evidence provided in the article itself.

Throughout the article, these word choices and descriptions are indicative of an underlying conservative ideology and a bias against Democrat Katie Hobbs while subtly supporting her Republican opponent."
latimes,Abortion,"Former President Trump — who picked many of his party’s candidates and demanded fealty from them throughout the 2022 midterm campaign — was likely an albatross for the GOP Tuesday night, limiting Republicans’ gains in a midterm election the party expected to dominate.

But if recent history is any guide, Trump’s not going anywhere. The once and likely future presidential candidate is unpopular, but he continues to exercise outsized sway over the Republican base, and could hamstring the party for the next two years and beyond.

As vote-counting continued Wednesday morning, Republicans still had a chance to win both chambers of Congress.

Republicans, though in position to take the House, were sweating it out Wednesday and would need to hold their narrow leads in many of the remaining races to eke out a narrow win. Races in California, where Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has focused attention, could prove decisive.

Paradoxically, a small majority for Republicans would likely give Trump more leverage in Congress, as McCarthy would have to depend on continued support from Trump acolytes such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to maintain power.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson was declared the winner in Wisconsin just before noon Central time, giving Republicans a 49-48 lead with races in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada yet to be decided. With neither candidate in Georgia winning more than 50% of the vote, the race will go to a Dec. 6 runoff like the one that decided Senate control in 2020. A 50-50 split in the Senate would give Democrats control with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote.

The close races for control of Congress defy history. The party that holds the White House usually absorbs big midterm election losses. President Biden’s low approval in polls, fueled by persistent inflation, made sizable Republican gains even more likely, at least on paper.

“Definitely not a Republican wave, that’s for darn sure,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday night on NBC as he predicted a narrow win for Republicans in the Senate.

The combination of Trump’s low popularity, the generally weak general-election performance of the candidates he endorsed, the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection that he inspired and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the right to an abortion this year appear to have drawn Democrats closer than expected. Exit polls conducted by media organizations showed two-thirds of independent voters hold an unfavorable view of the former president.

The latest blow to Republicans: Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a top target in the swing state of Michigan, was declared the winner overnight.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another Democrat, also won her race, defeating Trump-backed candidate Tudor Dixon.

The Michigan results highlight one of the Republican Party’s biggest disappointments. Trump attacked Whitmer relentlessly. Michigan was a key part of the 2016 coalition that propelled Trump’s surprising victory over Hillary Clinton. The state’s historic ties to manufacturing and large population of white working-class voters gave the party hope that the state would trend red as the GOP moved further toward Trump’s brand of populism aimed at capturing economic and cultural anxiety.

But Biden won the state back in 2020, stanching the party’s losses in the upper Midwest.

Michigan voters also approved the most high-profile ballot measure to protect abortion rights, and voters in Kentucky rejected an antiabortion measure that would have added language to the state constitution.

National exit polls this year showed inflation was a top concern among voters. But abortion ranked second. That, and the relative weakness of Trump-backed candidates, helped Democrats stay in the fight.

Many voters appeared willing to swallow their disappointment with Biden. An NBC exit poll showed Democrats narrowly winning — 49% to 45% — among voters who “somewhat disapprove” of Biden’s performance.

The Republicans’ loss of a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, another northern industrial state, could prove the most consequential if Democrats keep the chamber. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz, a television doctor and first-time candidate backed by Trump. Fetterman, still recovering from the effects of a stroke, painted the untested Oz as an elite carpetbagger.

Many of the gubernatorial candidates Trump backed also lost or were in danger of losing as of Wednesday morning.

An exception was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who won reelection in a landslide that permeated races throughout the state. Republicans also performed well in Iowa — winning or leading in almost every major race — while making gains in blue New York, where they appeared likely to win four Democratic-held House seats. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat who led his party’s efforts to keep the House, conceded his own race Wednesday morning to Mike Lawler, a Republican state assemblyman.

DeSantis is seen as Trump’s biggest threat for the 2024 presidential nomination. But even if party leaders prefer DeSantis, Trump has said he will run again. Opinion polls, at least for now, show him as the prohibitive favorite to capture the party’s nomination.

Jason Miller, an advisor to Trump, told the BBC Wednesday morning that he was urging Trump to push back an announcement that he would run again from next week — as he has been teasing — to December, to avoid distracting from a potential Senate runoff in Georgia. But Miller said he remained 100% certain that Trump would run.

“Many of the people who are championing Ron DeSantis for president are the same people who were skeptical of President Trump ever since he came down the escalator in 2015,” Miller said, recalling Trump’s improbable 2016 announcement.

Miller predicted that Trump would “have his hands full” but ultimately win the nomination again.","In the 2022 midterm elections, Former President Trump supported several GOP candidates and remained engaged in the campaign process. His continued involvement raises questions about its impact on the party's performance.

As the results of the election continued to come in, it appeared that Republicans had the possibility of capturing both chambers of Congress. In close races, the outcome in states like California was anticipated to be crucial, where GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had been active.

With a potential slim majority in Congress, individual Republican members could gain more influence over legislative processes.

Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson secured a win, contributing to a 49-48 lead for the Republicans with key races in Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada undecided. In Georgia, the election was poised for a runoff, recalling similar scenarios in previous elections.

The tight races across the country challenged the historical norm where the incumbent president's party often faces losses in midterm elections. Despite economic challenges, the gap in the anticipated gains for the Republicans contrasts with predictions.

Comments from Republican figures like Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged the absence of a strong red wave in the election results.

Voter turnout and political engagement seemed invigorated by various issues, including the responses to the Supreme Court's recent rulings and broader political events. Exit polls indicated that independence harbored unfavorable views of the Former President.

In Michigan, Democratic Representative Elissa Slotkin won her re-election campaign, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer also succeeded in retaining her position, indicating robust competition in states critical to national politics.

The results in Michigan might reflect a shift in voter sentiment from prior elections, amidst ongoing discussions of economic and social policies. Moreover, in that state and elsewhere, ballot measures concerning abortion rights attracted significant attention.

Concerns over inflation and healthcare, alongside other policy topics, were prominent in voters' minds. The dynamics witnessed across different campaigns indicate that voters were evaluating a range of factors, including candidates' positions, performance, and party leadership.

Notably, in Pennsylvania, the contest for a Senate seat was closely watched, with Lt. Governor John Fetterman winning against Dr. Mehmet Oz, highlighting the varied success of candidates backed by national figures.

In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis won reelection decisively, influencing various state-level races. Performance trends in states like Iowa and New York suggested shifts in voter preferences, with Republican candidates gaining or leading in key races.

Looking toward future elections, the range of potential nominees for the Republican Presidential nomination appears wide, with figures like DeSantis and Trump being discussed among advisors and the party leadership. The process of selecting a nominee may engage with a diverse set of opinions and strategies within the party.","The article presents a critique of former President Donald Trump's impact on the Republican party, particularly during the 2022 midterm elections. It suggests that Trump's involvement may have been detrimental to the party's performance. The language used provides insight into the author's viewpoint, which seems to lean more against Trump than in support of him. Below are instances that indicate this bias:

1. ""Former President Trump — who picked many of his party’s candidates and demanded fealty from them throughout the 2022 midterm campaign — was likely an albatross for the GOP Tuesday night...""
   - **Context/Meaning:** The use of the word ""albatross"" indicates that Trump is seen as a burden or curse for the GOP, suggesting that his actions and influence were negative rather than positive.

2. ""The once and likely future presidential candidate is unpopular, but he continues to exercise outsized sway over the Republican base...""
   - **Context/Meaning:** By saying Trump is ""unpopular,"" yet still has ""outsized sway,"" the author implies a contradiction or problem within the GOP, where a figure who is not broadly liked still has significant control over the party's direction.

3. ""Paradoxically, a small majority for Republicans would likely give Trump more leverage in Congress...""
   - **Context/Meaning:** The use of ""Paradoxically"" underscores a sense of contradiction and possibly a negative outcome from the author's perspective, suggesting that it is not ideal for Trump to have more influence.

4. ""The combination of Trump’s low popularity, the generally weak general-election performance of the candidates he endorsed, the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection that he inspired and...""
   - **Context/Meaning:** The phrasing here implies a series of failings or negatives associated with Trump, from low popularity to the implication of responsibility for the Jan. 6 insurrection.

5. ""Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another Democrat, also won her race, defeating Trump-backed candidate Tudor Dixon.""
   - **Context/Meaning:** The fact that Whitmer's victory is highlighted as a defeat of a ""Trump-backed candidate"" frames Trump's influence again as a liability rather than an asset.

6. ""The state’s historic ties to manufacturing and large population of white working-class voters gave the party hope that the state would trend red as the GOP moved further toward Trump’s brand of populism aimed at capturing economic and cultural anxiety.""
   - **Context/Meaning:** The articulation of ""Trump’s brand of populism"" suggests a particular ideology that is divisive or leverages anxiety for political gain, which may be seen as a critique.

7. ""Many voters appeared willing to swallow their disappointment with Biden.""
   - **Context/Meaning:** This implies voters chose to vote for Democrats despite any discontent with Biden, potentially seeing the alternative (candidates influenced by Trump) as less desirable.

8. ""Fetterman, still recovering from the effects of a stroke, painted the untested Oz as an elite carpetbagger.""
   - **Context/Meaning:** The article presents this Democratic narrative without counterargument, possibly suggesting sympathy with Fetterman's portrayal of Trump-endorsed Dr. Oz.

9. ""DeSantis is seen as Trump’s biggest threat for the 2024 presidential nomination. But even if party leaders prefer DeSantis, Trump has said he will run again.""
   - **Context/Meaning:** Highlighting a preference for DeSantis among party leaders while noting Trump's insistence on running again positions Trump as potentially going against the perceived best interest of the party.

These instances suggest that the author of the article may harbor a critical view of Trump's role in the GOP and his impact on the party's success in elections. The language used conveys a sense of Trump's influence as problematic and potentially harmful to the Republican party's prospects."
latimes,Abortion,"Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Friday that immediately protects abortion providers in California from liability when caring for patients traveling from areas where the procedure is now banned or access is narrowed.

Assembly Bill 1666 by Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda) will protect providers and patients in California from civil liability judgements based on claims made in antiabortion states. It further cements the state’s efforts to be a “beacon of hope” in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.

Newsom said the law will push back against Republican states that allow private lawsuits against abortion providers and patients. Last year, Texas passed a law that allows private citizens to sue anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“We will in no way shape or form, support, enable, investigate, resource, any of those activities or energies,” Newsom said, adding that the new law is part of a larger package of more than a dozen bills aimed at providing “true sanctuary” for those seeking or providing abortions in the state.

California has been preparing for months for the likelihood that thousands of people would travel to the state from areas of the country where bans are resurrected for the first time since 1973. Various bills and budget proposals are in the works, calling for millions to be set aside for abortion services for the uninsured, workforce programs to increase the number of providers and to assist patients with the cost of traveling from other states.

The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports reproductive health and abortion rights, said 26 states will ban all, or nearly all, abortions now that the landmark case has been overturned.

UCLA’s Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy released a report this month estimating that 8,000 to 16,000 more people will travel to California each year for abortion care. That includes up to 9,400 more people from antiabortion states seeking care in Los Angeles County alone, according to the report.

California law grants anyone of reproductive age “the fundamental right to choose to bear a child or to choose and to obtain an abortion.” That includes minors, who under state law can consent to an abortion without their parents’ knowledge.

The state allows a woman to have an abortion until the point that a physician determines “there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures” or if the procedure is necessary in order to “protect the life or health of the woman.”

State law does not stipulate the exact point in a pregnancy when viability occurs, instead allowing a physician to make that determination based on “good-faith medical judgment.” In most cases, doctors have considered a fetus viable at 24 weeks.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said the state will ensure that patients are provided the reproductive care they need, no matter where they live.

“You have the right to an abortion here,” Bonta said. “You have the right to an abortion before viability without a reason. You have the right to an abortion after viability to protect your life or your health. You have the right to obtain an abortion without parental consent. I will not back down from defending these rights, expanding them and keeping our clinics accessible and safe, because in California, we refuse to turn back the clock and let radical ideologies exert control over your body.”","Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Friday that ensures legal protection for abortion providers in California when attending to patients who come from jurisdictions where the procedure has become restricted or prohibited.

Assembly Bill 1666, authored by Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, is designed to shield both providers and patients from civil liabilities based on judicial decisions arising from states with stricter abortion laws. It also reinforces California's policies in light of recent changes at the federal level regarding abortion legislation.

The new law responds to measures in other states that permit civil lawsuits against those who perform or assist with abortions. For instance, Texas enacted legislation that enables private citizens to initiate legal action against individuals aiding in an abortion past a specified gestational period.

Newsom highlighted that California's law is part of a broader legislative effort aimed at safeguarding abortion access within the state. The government is anticipating an increase in people seeking these services from outside of California, in response to changes in abortion laws elsewhere.

In advance of these expected demographic shifts, California has been developing proposed legislation and budget allocations to support those seeking abortions, especially the uninsured. These initiatives include funding for abortion services and assistance with travel costs for those coming from other states.

The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization focusing on reproductive health, notes that in the wake of recent federal rulings, numerous states are poised to significantly restrict or prohibit abortions.

A recent study by UCLA's Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy estimates an increase in the number of individuals traveling to California for abortion services, including a significant number who may seek care in Los Angeles County.

In California, individuals of reproductive age have the legal right to decide to continue a pregnancy or to seek an abortion. This includes minors who, under current state law, can consent to an abortion without parental notification. The state permits abortion procedures up until the point where a physician assesses that the fetus could likely survive outside the womb without extensive medical intervention, or if continuing the pregnancy would pose a risk to the woman's life or health. The determination of fetal viability is made by medical professionals based on their clinical judgment.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta stated that the state is committed to ensuring that appropriate reproductive care services are available to those who need them, regardless of their place of residence. Bonta affirmed a commitment to uphold these provisions and maintain access to reproductive care facilities.","The language in the article suggests a pro-choice, progressive political ideology in support of abortion rights, largely reflected in the framing and choice of words. Here are specific instances:

1. ""protects abortion providers in California from liability"" - This statement embodies a defensive stance in the face of perceived external threats against abortion providers. It suggests the law acts as a shield for providers, thereby framing them as in need of protection due to the hostility from other areas.

2. ""beacon of hope"" - The use of this phrase implies that California represents a positive and progressive safe haven that contrasts with other areas where access to abortion has been restricted. It is valorizing the state's approach.

3. ""push back against Republican states"" - Characterizing the action as ""push back"" suggests active resistance against what are labeled ""Republican states."" This indicates a partisan divide and positions the states with restrictive abortion laws in opposition to California's approach.

4. ""true sanctuary"" - The term ""sanctuary"" is often associated with refuge and protection, framing California as a protector of rights against restrictive laws elsewhere.

5. ""Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports reproductive health and abortion rights,"" - Referencing the Guttmacher Institute by its stance on reproductive health and abortion rights without mention of opposing or differing views suggests alignment with their perspective.

6. ""the fundamental right to choose"" - The description of reproductive choice as a ""fundamental right"" places this right as inherent and essential, aligning with pro-choice ideology.

7. ""antiabortion states"" - Labeling states with restrictive abortion laws as ""antiabortion"" rather than ""pro-life"" or another term used by opponents of abortion rights indicates a bias toward the pro-choice perspective.

8. ""radical ideologies exert control over your body"" - The use of ""radical ideologies"" to refer to those against abortion rights suggests extremism and frames the issue of control over one’s body as a struggle against such ideologies.

9. ""viability"" and ""extraordinary medical measures"" - The nuanced language surrounding the determination of fetal viability and the conditions for late-term abortions reflects a measured approach consistent with pro-choice advocacy, rather than an absolutist stance.

10. ""will not back down from defending these rights"" - The phrase implies a defensive stance against threats to abortion rights and indicates a commitment to actively supporting these rights.

These instances demonstrate the particular linguistic framing used to convey support for reproductive rights and resistance against opposing, more restrictive views on abortion, typically associated with a progressive or liberal political ideology."
latimes,COVID,"Eleven competitive congressional races in California that could end up determining the balance of power in the House were still too close to call Wednesday.

Congressional campaigns on both sides of the aisle expressed cautious optimism as election officials continue tallying votes, a process that could take weeks.

With the prospect of the House majority on the line, the entire nation may be kept in suspense because of California’s notoriously plodding count — a scenario few expected in the lead-up to election day.

“I guess I’m surprised that it’s kind of coming down to California,” said Paul Mitchell, vice president of the political data analysis firm PDI. “I expected the Republicans to pick up 10 to 12 seats in the House, and that’s before they even got to California.”

In the 41st Congressional District, Democrat Will Rollins was ahead of Rep. Ken Calvert — the longest serving GOP member of California’s congressional delegation — by more than 7,500 votes, with just 37% of the ballots counted as of Wednesday.

Calvert’s past opposition to gay rights may have hurt him among the Coachella Valley’s large LGBTQ community, said Mitchell, which could be a reason why the early results trended toward Rollins, who is gay.

Rollins remains confident, saying in an interview with The Times that “we feel like we’re going to win this one.”

“There’s still a long way to go and we know it’s going to be close, but this is a pretty powerful lead,” he said.

Calvert’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

On Tuesday, chatter of an impending national “red wave” could be heard across the Orange County nightclub where GOP congressional hopeful Scott Baugh and others gathered to await election results.

The mood in the packed club dampened when the results began rolling in, but Baugh, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Katie Porter to represent the 47th Congressional District in Orange County, remained confident.

“Early returns in California as you know always favor the Democrats. How many of you voted on election day?” he asked the crowd as hands shot up. “You’re going to reverse what the results are right now and you’re going to put us in the lead by midnight.”

At midnight, Baugh was trailing Porter by fewer than 1,000 votes. Less than a day later, Porter’s lead had grown slightly to roughly 1,500 votes.

On Wednesday, the mood in Porter’s camp was one of cautious optimism. In 2018, it took 11 days for the race between Porter and Republican Mimi Walters to be called.

“There are still tens of thousands of ballots left to be counted, and our campaign respects Orange County voters and will wait patiently for the results,” said campaign spokesperson Lindsay Reilly.

The popularity of mail-in ballots means that results can frequently take longer in many states, including California, than voters typically expect, said Paul Gronke, a professor of political science and director of the Elections and Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, Ore.

“It’s going to make it particularly difficult this year with results coming in at different rates, and it’s going to open up a window for people to charge malfeasance,” he said.

Still, he added, just because the vote is taking longer to count doesn’t mean there’s something wrong.

In the Central Valley’s 22nd district, Republican Rep. David Valadao was ahead of Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas by about 3,300 votes with just over a third of the vote counted.

In 2018, publications across the state declared Valadao the winner in his bid for reelection against his Democratic challenger. However, ballot counting continued through the rest of November and Valadao conceded the race in early December.

Valadao acknowledged his campaign “always knew this race was going to be tight,” but he’s hopeful about early returns. Salas said he’s waiting patiently for votes to be counted.

The variables and caveats in the Golden State’s midterm races are many, which makes predictions difficult. The upending of traditional voting methods during the pandemic, uncertainty about the state of democracy and even wet weather on election day could be factors.

Heavy rain over the weekend and on election day might have spurred some voters to mail in ballots at the last minute rather than brave the elements to vote in person, Mitchell said.

Recently, more Republicans have been voting in person on election day because conspiracy theories spread by former President Trump and others have made them distrustful of mail ballots. And since the pandemic, more Democrats have turned to vote by mail. Historically, it was the other way around.

The uncertainty and norm-busting is enough to make Mitchell throw up his hands.

“It’s all over the place,” he said. “We don’t know who voted, and at what magnitude.”","Eleven highly contested congressional races in California remain undecided, with the outcomes holding potential implications for which party will control the House. The final result may take additional time to confirm as the state continues its thorough vote-counting process, which can extend for several weeks.

Campaigns for both parties maintain a measure of hope as the count progresses, acknowledging the narrow margins in several districts. Paul Mitchell from PDI remarked on the unexpected central role California is playing in the national results, given pre-election forecasts.

In California's 41st District, Will Rollins has an early lead of more than 7,500 votes over Rep. Ken Calvert, but with just 37% of ballots accounted for. Rollins expressed confidence in maintaining his lead, while Calvert has not commented on the preliminary results.

Scott Baugh, running in the 47th District against Democrat Katie Porter, encouraged supporters at an election night gathering, emphasizing that votes cast on election day could shift the outcome. As it stands, Porter holds a slight advantage, with the understanding that many votes are yet to be counted. Porter's spokesperson Lindsay Reilly underlined their respect for the electoral process and the remaining uncounted votes.

The widespread adoption of mail-in ballots may contribute to the delayed results, according to Paul Gronke of Reed College. He noted the varying paces at which results can arrive and assured that an extended count should not be seen as indicative of issues with the electoral process.

In the 22nd District race, Republican Rep. David Valadao was ahead of Democrat Rudy Salas with about a third of votes tallied. Both campaigns are bracing for a close finish, recalling that in 2018, continued ballot counting led to an outcome that defied initial predictions.

Numerous elements are influencing the dynamics of California's election results. Changes in voting methods amid the pandemic, discussions about democratic processes, and even adverse weather on election day are all factors that may have affected voter turnout and behavior.

Overall, it remains uncertain which party will ultimately gain or retain seats in California until all votes are accounted for, a scenario that underscores the importance of these races for the national political landscape.","Analyzing the article's language and rhetoric to infer underlying political ideology requires looking at particular words, phrases, and the context in which they are used. Here are a few instances where bias or viewpoint might be reflected:

1. ""Eleven competitive congressional races in California that could end up determining the balance of power in the House were still too close to call Wednesday.""
   - This statement is relatively neutral, setting the stage for the importance of the races without any obvious partisan bias.

2. ""With the prospect of the House majority on the line, the entire nation may be kept in suspense because of California’s notoriously plodding count — a scenario few expected in the lead-up to election day.""
   - The phrase ""notoriously plodding count"" suggests a negative view of California's vote-counting process, possibly reflecting frustration with perceived inefficiencies in the system.

3. ""Calvert’s past opposition to gay rights may have hurt him among the Coachella Valley’s large LGBTQ community.""
   - This statement hints at progressive ideology by emphasizing the importance of gay rights and how opposition to these rights could be politically damaging.

4. ""On Tuesday, chatter of an impending national 'red wave' could be heard across the Orange County nightclub...""
   - This is a reference to a commonly held expectation among Republicans (the ""red wave"") and indicates the author is aware of partisan predictions and messaging.

5. ""The mood in the packed club dampened when the results began rolling in, but Baugh... remained confident.""
   - The wording here paints a vivid picture of the event's atmosphere and could be seen as subtle storytelling that aims to humanize the candidates and their supporters.

6. ""Just because the vote is taking longer to count doesn’t mean there’s something wrong.""
   - This is a reassurance that seems to counteract allegations of malfeasance in elections, which could be seen as a dismissal of concerns often raised by conservatives about the integrity of the electoral process.

7. ""Recently, more Republicans have been voting in person on election day because conspiracy theories spread by former President Trump and others have made them distrustful of mail ballots.""
   - The use of the term ""conspiracy theories"" and directly naming former President Trump imply a bias against his claims regarding mail ballots. It suggests that these theories are unfounded and have had a tangible effect on Republican voting behavior.

8. ""And since the pandemic, more Democrats have turned to vote by mail. Historically, it was the other way around.""
   - This statement is merely historical and does not inherently reflect an ideological bias, but it does touch upon how the pandemic has influenced voting patterns, which is a politically charged topic.

In conclusion, while the article does present factual information related to the election, certain choices in language convey subtle nuances that might be interpreted as carrying a slight progressive bias, particularly when discussing voting rights, the integrity of vote-counting, and the portrayal of Trump's influence on Republican voter behavior. However, it's also worth noting that many of the statements are framed in a way that could be seen as either reporting or reflecting broader conversations rather than explicitly endorsing a viewpoint."
latimes,COVID,"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared a state of emergency in California over the spread of the monkeypox virus in order to “bolster the state’s vaccination efforts.”

“California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Newsom said in statement.

Monkeypox is a rare disease similar to smallpox, though usually milder. It is largely spreading among men who have sex with men as well as transgender and nonbinary people, though health officials warn that anyone can contract the virus through direct contact with infectious sores, scabs or body fluids or by touching clothing and bedding used by a person with the virus.

Nearly 800 cases have been confirmed in California, according to the California Department of Public Health’s most recent data as of Thursday. The state reported that 98.3% of those cases were confirmed in men, the majority of whom identify as part of the LGBTQ community.

The proclamation makes it easier for the state to coordinate its response to the outbreak by ordering all state agencies to follow the direction of the Office of Emergency Services and the California Department of Public Health. The order also boosts vaccination efforts by allowing EMS workers to administer vaccines, which remain in short supply.

Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and several other state lawmakers sent a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Monday calling for an emergency budget appropriation of $38.5 million to support local monkeypox testing, vaccination, treatment and outreach for the first 90 days of the outbreak.

“The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it,” Wiener said in a statement after Newsom’s emergency declaration.

Newsom’s office said California has distributed more than 25,000 doses of the vaccine out of a total of 61,000 doses received to date. That total does not include a separate allocation the federal government directed to Los Angeles County.

The governor’s order said the state is “distributing its limited supply of the vaccine to local health jurisdictions based on a formula that considers current monkeypox cases and number of high-risk individuals.”

Those eligible for the vaccine in L.A. County include anyone who had direct contact with someone with monkeypox or attended a high-exposure event. Also eligible under the county’s guidelines are gay and bisexual men and transgender people who visited a commercial sex venue or other venue where they had anonymous sex or sex with multiple partners in the last three weeks, or who were diagnosed with gonorrhea or early syphilis within the last 12 months or are taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis medicine.

The governor’s office said more than 30 facilities and providers across the state are offering treatment for monkeypox, though access to the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat is also limited.

“We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” Newsom said.

Those infected by the virus initially have a fever, aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. Later they develop a rash, usually starting on the face and then spreading, turning into pus-filled sores before healing.

Monkeypox illnesses typically resolve within two to four weeks but can cause severe pain, hospitalization, long-term symptoms and, in rare cases, death.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger urged the county to “draw down all the support available to accelerate the distribution of vaccines and resources to those at risk and suffering from this terrible disease” in response to the governor’s order.

“I will work to ensure we’re doing so quickly and efficiently,” Barger said in a statement. “We don’t have any time to waste.”

An investigation into the first case of monkeypox in California in a person who traveled abroad began on May 21 and was confirmed on May 25.

Under the 1970 California Emergency Services Act, the governor has broad authority to respond during a state of emergency. The governor can “make, amend, and rescind” state regulations and suspend state statutes and has the power to redirect state funds to help in an emergency — even funds appropriated by the California Legislature for an entirely different purpose.

The California Supreme Court in 2021 upheld an appeals court ruling that affirmed Newsom’s emergency powers. Two state Republican lawmakers had challenged Newsom’s power after he declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing he had no right to issue an executive order requiring ballots to be mailed to the state’s 22 million registered voters before the Nov. 3, 2020, election.

The high court ruled the law was constitutional because it required the governor to terminate a declared state of emergency as soon as possible and also allows the Legislature to end it by passing a joint resolution.","Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California on Monday in response to the growing number of monkeypox cases, an action aimed at intensifying the state's vaccination campaign.

""California is actively working at all government levels to mitigate the spread of monkeypox, using our established infrastructure for testing, contact tracing, and community collaboration to make sure we're protecting and informing the most vulnerable populations,"" Newsom stated.

Monkeypox is a disease related to smallpox but is usually less severe. It is currently being transmitted through close contact, often among sexual networks, but authorities stress that the virus can affect anyone through direct contact with infectious sores, scabs or body fluids, or via contaminated materials such as clothing or linens.

With nearly 800 confirmed infections, California's health department is updating its response measures. The emergency proclamation allows for a more streamlined state response, directing agencies to follow the Office of Emergency Services and the California Department of Public Health's lead. Furthermore, emergency medical personnel have been permitted to administer vaccines due to this declaration, helping alleviate the challenge of limited vaccine supplies.

In a recent development, state legislators requested an emergency budget allocation to enhance local efforts in testing, vaccination, and community outreach in the initial stage of the outbreak.

""The current outbreak requires a comprehensive and immediate response to bring it under control,"" commented Sen. Scott Wiener.

The State of California has already distributed a significant number of vaccines with ongoing efforts to secure and distribute more vaccinations, improve risk reduction awareness, and address community concerns.

Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and a distinctive rash that develops over the body, with the illness typically resolving in a few weeks. However, it can lead to more serious complications.

In Los Angeles County, health guidelines have established vaccine eligibility for those at increased risk or who have had recent potential exposures. Additionally, the state has expanded access to antiviral treatments, despite limited drug supplies.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger responded to the state emergency order by pledging to accelerate vaccine and resource distribution for those affected and at risk from the virus, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.

The investigation into California's first monkeypox case associated with international travel began on May 21 and was confirmed by May 25.

The California Emergency Services Act of 1970 grants extensive powers to the governor during states of emergency, including regulation changes, suspending statutes, and reallocating state funds to address the situation at hand.

After facing legal challenges concerning his emergency powers during the COVID-19 emergency declaration, Newsom's authority was ultimately upheld by the California Supreme Court, affirming the governor's capacity to manage statewide emergencies effectively and in accordance with legal protocols.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric in the provided article reveals subtle cues about its underlying political ideology. Here are several instances, along with their explanations:

1. ""Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared a state of emergency in California...""
   - This opening sentence is factual and neutral, setting the stage for reporting on a government action. There is no apparent bias.

2. ""leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic...""
   - The term ""robust"" suggests a viewpoint that sees the government's previous efforts during the pandemic as strong and efficient. This can be seen as supportive of the current administration's actions and policies.

3. ""Though largely spreading among men who have sex with men as well as transgender and nonbinary people, though health officials warn that anyone can contract the virus...""
   - The inclusive language used when mentioning ""transgender and nonbinary people"" reflects sensitivity to diverse identities, which can be characteristic of progressive ideologies that emphasize social inclusivity.

4. ""Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and several other state lawmakers sent a letter to Newsom...""
   - The mention of the Democratic Party affiliation (D-San Francisco) is standard practice in journalism to provide context on a lawmaker's political stance. However, consistently mentioning party affiliations can reinforce the significance of party ideology in the actions of public officials.

5. ""The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it.""
   - This statement affirms the proactive approach being taken by the state government, again implying support for the administration and its emergency response measures.

6. ""The governor’s order said the state is 'distributing its limited supply of the vaccine to local health jurisdictions based on a formula that considers current monkeypox cases and number of high-risk individuals.'""
   - The phrase ""limited supply"" may subtly underscore challenges the state is facing, potentially pointing to issues with federal support or resources without explicitly stating it. This could be interpreted as a critique or push for greater federal involvement, which can align with a political viewpoint advocating for stronger federal support in health crises.

7. ""We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization.""
   - The explicit mention of ""standing with the LGBTQ community"" indicates a stance against discrimination and an alignment with progressive values of equality and inclusivity.

8. ""Two state Republican lawmakers had challenged Newsom’s power after he declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic...""
   - The mention of ""Republican lawmakers"" challenging the governor’s powers during the COVID-19 pandemic provides a context of political opposition, suggesting tension between parties which implies differing ideological stances.

9. ""The high court ruled the law was constitutional because it required the governor to terminate a declared state of emergency as soon as possible...""
   - Closing with information about the high court upholding the governor’s emergency powers frames the current declaration within a context of legal affirmation, suggesting that the government's actions are not only legal but also follow precedent, leaning towards a viewpoint supportive of the current administration.

Overall, the article uses language that tends to support the state government's response, affirms the legality and appropriateness of the governor's actions, and displays sensitivity and inclusivity toward affected communities, particularly the LGBTQ community. It leans towards a viewpoint sympathetic to the current (Democratic) state government and progressive on social issues."
latimes,Climate Change,"If you’ve been yearning for a preview of the battle for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, the place to be last weekend was Las Vegas, where the Republican Jewish Coalition held what some attendees cheekily called a “kosher cattle call” for potential candidates.

Former Vice President Mike Pence was there. So were former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. Former President Trump appeared by video — only a few days before dining with two of the country’s best-known antisemites.

The biggest buzz of the weekend, though, was attached to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the rising 44-year-old star of the conservative firmament, fresh from a landslide reelection.

Around the country, DeSantis noted, many Republicans fell short in this year’s midterm elections. Florida, he said, offered “a blueprint for success.”

DeSantis isn’t running for president yet, at least not officially. He has told supporters to “chill out” until Florida’s legislative session ends in May.

But the presence of so many non-candidates at a Las Vegas cattle call showed that the contest is already underway; that Trump, the only declared candidate, isn’t getting much deference from the party he once led; and that, at least for the moment, DeSantis appears to be the challenger most likely to take the former president down.

Polls don’t mean much at this early stage. At this point ahead of the 2016 GOP race, the top contenders in polls were former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

What the polls can say, however, is that most Republican voters have focused on three names: Trump, DeSantis and Pence. Six months ago, most of them didn’t know who DeSantis was.

“It’s too early to call anyone a front-runner,” said Alex Conant, a strategist for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the 2016 campaign. “But you’d rather be Ron DeSantis than anyone else in the field. He’s made as good a first impression on Republican voters as anyone in decades.”

DeSantis has several things going for him, including the adulation of Fox News, which treats him as a front-runner and has begun casting Trump as yesterday’s man.

DeSantis has used that attention to build a national following as a conservative champion in a multifront culture war on not only traditional GOP issues like abortion and immigration but newer targets like antiracism education in public schools (pilloried by DeSantis and others as “critical race theory”), transgender surgery for minors (DeSantis wants to outlaw it) and a crusade against what he calls “woke banks.”

The governor has proposed legislation to prohibit banks from discriminating against customers for their religious, political or social beliefs. (Conservative activists are convinced that banks run by liberals won’t lend to right-wing organizations.)

His unifying theme is opposition to what he sees as a liberal power elite: not only Democratic politicians but “globalist” big businesses, big tech and “leftist media.”

“We are not afraid to buck the discredited ruling class,” he said in a recent speech. “This is an agenda that is trying to render the conservative half of the country second-class citizens.”

This is Trumpism 2.0: a pugnacious, populist conservatism rooted in resentment but updated, more disciplined and free of the self-absorption of Trump’s version.

“He’s Trump without the craziness,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.

Whether that’s enough to carry DeSantis to the nomination remains to be seen.

“There’s a lot we don’t know yet,” one GOP strategist told me. “He hasn’t really been tested on a national stage. We don’t know how he’ll react to tough opposition. We don’t know how he’ll perform in debates. The Mike Tyson rule applies: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”

And being a front-runner may not be as cushy as it seems. Other candidates are more likely to see you as a target, since you block their way to the top.

“There’s a danger of cannibalism,” Conant said. “In 2016, a lot of other candidates went after Rubio from Day One. Will they start going after DeSantis this time?”

Unlike 2016, in the coming round of Republican primaries no one is likely to underestimate the former president or be surprised by his bulldozer tactics. With their party’s future in their hands, would-be nominees will face a choice.

They can repeat the pattern of 2016, when Trump’s rivals avoided attacking him and savaged one another instead.

Or they can take a page from the Democrats of 2020, who coalesced around Joe Biden once it became clear that their race was headed for a showdown between him and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Biden, who had nearly been counted out of the race a month earlier, is in the White House today. That’s a lesson Republican contenders may want to heed.","Last weekend in Las Vegas, the Republican Jewish Coalition hosted an event that gathered a number of notable figures from the Republican party. Amongst the attendees were former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, and former Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. Former President Trump also made an appearance via video link.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who had recently won re-election by a notable margin, was a significant presence. He pointed out that while various Republican candidates faced setbacks in the year's midterm elections, Florida's approach could serve as a model for success.

Although DeSantis has not officially declared a presidential run and has advised his supporters to wait until after Florida's legislative session concludes in May, this gathering of influential Republicans suggests that the race for the party's nomination is already taking shape.

The current political climate within the Republican Party is such that even Trump, who has already announced his candidacy, does not go unchallenged. DeSantis, at present, seems to be garnering considerable attention as a potential contender for the nomination.

It's acknowledged that it's too soon to rely on polls to predict outcomes. Historical data indicates that early frontrunners do not always secure the nomination. At this stage, Trump, DeSantis, and Pence are among the names gaining the most interest among Republican voters.

DeSantis has been gaining attention for his stances on various issues, including immigration, educational policies, and corporate practices. He has advocated for legislation to prevent discrimination by financial institutions on the basis of personal beliefs, a concern expressed by some conservative activists.

In his recent addresses, DeSantis has criticized what he perceives as overreach by various entities, which he characterizes as being representative of political and corporate interests opposed to conservative values.

DeSantis is described by some as embodying a new wave of the political ideology associated with Trump, but with a distinct approach.

Speculation continues as to whether DeSantis's momentum will translate into a successful bid for the nomination, a question that will be answered as the candidates become subject to the rigorous challenges of a national campaign. This includes responses to opposition, debate performances, and strategy.

As candidates anticipate the primaries, they could proceed with aggressive competition among themselves, or consider strategies that involve consolidating support as seen in other political races, such as the Democratic primaries of 2020. All potential nominees are undoubtedly weighing their next moves carefully, recognizing the impact their choices will have on the future direction of their party.","The article seems to tilt towards a conservative viewpoint, which is sympathetic to Republican perspectives and particularly favorable to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Here are specific instances that display this tendency:

1. ""The biggest buzz of the weekend, though, was attached to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the rising 44-year-old star of the conservative firmament, fresh from a landslide reelection.""
   - By referring to DeSantis as a ""rising [...] star of the conservative firmament"" and emphasizing his ""landslide reelection,"" the wording suggests a positive bias towards DeSantis and frames him as a successful figure within conservative politics.

2. ""DeSantis has used that attention to build a national following as a conservative champion in a multifront culture war...""
   - The phrase ""conservative champion"" creates an image of DeSantis as a heroic figure in the eyes of conservative voters, further indicating a favorable bias towards him and his political ideology. The term ""culture war"" also typically resonates with conservative audiences who perceive themselves as being in a battle with liberal values.

3. ""His unifying theme is opposition to what he sees as a liberal power elite: not only Democratic politicians but 'globalist' big businesses, big tech and 'leftist media.'""
   - The use of terms like ""liberal power elite,"" ""globalist,"" and ""leftist media"" are phrases often used in conservative rhetoric to conjure a sense of opposition towards groups that are typically demonized in right-leaning circles. This aligns with a populist conservative ideology.

4. ""This is Trumpism 2.0: a pugnacious, populist conservatism rooted in resentment but updated, more disciplined and free of the self-absorption of Trump’s version.""
   - The term ""Trumpism 2.0"" suggests an affiliation with the political movement established by Trump, yet improved and more controlled. This could imply that the author views Trump's ideology in a positive light but criticizes his personal flaws, providing a nuanced conservative viewpoint.

5. ""He’s Trump without the craziness,"" said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.
   - By quoting a pollster saying ""He’s Trump without the craziness,"" there is implicit praise for Trump's policies or ideology while distancing from his more controversial behaviors, reinforcing a conservative perspective that acknowledges Trump's success among Republicans but prefers a more stable variant in DeSantis.

6. ""They can take a page from the Democrats of 2020, who coalesced around Joe Biden once it became clear that their race was headed for a showdown between him and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.""
   - By providing this as a strategy for the Republicans, the author implies that the Democrats’ approach to uniting behind a single candidate was a tactically sound one, which could suggest a recognition of effective strategy irrespective of political ideology. The comparison indicates a desire for more pragmatic and strategic unity within the GOP, a sentiment common among more establishment-aligned conservative voices.

In conclusion, the article subtly leans rightwards, not in an overtly partisan way, but through the positive portrayal of Republican figures, especially DeSantis, and the implied criticism of liberal opponents, with underlying tones that resonate well with conservative readers."
latimes,Climate Change,"Last fall, after state and local governments flushed more than $200 million down the toilet for a failed effort to chase Gov. Gavin Newsom from office, there was all sorts of talk about reforming California’s recall process.

Lawmakers held forth, hearings took place, academics weighed in and the state’s independent oversight commission gave the Legislature recommendations.

Then nothing much happened.

“Most of it, I think, is because the average legislator — and we’re the ones who are going to put this on the ballot through a constitutional amendment — isn’t going to be recalled,” said state Sen. Josh Newman, a Fullerton Democrat who was recalled in 2018 before winning back his seat in 2020. “So it doesn’t have the same level of urgency, especially as time goes by.”

Lawmakers also respond to what they’re hearing, or not, from the people they represent. And, let’s face it, voters dealing with soaring inflation, a pandemic, the skyrocketing cost of gas and fears of a recession don’t consider tinkering with California’s recall rules a matter of particular urgency.

But the system needs to be fixed, or soon enough California could face another distracting and expensive attempt to subvert the election process.

How pointless was the attempted recall of Newsom? Essentially, it amounted to a re-running of the 2018 gubernatorial election, which the Democrat won with 61.9% support. The same share, 61.9%, voted against his removal.

The way it now works, a recall election is conducted in two parts. Voters are asked whether a lawmaker should be removed, and if so, who should replace them. That second question allows the top vote-getter to take office even if they fall well short of majority support — which is why outnumbered Republicans found it so enticing to take on the governor.

The presence of that second question allows a political minority to try “to get out of a special election what you obviously couldn’t get out of a normal election,” said Newman, who has introduced legislation to change things so only one question appears on the ballot — a straight up-or-down vote on the recall.

“We [would] still have the option of removing a corrupt or malfeasant elected official,” said Newman, who was ousted after voting to raise gas taxes and vehicle fees. (Though really it was about Republicans denying Democrats their supermajority in the state Senate.) “But we’ve removed the kind of perverse incentive that has led to all this partisan warfare.”

Under his legislation, if a governor were ousted during the first two years of his or her term, the lieutenant governor would take over until a special election to choose a replacement. If the governor had only two years left to serve, the lieutenant governor would finish the term.

The proposal leaves a lot of unsolved problems, but as Newman suggested, change is hard. He once hoped to put his reform measure before voters in November, but legislative inertia makes that extremely unlikely. His goal now is 2024.

The recall is a hand-me-down from the progressive era, one of the tools given citizens to hold their elected leaders accountable. Repeated polls have shown that Californians, by an overwhelming margin, like holding that bludgeon in their hand. (In the last few months, voters in San Francisco booted their district attorney and three members of their school board.)

But the 20th century reform has proven ripe for 21st century abuse, and the failed attempt by out-of-power Republicans to drive Newsom from office — nine months before he was to face voters anyway — highlighted several of its flaws.

Of 19 states that allow their governor to be recalled, California is by far the most permissive, with an exceedingly low signature requirement. And there’s no prerequisite — no requirement for evidence of malfeasance, corruption or criminality — to try to force an incumbent from office.

In the whole history of this country, there have been just four gubernatorial recall elections. Half those occurred in California within the last two decades, which seems like no coincidence given the ease of forcing a vote, the bounty paid to collect signatures and the backdrop of increasingly stark political polarization.

California’s independent oversight agency, the Little Hoover Commission, has recommended several changes. (And here things get a bit wonky, which is another reason that reform efforts appear to have stalled. Process doesn’t inspire great passion, which is one reason you don’t see masses of demonstrators descending on Sacramento chanting, “No bifurcated ballots!”)

One proposal calls for increasing the signature requirement from 12% of the vote in the prior gubernatorial election to 10% of the state’s registered voters, thereby raising the threshold to force a recall. Another would prohibit recalls undertaken during the first 90 days and last six months of an officeholder’s term.

Newman said various remedies are worth discussing, but warned that “there’s a risk of trying to do too much.”

“The more complicated you make it,” he said, “the easier it is for people to obfuscate” the issue and keep anything from getting done.

Still, a revamp of the recall is badly needed, even if it may not be the most pressing issue of the moment. It’s important that our elections have integrity, and that people respect the outcomes and don’t try to overturn them simply because they’re unhappy with the results.

Down that road lies chaos and, at the extreme end, Jan. 6, 2021. The country is still reeling from that horror show.","Last fall, after an unsuccessful recall election involving Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state of California invested a significant amount of public funds. Consequently, discussions about refining the recall process in California started gaining momentum.

State legislators, along with input from academics and California’s independent oversight commission, considered various proposals on how to improve the process.

However, the progress on enacting changes has been slow. State Sen. Josh Newman, who had his own experiences with recall, noted that since most legislators are unlikely to face recall themselves, this issue may not seem urgent. Plus, with residents concerned about a variety of issues like inflation and healthcare, the recall reform might not be at the forefront of their priorities.

In light of these circumstances, Senator Newman has advocated for a shift in how recall elections are structured, proposing a single-question ballot. This change aims to maintain the recall mechanism for its intended purpose – a check on officials when necessary – while removing incentives for partisan misuse.

Additionally, under proposed changes, if a governor were removed early in their term, the lieutenant governor would step in temporarily until a special election. If it occurred later in the term, the lieutenant governor would serve out the remainder.

The challenges of adjusting a long-standing system like this are substantial, and while many ideas have been put forward, striking a balance between different potential reforms is crucial.

The recall mechanism in California stems from the progressive era and is viewed by many residents as an essential tool for accountability. Moreover, recent events have underscored the importance of maintaining this process's integrity. On the national level, the push to preserve democratic practices and assure the validity of elections is evident, indicating the broader implications of local reforms.","The article provided presents an analysis of California's recall process and potential reforms, with a suggestion of subtle political leanings in the use of language and rhetoric. Here are instances that suggest a particular bias or viewpoint:

1. ""Flushed more than $200 million down the toilet for a failed effort to chase Gov. Gavin Newsom from office""
    - This phrase implies a wasteful and pointless endeavor, suggesting that the recall process was misused for political ends rather than serving a valid democratic purpose. The underlying ideology may lean toward a belief in the stability of electoral outcomes and skepticism toward the overuse of recall mechanisms.

2. ""The way it now works, a recall election is conducted in two parts.""
    - The description of the recall process could be read as criticism of its structure, implying that it allows for undemocratic outcomes where a candidate with less than majority support could take office. This language might resonate with an ideology that prioritizes majority rule and fair electoral processes.

3. ""The presence of that second question allows a political minority to try 'to get out of a special election what you obviously couldn’t get out of a normal election.'""
    - Quoting Newman with this statement underscores the argument that the recall process is being exploited by political minorities, which could align with a viewpoint advocating for electoral reform to prevent such exploitation and support majoritarian principles.

4. ""But we’ve removed the kind of perverse incentive that has led to all this partisan warfare.""
    - The term ""perverse incentive"" suggests that the current recall process is not only flawed but also morally questionable, reflecting an ideology that values reducing partisanship and promoting a more principled approach to politics.

5. ""Repeated polls have shown that Californians, by an overwhelming margin, like holding that bludgeon in their hand.""
    - Referring to the recall as a ""bludgeon"" implies a harsh, perhaps overly aggressive use of the recall mechanism, which may be congruent with an ideology that seeks to temper direct democracy with safeguards against manipulation.

6. ""The 20th century reform has proven ripe for 21st century abuse.""
    - This assessment conveys a standpoint that regards the recall process as outdated and susceptible to misuse in the contemporary political climate. It hints at an ideological leaning toward modernization and refinement of democratic tools to prevent abuses.

7. ""Process doesn’t inspire great passion, which is one reason you don’t see masses of demonstrators descending on Sacramento chanting, 'No bifurcated ballots!'""
    - This humorous remark about the lack of public enthusiasm for procedural reforms reveals a perspective that appreciates the complexities of legislative change and the hard work involved in mobilizing support for such issues. It might resonate with a pragmatic or realist political ideology.

8. ""Down that road lies chaos and, at the extreme end, Jan. 6, 2021.""
    - The final sentence draws a parallel between abuse of the recall process and the events of January 6th. This allusion suggests a viewpoint that highly values the sanctity of the electoral process and the risks to democracy when elections are undermined, reflecting an ideology prioritizing constitutional norms and peaceful political transitions."
latimes,Economy,"The recent spike in gasoline prices took the greatest financial toll on Black and Latino Californians, though more than half of all adults in the state reported suffering at least moderate economic hardship, according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California.

Californians living in the Inland Empire and Central Valley, where distant commutes or long drives for work and daily chores are commonplace, also felt a far greater pinch due to steep prices at the pump compared with those living in the state’s densely populated urban landscapes, especially the San Francisco Bay Area.

State Republicans have used high gas prices, which have been on the decline since peaking in the late spring and early summer, to attack Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Legislature’s Democratic leadership for refusing to temporarily suspend the state’s highest-in-the-nation gas tax.

But neither Newsom nor Democratic lawmakers appear to have suffered politically due to the high gas prices or other economic turbulence around the nation, the poll showed.

The survey found that nearly 60% of adults in the state approved of the way Newsom has handled the issue of jobs and the economy, while just under 40% disapproved.

The California Legislature, where Democrats hold supermajorities in both the Senate and Assembly, received similar marks: 55% of adults approved of their actions while 42% disapproved.

Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive, called those approval numbers “incredible” given that the poll also showed that 70% of adults in the state felt that bad times were ahead for the California economy in the next 12 months. Baldassare said the brunt of voter anger over the rise in inflation and other economic concerns has been more focused on President Biden and Congress.

“On inflation, people are not only feeling it but they’re upset,” Baldassare said. “People are feeling that things are just out of control ... and expect government to have a handle on that so that they don’t have to worry about it.”

Perhaps helping Newsom and other Democrat leaders at the Capitol was a spending plan the governor signed in June that will provide payments to 17.5 million California taxpayers to lessen the impact of high fuel prices and the cost of living.

The plan provides payments on a sliding scale based on income. The lowest income bracket is eligible for $350 per tax filer and another $350 for those who claim at least one dependent. Respective payments drop to $250 for the middle-income level and $200 for the highest.

Gas prices have been one of the major drivers of rising inflation nationwide, and the effect has been especially acute in California, which is topped only by Texas when it comes to gasoline consumption.

One in four Latino adults in California said high gas prices caused severe financial hardship, and 49% reported moderate hardship, the poll found. Among Black adults, 23% reported severe financial hardship and 35% moderate. Severe hardship also was felt among 15% of white and 12% of Asian American adults. Moderate hardship was reported by 36% of white and 20% of Asian American adults, according to the poll.

Despite calls by mostly Republican leaders to combat high gasoline prices by expanding oil production, two-thirds of Californians remain opposed to more offshore oil drilling, the poll found.","Recent increases in gasoline prices have impacted many Californians with varying degrees of financial strain, according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California.

Residents in the Inland Empire and Central Valley, areas known for longer commutes, are especially feeling the effects of higher fuel costs. This impact appears to be less acute in more urban areas like the San Francisco Bay Area, where shorter commutes are more typical.

The issue of gas prices and the state gas tax has been a topic of discussion among state Republican leaders in relation to the current administration led by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Despite the debate around gas prices and other economic factors, current polling data shows a significant level of approval for Newsom’s handling of employment and the economy.

Furthermore, the California Legislature, with a strong representation of Democrats, has received favorable approval ratings in relation to its performance.

Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive, noted the contrasting views of Californians, who express concern for the state's economic outlook while largely approving of the current leadership's performance on economic matters. Observations suggest that broader national economic issues may be influencing the public's sentiment.

Recent measures signed by the governor, aimed at providing financial relief to taxpayers, address the effects of rising fuel prices. The tiered payment plan prioritizes different levels of income, with varying payment amounts designed to aid individuals and families.

California, ranking high in terms of gasoline consumption, has been significantly impacted by the upward trend in fuel prices. The rise in fuel costs has caused financial difficulties across different demographics, with a notable incidence of hardship reported by Latino and Black adults, as well as varying degrees by white and Asian American adults.

While there have been suggestions from some leaders to boost oil production as a strategy to address fuel costs, a majority of Californians have expressed opposition to an increase in offshore oil drilling. This response indicates a preference for alternative solutions to the issue of gasoline pricing.","This analysis will examine language and rhetoric used in the article that might indicate an underlying political ideology. For each instance, I will highlight quotes or descriptions from the text and provide an explanation of the context or meaning.

1. ""high gas prices"" – The description of gas prices as ""high"" is a subjective assessment that implies the author perceives the prices to be unusually or problematically elevated. This could indicate concern for the economic well-being of consumers, a view often associated with progressive ideologies.

2. ""took the greatest financial toll on Black and Latino Californians"" – The focus on the impact on specific racial groups suggests a sensitivity to issues of equity and social justice, which are hallmarks of left-leaning ideologies.

3. ""State Republicans have used high gas prices [...] to attack Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Legislature’s Democratic leadership"" – The use of ""attack"" to describe Republican actions indicates a portrayal of conflict and opposition, which could suggest the author views the criticism as aggressive or overly confrontational. This choice of words may subtly align with a defense of the current leadership, implying a bias toward the Democratic party.

4. ""neither Newsom nor Democratic lawmakers appear to have suffered politically"" – This statement implies resilience or approval of Democratic politicians despite challenges, which could be indicative of the author’s approval of these figures or their governance.

5. ""Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive, called those approval numbers 'incredible'"" – The use of ""incredible"" to describe approval ratings suggests a positive surprise at the resilience of Democratic politicians' popularity. This presents the information in a light that may imply approval of their performance, indicating a left-leaning stance.

6. ""spending plan the governor signed in June that will provide payments to 17.5 million California taxpayers"" – The positive framing of a relief measure initiated by a Democratic governor could reflect an ideological bias in favor of government interventions aimed at economic assistance, aligning with progressive policies.

7. ""to lessen the impact of high fuel prices and the cost of living"" – By explaining the goal of the spending plan, the author underscores the government's response to economic issues, which might imply an endorsement of proactive governance, as valued by left-leaning ideologies.

8. ""Despite calls by mostly Republican leaders to combat high gasoline prices by expanding oil production, two-thirds of Californians remain opposed to more offshore oil drilling"" – By stating that the majority of Californians are opposed to a typically Republican solution to high gas prices, the author might be emphasizing public resistance to conservative policies on energy and framing the Democratic position as being more in line with public opinion.

It should be stressed that while certain phrases and framing could suggest an underlying political ideology, such interpretations are subjective and the language used in the article could also be seen as striving for balance by presenting both sides of a political debate. Without further context on the author's intent and overall body of work, the ideological leanings deduced from a single article should be understood as tentative."
latimes,Economy,"The Biden administration plans to exclude Cuba from the upcoming Summit of the Americas, a major global meeting to be held in Los Angeles in June that typically welcomes all governments in the Western Hemisphere, a senior U.S. official told The Times.

The summit, which is held every three or four years, is being convened in the United States for the first time since its 1994 inaugural session in Miami. Los Angeles was chosen as the venue earlier this year.

The administration’s refusal to invite Cuba is likely to anger several other Latin American countries as President Biden and the State Department attempt to repair damaged relations in the region.

“We expect the democratic nations of our hemisphere to gather for a conversation,” Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, said in an interview, referring to the summit.

Cuba, he said, is decidedly not part of that group, especially after demonstrations in July in which Cubans demanded political and economic freedoms. Many people were arrested and at least one died. In addition, Washington has opposed Russian influence in communist-ruled Cuba, its lack of free speech and its human rights record.

Numerous advocates who support improved relations with Cuba — including some in Congress — had hoped the Biden administration would reopen diplomatic, political and trade ties with the island that were frozen under President Trump. Trump reversed a historic opening initiated by President Obama, who sought to end a half-century of Cold War hostilities.

However, President Biden has done little to roll back Trump’s rebukes of Cuba, which included adding the country to a U.S. government list of state sponsors of terrorism. And the administration is only slowly reestablishing U.S. consular services in Havana that would help Cubans obtain visas for legal travel.

In addition, a U.S. policy on remittances, money that people, including Cuban Americans, can send to island residents, remains “under review,” strangling a lifeline for many. Flights by American carriers, trips by U.S. tourists and cultural exchanges also remain problematic without clearer guidelines from the administration.

Meanwhile, a tough economic embargo on the island that dates to the Eisenhower administration remains in place.

The hard line on Cuba appears to have carried over to the Summit of the Americas.

For many summits after the inaugural session, all held in Latin America or the Caribbean, Cuba has not been invited or has declined an invitation.

More recently, however, its government began to participate, invited despite it engaging in practices that other members of the region’s diplomatic bodies, such as the Organization of American States, have harshly condemned.

The U.S. decision, which has not been formally announced and will ultimately be made by Biden, is already attracting criticism in the region.

In addition to Cuba voicing opposition to the move, officials in Mexico, a key U.S. ally, indicated they were not pleased. In a phone call on April 29, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged Biden to invite to the summit all the countries of the Western Hemisphere, “without excluding anyone.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard held closed-door meetings with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Tuesday in Washington. Ebrard said later at a news conference at the Mexican Embassy that he asked Blinken to reconsider denying invitations to Cuba, as well as to Nicaragua and Venezuela, which are also expected to be excluded. Ebrard said he came away without a definitive answer.

On April 11, 2015, on the sidelines of a Summit of the Americas in Panama, Obama met and shook hands with then-President Raul Castro of Cuba, the first contact between leaders of the two countries in decades. Obama said at the time that he believed the two countries could disagree in “the spirit of respect and civility” and that the time was coming “to turn the page.”

Within months, the two revived diplomatic ties between their countries, reopened various economic and trade arrangements, and Obama made a historic trip to Havana.

Trump reversed those actions, ending travel and freezing remittances and reversing diplomatic overtures. And Biden has not chosen to reinstate Obama’s diplomatic approach.

For the Summit of the Americas, it is also unlikely that the U.S. will invite Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega has conducted what the U.S. and many other nations and democracy groups call a sham election that gave him yet another term in office.

And Venezuela is always the skunk at the picnic, with President Nicolas Maduro shunned at most international gatherings. The question is whether Biden will invite Juan Guaidó, a Venezuelan opposition leader whom the U.S. government has recognized as the rightful leader of the country despite little domestic support.

Yet some questionable democracies will be invited because of overriding ties they have with the United States, Nichols and other officials said.

El Salvador, for example, has such long-standing ties with the U.S., dating to its civil war in the 1980s — in which the Reagan administration backed the Salvadoran government and numerous U.S. church and civil rights groups supported the opposition — that the country should not be excluded, Nichols said.

“We obviously have deep and long-standing ties with El Salvador and their millions of Salvadorans in the United States,” Nichols said, noting that ties were particularly strong to Southern California.

“We have very substantial differences with President [Nayib] Bukele on a number of issues, particularly related to democracy, the separation of powers and transparency, [yet] I believe that it will be important for El Salvador to participate,” Nichols said, referring to recent actions by Bukele to erode judicial independence and silence dissent and journalists critical of his administration.

The summit will be a forum to discuss immigration, trade, climate change and ways to reinforce democracy, among other topics. Nichols said it was likely the region’s leaders will produce a “Los Angeles declaration” on promoting “safe, humane orderly migration” and ensuring that migrants “can be protected where they are, and there are opportunities for them to remain in place.”","The Biden administration is currently considering not inviting Cuba to the upcoming Summit of the Americas, as stated by a senior U.S. official. The meeting, scheduled to take place in Los Angeles in June, generally brings together all governments from the Western Hemisphere and marks the first instance it's hosted in the United States since 1994.

According to Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, the summit aims to assemble nations from the hemisphere for dialogue. Cuba, however, following the public demonstrations for political and economic changes in July, in which there were several arrests and at least one fatality, may not be part of this group. The U.S. also has concerns over Cuba's alignment with Russia, its restrictions on freedom of expression, and its overall human rights situation.

There had been expectations that the Biden administration might move to rekindle the warmer ties with Cuba initiated under President Obama, which saw an easing of a decades-long standoff. Despite this, the current administration has maintained many of the previous administration’s policies, including Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism, and moves to reopen consular services in Havana have progressed slowly.

Policies regarding remittances to Cuba are being reviewed, and the continuation of an economic embargo dating back to the Eisenhower administration remains in effect.

The potential non-invitation of Cuba to the summit could be seen as a continuation of a firm stance from previous summits, where Cuba either did not participate or was not invited, with additional speculation that Nicaragua and Venezuela may also not be included.

Concerns from other nations in the region have surfaced, with Mexico expressing a wish that all countries of the Western Hemisphere be invited without exclusions.

The Summit of the Americas serves as a platform to address a wide range of issues including immigration, trade, climate change, and the promotion of democratic practices. It is hoped that through this summit, a plan of action for these areas might be developed, including efforts related to migration and safeguarding opportunities for individuals within their home countries.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric in the provided article, we can identify various instances indicating the underlying political ideology:

1. ""The Biden administration plans to exclude Cuba from the upcoming Summit of the Americas...""
   - The use of ""plans to exclude"" implies a deliberate action by the current U.S. administration, which reflects an ideological stance taken against certain governments based on their political systems or human rights records.

2. ""The administration’s refusal to invite Cuba...""
   - The word ""refusal"" denotes a position of authority and decision-making power, reinforcing the ideological perspective that the U.S. has the right to set the terms of participation based on its democratic values.

3. ""We expect the democratic nations of our hemisphere to gather for a conversation.""
   - By emphasizing ""democratic nations,"" there is a clear ideological message that the event prioritizes countries with democratic systems, which can be an implicit critique of non-democratic regimes.

4. ""...especially after demonstrations in July in which Cubans demanded political and economic freedoms.""
   - Highlighting the demonstrations for freedoms underscores a democratic ideology that values political and economic freedoms, setting these as standards for inclusion.

5. ""However, President Biden has done little to roll back Trump’s rebukes of Cuba...""
   - The phrase ""done little to roll back"" suggests a critique of the current administration's approach, indicating an expectation—possibly from a more engagement-oriented ideology—that the administration should reverse previous hardline policies.

6. ""...adding the country to a U.S. government list of state sponsors of terrorism.""
   - Citing the designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism infers a specific ideological stance that categorizes governments based on perceived threats to national security and international norms.

7. ""...remains under review, strangling a lifeline for many.""
   - The use of ""strangling"" is emotive language signifying that the policy is harmful to the people of Cuba, suggesting a humanitarian or empathetic viewpoint.

8. ""The hard line on Cuba appears to have carried over to the Summit of the Americas.""
   - The term ""hard line"" indicates firm and possibly inflexible policies that stem from an ideological position concerning governance, human rights, or international relations.

9. ""...invited despite it engaging in practices that other members of the region’s diplomatic bodies... have harshly condemned.""
   - The phrasing ""harshly condemned"" implies a standard of behavior expected by the international community and highlights a divergence from this standard by Cuba.

10. ""For many summits after the inaugural session, all held in Latin America or the Caribbean, Cuba has not been invited or has declined an invitation.""
    - The stark contrast between being ""not invited"" or having ""declined an invitation"" implicitly suggests ideological rifts and geopolitical tensions that influence diplomatic interactions.

11. ""And Venezuela is always the skunk at the picnic, with President Nicolas Maduro shunned at most international gatherings.""
    - The metaphor ""skunk at the picnic"" vividly conveys the perception of Venezuela as an unwelcome and disruptive presence, reinforcing an ideological bias against its government.

12. ""Yet some questionable democracies will be invited because of overriding ties they have with the United States...""
    - The phrase ""questionable democracies"" suggests a critical view of certain political systems while acknowledging pragmatic or strategic alliances, hinting at a realpolitik approach that may override strict ideological consistency.

In summary, the language and rhetoric in the article suggest a political ideology that values democratic principles, human rights, and the rule of law while also considering strategic interests and existing relationships. There is an inherent bias toward inclusion based on shared democratic values and a willingness to challenge or exclude governments that deviate from those standards, as seen in the case of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela."
latimes,Election,"Alexandra Pelosi was having one of those days.

She’s still raw from the hammer attack on her father by a QAnon crazy. “I have not slept through the night since,” Pelosi confessed.

A recent morning found her whipping up a Betty Crocker birthday cake, readying her New York apartment for an invasion of teenage girls and vacuuming the broken glass from a toppled Christmas tree, all while fending off a sister demanding to know why that was included in the new documentary she produced on their famous mother.

The trailer had just come out.

“I’m doing PR management in my own family,” a harried Pelosi said, as a cheery “Happy Birthday” banner — hung in honor of her 15-year-old — did its best to brighten things.

Pelosi, the youngest of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s five children, is a filmmaker who launched her career with the cheeky documentary “Journeys with George,” a verite look at the 2000 presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. She spent months living on the campaign charter, as a camcorder-toting producer for NBC News. Pelosi has since created more than a dozen documentaries, on such topics as child poverty, big money in politics and the effects of the tech boom on San Francisco, where she was born and raised.

With a camera as her constant companion — and occasional irritant to those around her — Pelosi filmed thousands of hours of her mother, in public settings and private moments, doing housework and the work of House speaker. The finished product begins airing Tuesday on HBO.

“This is my view and it’s my movie,” Pelosi said, noting some in her family might have preferred a more worshipful look at their path-breaking parent. She said the speaker — whom she repeatedly referred to, with professional distance, as “Nancy Pelosi” — wasn’t a particularly cooperative subject.

“If I tried to ask her a question, she never plays ball with me,” Pelosi said. “She never gave me permission to film. She always said, ‘Why are you filming all this?’ She never understood. So it wasn’t authorized, she never signed a release... She saw the trailer, she told me, ‘You should take out this, this and this.’

“I go, ‘Mom, the trailer’s on YouTube,’” Pelosi said in the tone of exasperated offspring the world over.

Not, she noted, that the speaker had any say in the matter.

At 52, Pelosi has her mother’s hummingbird energy, traces of the speaker’s husky voice and a speeding-subway-train delivery that’s more New York than California. She spoke via Zoom, wearing a purple turtleneck — her trademark color — with the tumbled Christmas tree and scattered presents just off-camera.

Pelosi described her latest project as a happy accident growing out of a 2018 conversation in the HBO cafeteria with Geof Bartz, a frequent collaborator and the network’s supervising editor for documentaries. She mentioned her extensive catalog of family footage, and Bartz agreed to take a look and see if there was something there.

That November, Democrats took control of the House, and Pelosi was installed for a second history-making go-round as speaker. The documentary’s perspective shifted from a look back on Pelosi’s career to a more contemporaneous account of her battles with then-President Trump, culminating in the Jan. 6 raid on Congress by insurrectionists seeking to overturn the 2020 election.

In October, the House committee investigating the failed coup released snippets of iPhone footage Alexandra Pelosi shot that day, showing lawmakers fleeing for their lives and desperately seeking assistance to quell the riot. At one point, a furious Nancy Pelosi said she wanted to punch Trump, who incited the violence and blithely watched his marauding supporters on TV.

The tinfoil-hat crowd has seized on Alexandra Pelosi’s presence as somehow proving the whole thing — the desecration of the Capitol, the assault on democracy — was staged. No surprise there. She’s prepared, Pelosi said, for that kind of crazy, as well as efforts to embarrass her mother by turning her work into a mockumentary spoofing the life and unflattering times of the speaker.

“I know that Tucker Carlson will pick out, like, the most silly moments and exploit it for his own political purposes,” Pelosi said of the Fox News hatemonger. “And then all of his followers will go online and destroy my film to ensure it doesn’t get taken seriously as a documentary. And that’s fine. I’m a big girl, I’m wearing my big-girl pants, I couldn’t care less.

“What I do care about,” and here she paused for several seconds, “is that I don’t want them to break into my house and attack me in the middle of the night.”

It was no idle thought.

Pelosi, who has been targeted with a steady stream of death threats, lives now with security outside her apartment. Her teenagers have received death threats as well. She described walking down the street with them and being accosted by strangers demanding answers to some of the ludicrous, conspiratorial questions Carlson and his fellow trolls have raised about the attack on her father.

“There’s this very toxic, negative energy circulating around my family,” Pelosi said matter-of-factly, “and we live with it.”

The release of “Pelosi in the House” could have been a triumphant moment, marrying Alexandra Pelosi’s artistic eye with a lifetime’s worth of unparalleled access to one of the most powerful and important women in U.S. history. The documentary — with its chilling images of Jan. 6, its intimate sausage-making look at the legislative process, its charming mother-daughter banter — is genuinely revealing.

But Pelosi isn’t looking for rave reviews, or to send TV ratings through the roof.

“All I care about,” she said, “is that I physically survive the release of this film.”","Alexandra Pelosi's day was far from ordinary.

The recent violent attack on her father deeply affected her, contributing to sleepless nights. Despite the turmoil, Pelosi's morning was consumed with domestic tasks in her New York apartment, including baking a birthday cake, preparing for her daughter's celebration, and cleaning up after an accidental Christmas tree mishap.

Pelosi, the youngest of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s five children, has carved out a career as a documentary filmmaker. Her first project, ""Journeys with George,"" provided an observational look at George W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign, where she worked as a producer for NBC News. She has since produced a series of documentaries covering topics ranging from social issues to political landscapes.

With her latest HBO documentary offering an intimate glimpse into the life of her mother, Pelosi faced the challenges of capturing candid moments within her own famous family. She depicted her approach to the film as independent, with her family sometimes wishing for a different portrayal of their matriarch. Pelosi recounted her mother's reluctance to be filmed and her own resolve in creating the film she envisioned.

Pelosi shared her thoughts via Zoom, dressed distinctively and seated beside off-camera signs of a recent domestic mishap. She spoke about the documentary's unexpected direction, how it evolved from archival footage to real-time narratives encompassing significant political events, including the January 6th events in the Capitol.

Footage from Pelosi's iPhone revealed during the House committee investigation shed light on the lawmakers' experiences during the capitol breach. This material has attracted attention and controversy, leading to critical responses in the media and online.

Now 52, Pelosi expressed concerns about her family's safety in the face of ongoing threats. She highlighted the realities of public engagement and the impact of divisive rhetoric on their private lives. Despite these challenges, Pelosi remains focused on her work and its significance, rather than seeking public acclaim or record viewership numbers.

Her latest documentary was a unique opportunity to merge her filmmaking talent with access to a prominent political figure, resulting in a film that offers an unvarnished look at historical events and personal dynamics. For Pelosi, the success of the project is secondary to her personal security as she anticipates the film's public response.","The article contains language that suggests certain political ideologies and biases. Here are several examples:

1. Brief quote: “She’s still raw from the hammer attack on her father by a QAnon crazy.”
   Ideological indication: Describing the assailant as a ""QAnon crazy"" implies a disregard for the QAnon conspiracy theory and those who believe in it, which is a perspective more associated with left-leaning ideologies that highly criticize the QAnon movement.

2. Brief quote: “Pelosi, the youngest of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s five children, is a filmmaker who launched her career with the cheeky documentary...”
   Ideological indication: The use of the word ""cheeky"" to describe Pelosi's work imparts a casual and potentially approving tone, suggesting a favorable view of Pelosi's approach to her subjects, which can hint at a more liberal bias.

3. Brief quote: “The finished product begins airing Tuesday on HBO.”
   Ideological indication: The mention of HBO, a network known for its progressive programming, without any negative connotation, may subtly align the article with a more left-leaning perspective.

4. Brief quote: “...a more contemporaneous account of her battles with then-President Trump, culminating in the Jan. 6 raid on Congress by insurrectionists seeking to overturn the 2020 election.”
   Ideological indication: Referring to the January 6th event as a ""raid on Congress by insurrectionists"" strongly suggests a stance against the actions of the rioters and aligns with the narrative commonly held by more liberal sources that view the incident as an attack on democracy.

5. Brief quote: “...who incited the violence and blithely watched his marauding supporters on TV.”
   Ideological indication: The use of words like ""incited,"" ""violence,"" ""blithely,"" and ""marauding"" in the context of describing Trump's actions and supporters conveys a strong condemnation of Trump's behavior, indicative of a political stance highly critical of the former president, aligning with a liberal point of view.

6. Brief quote: “...the Fox News hatemonger.”
   Ideological indication: Labeling Tucker Carlson as a ""Fox News hatemonger"" expresses a direct negative bias against the Fox News personality and, by extension, the conservative news network where he is a prominent figure.

7. Brief quote: “She’s prepared, Pelosi said, for that kind of crazy, as well as efforts...”
   Ideological indication: The phrase ""that kind of crazy"" minimizes and ridicules the credibility of right-wing conspiracies and the actions of conservative media figures, reflecting a dismissive attitude consistent with left-leaning ideology.

8. Brief quote: “...marrying Alexandra Pelosi’s artistic eye with a lifetime’s worth of unparalleled access to one of the most powerful and important women in U.S. history.”
   Ideological indication: The description of Nancy Pelosi as ""one of the most powerful and important women in U.S. history"" is an accolade that suggests a positive and admiring perspective towards the Democratic Speaker, indicative of a liberal viewpoint supportive of Pelosi's role and impact. 

Overall, the article's language and rhetoric lend to the interpretation that it comes from a left-leaning perspective, showing admiration for Pelosi and her family while casting a critical eye towards right-wing media and ideologies."
latimes,Election,"A federal judge on Wednesday handed an incremental victory to the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection in a case involving California attorney John Eastman.

Eastman, who advised former President Trump on efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, has been fighting to prevent the committee from seeing more than 100 emails involving him.

The judge ruled against Eastman for now, saying the court would review the documents to determine which can be turned over to the panel.

Eastman has emerged as a central figure in the committee’s investigation into Trump’s efforts to subvert the election results.

He wrote two legal memos arguing that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to unilaterally reject electoral votes or delay their counting, which could have opened the door for Republican-led state legislatures to cast their votes for Trump even though more voters cast their ballots for Joe Biden. The advice was disregarded by Pence and roundly denounced by legal experts when it became public last year.

The congressional committee subpoenaed emails sent or received by Eastman from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, 2021.

Eastman sued to block release of the documents, which are housed on the server of Chapman University in Orange, which was Eastman’s employer at the time. He argued that they’re protected from disclosure by attorney-client privilege and related legal rules.

“After reading the emails, the Court will determine for each document whether any privilege existed, whether that privilege was waived, and whether any exceptions apply,” wrote U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who is based in Santa Ana.

“Ultimately, the Court will issue a written decision including its full analysis and its final determination of which, if any, documents must be disclosed to the Select Committee.”

The committee had argued for the court review of 111 disputed emails in a hearing on Tuesday, which also offered more insight into the panel’s theory of potential criminal charges against Trump, which was first revealed last week in a court filing pertaining to Eastman’s lawsuit.

In that filing, the committee alleged that the emails it was seeking from Eastman could show that Trump broke multiple laws by seeking to block the certification of Biden’s win despite knowing that his claims of fraud were unfounded.

The committee said attorney-client privilege between Eastman and Trump would not apply to evidence demonstrating crime or fraud.

Charles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman, acknowledged in the hearing it was likely the judge would review the documents and tamped down expectations the emails would reveal blatant wrongdoing.

“There’s not going to be an email where anyone involved in the campaign effort says, ‘We’ve got to have some ruffians rush the Capitol if the vice president doesn’t make the decision we want.’ It’s not going to be there,” Burnham said.

“There’s not going to be an email that says, ‘We all know the election had no fraud or illegality, but we’ve got to come up with something.’”

Douglas Letter, counsel for the House select committee, said while they didn’t expect the emails would show such flagrant violations, there was already information that points to fraud or criminal intent.

He cited an email to Pence’s counsel, Greg Jacob, in which Eastman said Trump had been advised there was nothing supporting his allegations of electoral fraud, but “once [Trump] gets something in his head, it’s hard to get him to change course.”

“That’s pretty strong evidence ... that Trump was ignoring all of the very clear evidence because he wanted something different,” Letter said. “He wanted the vice president to do something that was plainly against the Constitution.

Carter, in his order, did not address the committee’s allegations of criminal or fraudulent activity. He said the panel raised sufficient questions about whether Eastman’s emails would be shielded under attorney-client privilege or as work product made in anticipation of a lawsuit.

While the ruling advances the committee’s efforts, Carter noted that “reading the emails does not mean that the Court will ultimately require disclosure.” The order did not specify when it will determine which emails should be turned over to congressional investigators.

The hearing also involved an attorney for Chapman University, where Eastman served as law professor and onetime dean of the law school.

An uproar over Eastman’s involvement with Trump, including his appearance at a pro-Trump rally immediately preceding the insurrection at the Capitol, prompted the professor to retire abruptly one week after Jan. 6.","A federal judge on Wednesday issued a ruling important to the congressional committee investigating the events of Jan. 6, in a case involving California attorney John Eastman.

Eastman, who provided legal advice to former President Trump on the 2020 presidential election, has been attempting to prevent the committee from accessing over 100 emails.

The judge decided the court would review the documents to assess which ones should be provided to the panel.

Eastman is a significant subject in the committee's examination of the actions surrounding the election.

He authored two memos suggesting Vice President Mike Pence might reject or delay electoral votes, a move that was not acted upon by Pence and received widespread criticism from legal experts upon becoming public.

The congressional committee is seeking emails sent or received by Eastman from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, 2021.

Eastman filed a lawsuit to stop the release of these documents, stored on the server of his then-employer Chapman University in Orange, claiming they are protected by attorney-client privilege and other legal doctrines.

U.S. District Judge David O. Carter will review the emails to ascertain the legitimacy of any claimed privileges.

The committee had argued for the review of 111 emails in a recent hearing, which also delved into their perspective on potential legal violations by Trump, as highlighted in a previous court filing related to Eastman's lawsuit.

In that filing, the committee sought to demonstrate that the emails from Eastman might prove that Trump sought to hinder the certification of the election outcome.

Charles Burnham, Eastman's attorney, expressed in the hearing that the documents, once reviewed, are unlikely to show explicit misconduct.

Douglas Letter, counsel for the congressional committee, pointed to certain pieces of evidence that may suggest improper intent without expecting the emails to show direct violations.

Judge Carter, in his order, did not comment on any allegations of criminal activity. He indicated that the committee has raised questions regarding the applicability of attorney-client privilege to Eastman's emails.

Carter's ruling progresses the committee's investigative work but stressed that the act of reviewing the emails does not guarantee they will be disclosed.

The hearing also involved representation for Chapman University, where Eastman was a law professor and former dean. Eastman retired from his position following significant attention on his activities related to the presidential transition.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric in this article does show a number of phrases and descriptions that indicate an angle or interpretation consistent with a specific political view. However, it's important to clarify that the identification of ideologically-charged language does not necessarily mean that the article is explicitly biased or inaccurate; rather, it indicates that certain choices in words or the presentation of information can suggest a lean towards a particular political stance. Here are a few examples:

1. **Incremental victory to the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection**: The use of the term ""insurrection"" to describe the events of January 6 is more commonly used among those who view the incident as a serious breach of democratic norms aimed at overthrowing the election. The word ""insurrection"" carries strong connotations and suggests an unlawful attempt to disrupt the constitutional process.

2. **Efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election**: This phrase implies that the election results were legitimate and that any attempts to challenge them were baseless, aligning with an ideology that respects the election's outcome and frames the challenges as undemocratic.

3. **A central figure in the committee’s investigation into Trump’s efforts to subvert the election results**: The word ""subvert"" suggests an undermining of the democratic process, indicating a viewpoint critical of the attempts to change the election's outcome.

4. **The advice was disregarded by Pence and roundly denounced by legal experts**: This statement implies a consensus among reputable legal authorities that the advice was unsound or inappropriate, suggesting a viewpoint that aligns with mainstream legal opinion and regards the advice as fringe or illegitimate.

5. **Alleged that the emails it was seeking from Eastman could show that Trump broke multiple laws**: The use of the word ""alleged"" is standard in journalism to report claims that have yet to be proven. However, in this context, it suggests the potential for finding evidence of illegality, thereby aligning with a view that is suspicious of the past administration's actions post-election.

6. **Despite knowing that his claims of fraud were unfounded**: The language here presupposes that the claims of fraud were indeed unfounded, which reflects the predominant legal and informational consensus, but could also indicate a viewpoint that is critical of those who challenged the election's integrity.

7. **He wanted the vice president to do something that was plainly against the Constitution**: This statement articulates a clear judgment about what was constitutional or not, implicitly siding with the interpretation that certain actions were definitively unconstitutional.

8. **An uproar over Eastman’s involvement with Trump, including his appearance at a pro-Trump rally immediately preceding the insurrection at the Capitol, prompted the professor to retire abruptly**: The description here may suggest a causal relationship between the ""uproar"" and Eastman's retirement, implying a negative public reaction to what is categorized as involvement in insurrection-related activities.

These examples encapsulate language that aligns with a particular viewpoint that is critical of attempts to overturn or question the 2020 election results. Each selection of phrases implicitly or explicitly frames the events in a light that is commonly associated with democratic and institutionalist ideologies that emphasize the sanctity of electoral processes and legal norms."
latimes,Immigration,"Acting on an emergency appeal from some Republican-led states, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a temporary order Monday that will preserve — for now — a Trump-era policy that turned away most migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.

The chief justice asked for a response from the Biden administration by the end of the day Tuesday.

It remains unclear whether Roberts or the full Supreme Court will make a decision on the appeal before Wednesday, when the so-called Title 42 rule is set to end.

Tens of thousands of migrants have been moving toward the border with Mexico, believing the rule would expire this week.

The Trump administration adopted the rule in response to the COVID-19 emergency and authorized the government to turn away migrants without giving them an asylum hearing. Title 42 refers to part of a U.S. public health law that allows the government to act during certain emergencies.

The Biden administration had said that as the pandemic eased, the restrictions may no longer be needed.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington set aside the rule, holding that it was no longer justified as a pandemic measure. His decision allowed for an appeal, but it was due to take effect Wednesday.

Arizona Atty. Gen. Mark Brnovich joined with 18 other states and filed an emergency appeal asking Roberts and the Supreme Court to intervene. He said the border states will see a surge of new migrants, and he argued the high court should hear the case first.

“No one reasonably disputes that the failure to grant a stay will cause a crisis of unprecedented proportions at the border,” he wrote. The Department of Homeland Security “estimates that daily illegal crossings may more than double from around 7,000/day to 15,000/day once Title 42 is terminated.”

He also argued that the Biden administration failed to vigorously defend the policy in court.

The White House had no immediate comment Monday.

Roberts said the restrictions would remain in place until the court acts.

In recent months, the Supreme Court has issued similar temporary administrative orders to give the justices a few days to hear from both sides in a case and decide what to do. In several occasions, the court has ultimately turned down an emergency appeal even after the justices put the matter on hold temporarily.","On an appeal from a group of states, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has temporarily maintained a policy from a previous administration which has been influential in the handling of asylum requests at the southern border of the United States.

The chief justice has requested a response from the current administration by the conclusion of Tuesday.

The future of the policy, known formally as Title 42 and originally set to cease on Wednesday, remains uncertain as either Roberts or the full Supreme Court is yet to decide on the appeal.

There has been a significant increase in the number of migrants heading towards the Mexican border, in anticipation that the policy might end soon.

This policy was put into place during the COVID-19 health crisis, enabling federal authorities to deny migrants an opportunity for an asylum hearing. Title 42 is derived from a segment of U.S. legislation related to public health, allowing for government action in emergency situations.

The current administration has indicated that the policy may no longer be necessary as the health crisis abates.

A month ago, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington nullified the rule, stating it was no longer warranted as a health measure. This permitted an appeal, but the effectuation was planned for Wednesday.

Representing a consortium of states, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed an appeal, requesting the intervention of the Supreme Court. He mentioned potential increases in migrant arrivals at the border and suggested the case be considered by the high court without delay.

He highlighted that ending the policy could lead to considerable challenges at the border, citing estimated figures from the Department of Homeland Security that projected a significant rise in crossings.

Additionally, there were suggestions that the policy had not been adequately defended in court by the current administration.

As of Monday, there was no immediate statement from the White House on the matter.

Roberts stated that the policy would remain in effect pending further action by the court.

In the past, the Supreme Court has temporarily sustained policies while it takes time to review arguments from involved parties and reach a decision. On occasions, the court has decided not to proceed with an emergency appeal after temporarily suspending the associated policy.","The analysis of the article's language and rhetoric to determine the underlying political ideology involves looking at word choices, phrases, and framing that suggest a bias or viewpoint. Here are some examples from the article provided:

(1) ""Acting on an emergency appeal from some Republican-led states...""
- This phrase sets the context, specifying that the action is taken on behalf of states led by the Republican party, which can suggest a conservative, possibly anti-immigration stance.

(2) ""...a Trump-era policy that turned away most migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.""
- The term ""Trump-era policy"" evokes the policies of the former president, Donald Trump, known for his strict immigration policies. Referring to his administration can signal a reminder of divisive political positions on immigration.

(3) ""The Trump administration adopted the rule in response to the COVID-19 emergency...""
- Describing the policy as adopted ""in response to the COVID-19 emergency"" can give the impression that it was a temporary and necessary measure due to the pandemic, potentially downplaying any political motivation.

(4) ""Tens of thousands of migrants have been moving toward the border with Mexico, believing the rule would expire this week.""
- The phrase ""moving toward the border"" might evoke images of a large-scale movement that could be interpreted as overwhelming or concerning, which can play into a narrative of threat or crisis often used in conservative rhetoric on immigration.

(5) “No one reasonably disputes that the failure to grant a stay will cause a crisis of unprecedented proportions at the border,” he wrote.
- The use of ""crisis of unprecedented proportions"" is a highly emotive phrase that suggests that ending the policy would create chaos, a viewpoint typically associated with a political ideology that favors strict border control.

(6) ""The Department of Homeland Security 'estimates that daily illegal crossings may more than double from around 7,000/day to 15,000/day once Title 42 is terminated.'""
- The focus on ""illegal crossings"" and the quantification of potential increases may instill fear and convey a security threat, aligning with conservative views that prioritize border security.

The specific balance of rhetoric in this article reflects the procedural aspects of the legal decisions regarding the policy without a strong lean towards a specific ideology. However, the language does highlight the concerns of conservative actors and could be interpreted as subtly sympathetic to the stance that there is a potential border crisis. It is worth noting that the article does not provide extensive counterpoints or quotes from groups who might express an opposing view on the Title 42 rule, which might suggest a slight bias toward the perspectives of those favoring the policy's continuation."
latimes,Immigration,"After more than a year of negotiation, settlement talks between the Biden administration and plaintiffs in a lawsuit over temporary protected status fell through on Tuesday, leaving more than 250,000 people at risk of deportation.

The litigation followed concerted actions by the Trump administration to end TPS for the citizens of several countries — El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan and Nepal — as part of its efforts to wind down extended use of the protections. TPS is a form of humanitarian relief granted to countries devastated by natural disasters or war and allows beneficiaries to work legally while they remain in the U.S. Created in 1990, the program currently applies to people from 15 countries.

The plaintiffs won temporary relief in 2018 when a federal district judge in San Francisco granted an injunction to block the termination of protections. But in 2020, a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed the order in a 2-1 decision. That hasn’t taken effect because lawyers for the immigrants requested a hearing before the full court, which remains pending.

The Biden administration redesignated temporary protected status for Haiti and Sudan, but has not done so for the four other countries. Those beneficiaries could lose their protections as early as the end of this year, while the Biden administration goes to court to defend the previous administration’s decisions.

As a presidential candidate, however, Joe Biden called President Trump’s decision to rescind TPS “a recipe for disaster,” promising to protect beneficiaries from being returned to unsafe countries. The Homeland Security and Justice departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Emi MacLean, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, said a settlement would have provided safety and security for the TPS holders who have felt vulnerable during the last four years of litigation.

“There is a reason that people are losing faith in the [Biden] administration,” she said. “These actions leave us very concerned about whether they recognize the urgency of this issue and the fact that many lives are on the line because of their unwillingness to act.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation but said that “current TPS holders from El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras will continue to be protected over the coming months.”

TPS holders and their U.S. citizen children brought the class-action challenge in 2018 alleging government officials had a political agenda in deciding to terminate protections for those countries and were motivated by racism. Trump administration officials countered by saying the program was never intended to provide a long-term reprieve.

Plaintiff Elsy Flores Ayala said she was frustrated that a settlement couldn’t be negotiated. Flores Ayala, 43, her husband and their 24-year-old daughter have had TPS since 2001, a year after they arrived in the U.S. from El Salvador.

El Salvador was first designated for TPS in March 2001 after two earthquakes ravaged the country, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing more than 1 million. Since then, the U.S. government has cited subsequent natural disasters and gang-related insecurity in redesignations. Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans have TPS, many of them in California.

Flores Ayala said she and her family, who live in Washington, depend on the benefits that come with TPS — she works in child care, her husband does maintenance at an apartment building and her daughter is in college. She also worries about what could happen if they lose the deportation protections. Her two youngest children, ages 17 and 21, were born in the U.S. and she fears being separated from them.

“The worry is significant because we don’t know what will happen with us,” she said.

In the pointed ruling in 2018, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocked the terminations, saying beneficiaries risked being uprooted from their homes, jobs and communities.

“They face removal to countries to which their children and family members may have little or no ties and which may not be safe,” he wrote. “Those with U.S.-citizen children will be confronted with the dilemma of either bringing their children with them, giving up their children’s lives in the United States (for many, the only lives they know), or being separated from their children.”

The judge, an appointee of President Obama, also cited Trump’s reported comments about Haitian and African immigrants being from “shithole countries,” noting “circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.”

Through the discovery process, lawyers for the immigrants received internal communications from the Homeland Security Department during the time the decisions for terminating TPS were made.

In one instance, then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke wrote in a personal memo in March 2018 that “the TPS program must end for these countries soon. … This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.”

Career diplomats and other experts cautioned at the time that the decisions would result in significant humanitarian and political repercussions, while a Homeland Security official suggested they comb through the conditions in those countries for “positive gems” to justify their arguments that recipients no longer needed legal protections.","Settlement discussions involving a lawsuit on temporary protected status (TPS) involving the current administration and representatives of the affected individuals did not reach resolution on Tuesday. As many as 250,000 individuals who benefitted from TPS may now face uncertainty regarding their status in the U.S.

The lawsuit in question was a response to decisions made to terminate TPS for people from El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan, and Nepal. TPS allows individuals from countries that experienced natural disasters or armed conflict to work and live in the U.S. without fear of deportation. While Haitians and Sudanese have seen their TPS redesignated, others await decisions that could potentially impact their status.

In a temporary victory for the plaintiffs in 2018, a U.S. district court in San Francisco issued an injunction preventing the termination of TPS. However, in 2020, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this injunction in a divided opinion, and further discussions in a larger panel are currently pending.

The administration has been urged to defend actions by the prior administration related to TPS in court, while facing criticism from some for not moving swiftly enough to resolve the uncertainty facing many TPS holders.

The Department of Homeland Security and Justice department were asked for comments but did not immediately provide a response.

Emi MacLean, an attorney involved in the case, noted the importance of a resolution for the safety and security of TPS holders, who have experienced a long period of litigation.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security stated they could not discuss the ongoing legal matters but assured that TPS holders from certain nations will still have protections in the near future.

The lawsuit also suggested that the decision to end TPS for several countries was influenced by ulterior motives. This was opposed by officials who maintained that TPS was never meant to be a permanent solution.

Elsy Flores Ayala, a TPS recipient, expressed her disappointment over not reaching a settlement. She and her family arrived in the U.S. from El Salvador and have been TPS holders since 2001, following significant earthquakes there. Almost 200,000 Salvadorans are TPS beneficiaries, and many, including Flores Ayala, are concerned about the potential impact on their lives and families if they were to lose their TPS benefits.

Back in 2018, the presiding judge over the initial injunction highlighted the potentially severe disruptions to TPS beneficiaries’ lives, including possible separation from family members.

Discovery in the lawsuit has uncovered communications from within the Homeland Security Department that shed light on the internal deliberations during the decision-making process on TPS terminations, including referencing viewpoints related to prioritizing national concerns.

Officials and specialists had previously warned that abrupt changes to TPS could carry substantive humanitarian and geopolitical consequences.","1. ""After more than a year of negotiation, settlement talks between the Biden administration and plaintiffs in a lawsuit over temporary protected status fell through on Tuesday, leaving more than 250,000 people at risk of deportation.""
- This introductory sentence sets a sympathetic tone towards the plight of the TPS beneficiaries, suggesting a bias towards immigrant rights and a viewpoint critical of the Biden administration's failure to secure an agreement that would protect these individuals.

2. ""The litigation followed concerted actions by the Trump administration to end TPS for the citizens of several countries... as part of its efforts to wind down extended use of the protections.""
- The phrase ""concerted actions"" implies deliberate and possibly negative intent by the Trump administration to remove protections from vulnerable groups, indicating an ideological stance that is critical of the previous administration's immigration policy.

3. ""Joe Biden called President Trump’s decision to rescind TPS 'a recipe for disaster,' promising to protect beneficiaries from being returned to unsafe countries.""
- The direct quotation of Biden's critical assessment of Trump's actions and his promise to offer protections indicates a viewpoint aligned with humanitarian concerns and criticizes the Trump administration's policy as harmful.

4. ""These actions leave us very concerned about whether they recognize the urgency of this issue and the fact that many lives are on the line because of their unwillingness to act.""
- Emi MacLean's quote presents the Biden administration as lacking urgency and will to act, criticizing it for not living up to its promises. This can be seen as a pro-immigrant perspective that demands action and expresses disappointment with the current administration's inaction.

5. ""Trump administration officials countered by saying the program was never intended to provide a long-term reprieve.""
- This presents the Trump administration's ideological stance that TPS is a temporary measure and not a pathway to long-term residency. The wording is neutral, but by contrasting it with the plaintiffs' perspective, it invites criticism of the administration's rigidity.

6. ""U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocked the terminations, saying beneficiaries risked being uprooted from their homes, jobs and communities.""
- The description of Judge Chen's ruling emphasizes the disruptive impact of ending TPS on individuals, suggesting an ideological view that emphasizes the human cost of immigration policies.

7. ""The judge, an appointee of President Obama, also cited Trump’s reported comments about Haitian and African immigrants being from 'shithole countries,' noting 'circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.'""
- By including this, the article draws attention to allegations of racism influencing the Trump administration's decisions. Referencing the derogatory comments attributed to Trump and tying these to judicial findings suggests an underlying criticism of the administration’s policy motives.

8. ""...then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke wrote in a personal memo... 'This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.'""
- The phrase ""America first"" connects to a nationalist ideology associated with the Trump administration. By including this quote, the article suggests that decisions about TPS were influenced by a political agenda that prioritized national interests over humanitarian concerns.

9. ""Career diplomats and other experts cautioned at the time that the decisions would result in significant humanitarian and political repercussions...""
- The appeal to the authority and expertise of career diplomats and experts serves to critique the decisions from a humanitarian perspective, implying that the administration's actions were contrary to expert advice and would cause harm both at home and abroad."
latimes,Police,"Five leaders of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing militia that played a leading role in storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, went on trial last week in Washington.

The defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the Yale-educated lawyer who founded the group, were charged with “seditious conspiracy”: plotting to attack the federal government by force to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election.

Prosecutors said Rhodes and others planned the assault on the Capitol, ordered their troops to bring “zombie killer tomahawks” and other weapons and stockpiled guns in hotels in case the battle escalated.

“We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” Rhodes told his followers in a text message, according to his indictment.

The trial, the first of several planned for ringleaders of the insurrection, has high stakes.

It’s the highest-profile prosecution so far in the Justice Department’s massive Jan. 6 dragnet.

It’s a rare use of “seditious conspiracy,” the U.S. equivalent of a domestic terrorism law, a charge that dates back to the Civil War. The defendants aren’t accused of committing violent acts but of organizing the squad that did.

And it may have crippled the Oath Keepers, a 13-year-old militia recruited largely from military veterans and law enforcement officers that styled itself as the armed vanguard of the militant right.

“As an organization, the Oath Keepers have lost a lot of steam from this,” said Jon Lewis, a terrorism scholar at George Washington University. “Members have distanced themselves from the leadership. Their brand has become toxic.”

But the prosecutions haven’t put a perceptible dent in the larger phenomenon of right-wing extremism, an ecosystem that includes white supremacists, antigovernment militants and many (but far from all) supporters of former President Trump.

For example, the Proud Boys, another militia whose leader, Enrique Tarrio, and four lieutenants are scheduled to go on trial on similar charges in December. The Proud Boys aren’t shrinking; they appear to be expanding.

“Their leadership has been decimated, but we’ve seen increased activity at a local level,” Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League told me. “They keep adding new chapters ... and their agenda has diversified; they’re showing up at school board meetings and campaigning on LGBTQ issues.”

The militant right has survived Jan. 6 in other forms too.

“It’s a mistake to focus on the militias,” said Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, who has studied the Jan. 6 rioters.

“Almost 90% of the Jan. 6 defendants were not militia members,” he said. “What made Jan. 6 happen was not Oath Keepers or Proud Boys. It was a larger movement that includes many mainstream Trump supporters too. ... The militias are only the most visible part.”

Based on public opinion surveys, about 18 million Americans believe violence is justified to restore Trump to the White House, Pape estimates. Other polls have suggested even larger numbers.

Terrorism scholars say the extremist right is surviving not on the strength of its organizations but on a powerful narrative that appeals to millions of discontented conservatives.

A key part of that narrative is the conviction, fed by Trump and his allies, that Democrats stole the 2020 election and will continue using illegitimate means to prevent conservatives from winning.

Now add one more phenomenon, something scholars call “stochastic terrorism”: seemingly random, lone-wolf attacks inspired by the statements of leaders like Trump.

“We have people with massive megaphones saying we need to do something to stop a corrupt FBI, or an Internal Revenue Service that’s about to send 87,000 armed agents into your homes,” said Lewis, referring to the plan to hire 87,000 IRS employees, most of whom will not be enforcement agents.

“Some people’s response to those messages is not ‘I should go vote.’ It’s ‘I should pick up my gun and head for the nearest federal building.’”

If Republican leaders, including Trump, don’t intend that to be the effect of their words, there’s a simple remedy: They could denounce violence in all its forms — including the violence of Trump supporters on Jan. 6.

Too often, they don’t.

Their political winking at violence makes a difficult task — fighting domestic terrorism while respecting civil liberties — even harder.

“It’s impossible for law enforcement to chase down every right-wing extremist who posts messages on the internet and also owns a firearm,” said Lewis.

All of which means this wave of violent extremism on the right is far from over.

Before the 2020 presidential election, Trump was asked what his message was for the Proud Boys, who even then were issuing threats of violence.

His answer was indulgent. “Stand back and stand by,” he said.

As congressional elections approach next month, and a presidential campaign soon after, they are standing by again.","Five leaders of the Oath Keepers, a group that played a significant role in the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, went on trial last week in Washington.

The defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the Yale-educated lawyer who founded the group, were charged with plotting to attack the federal government by force to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election.

Prosecutors alleged that Rhodes and others laid plans for the assault on the Capitol, instructed their members to bring weapons and had stored firearms in hotels nearby as a contingency for escalation.

Rhodes, according to his indictment, had messaged his followers about the inevitability of conflict given the political climate.

The trial marks a significant moment in the series of legal actions stemming from the incidents of January 6th, touching on rare legal charges that hark back to the Civil War era. The defendants are primarily accused of coordination and planning rather than direct acts of violence.

The trial also appears to have affected the Oath Keepers organization, with some distancing themselves from the leadership and a general decline in the group's activities and influence.

However, the effect on the broader array of groups and ideologies that harbor extreme views is less clear. Other groups, such as the Proud Boys, continue to be active and are drawing attention in different community and political areas.

Scholars point out that a concern for policymakers and law enforcement is the persistence of narratives that justify extreme measures, influenced by prominent figures, and the idea that election outcomes were illegitimately influenced.

The concept known as ""stochastic terrorism"" is an additional challenge, where isolated acts of violence are potentially incited by the rhetoric from public figures.

To mitigate this phenomenon, it's suggested that political leaders could more explicitly denounce any form of violence and the actions of individuals on January 6th.

A comprehensive approach by law enforcement to mitigate the risk of violence while upholding civil liberties, made more complex by various factors, is still an ongoing challenge.

This complex issue, reflecting varying levels of dissatisfaction and the potential for extremist actions, remains a part of the current social and political landscape as the country moves towards upcoming elections.","1. ""right-wing militia""
   - Context/Meaning: This phrase implies that the Oath Keepers are not just a militia, but specifically aligned with the right end of the political spectrum. The term ""right-wing"" suggests a conservative, traditionalist, or reactionary ideology that may be in opposition to more liberal or progressive perspectives.

2. ""storming the Capitol""
   - Context/Meaning: The use of the word ""storming"" is loaded and connotes a violent, aggressive action, which portrays the event as an attack rather than a protest or demonstration. This choice of words suggests a negative view of the actions taken by the individuals involved.

3. ""seditious conspiracy""
   - Context/Meaning: Labeling the charge as ""seditious conspiracy"" carries connotations of a serious threat to the stability and governance of the country—highlighting the gravity of the alleged offense and suggesting a severe breach of law and order that aligns with an ideology that values legal structures and the rule of law.

4. ""zombie killer tomahawks""
   - Context/Meaning: Quoting the term ""zombie killer tomahawks"" emphasizes the extremism and perceived absurdity of the militia's preparation. This descriptor creates an image of irrational and potentially fanatical behavior.

5. ""ringleaders of the insurrection""
   - Context/Meaning: The term ""insurrection"" indicates a rebellion against authority, government, or established order. Referring to the individuals as ""ringleaders"" suggests they were central figures orchestrating what is framed as an insurrection, pointing to an ideology that perceives the events of January 6 as an attack on democracy.

6. ""militant right""
   - Context/Meaning: The term ""militant"" implies aggression and a propensity for violence, and coupling it with ""right"" suggests that this aggression is a characteristic of conservative or right-wing politics, which may imply a viewpoint critical of right-wing extremism.

7. ""Their brand has become toxic.""
   - Context/Meaning: This statement from a terrorism scholar indicates that the reputation of the Oath Keepers has been severely damaged, suggesting a stance that the actions associated with the Oath Keepers are widely considered reprehensible.

8. ""right-wing extremism""
   - Context/Meaning: Grouping various movements (white supremacists, antigovernment militants, Trump supporters) under the umbrella of ""right-wing extremism"" denotes a broad, ideologically driven threat from the right side of the political spectrum.

9. ""18 million Americans believe violence is justified""
   - Context/Meaning: Including this statistic without explicit condemnation implies concern about a large group of people holding extremist views, which aligns with an ideology that may find such views dangerous or unacceptable.

10. ""stochastic terrorism""
    - Context/Meaning: Discussing the concept of ""stochastic terrorism"" portrays a view that leaders (implied to be like Trump) bear responsibility for violence incited by their rhetoric, which suggests an ideology that advocates for responsible speech and accountability.

11. ""Their political winking at violence""
    - Context/Meaning: This phrase accuses some Republican leaders of tacitly endorsing violent acts. The ""winking"" metaphor conveys a belief that these leaders are surreptitiously encouraging aggressive behavior, which may resonate with an ideological position that condemns the normalization of political violence.

12. ""Stand back and stand by""
    - Context/Meaning: By highlighting Trump's response to the Proud Boys, the writer is inferring that Trump’s message was permissive and suggestive of potential future actions. This choice to recall Trump's exact words is intended to underscore a perceived ongoing threat aligned with an ideology critical of ambiguous or seemingly complicit responses to extremism."
latimes,Police,"Here’s a look at some of the major cases to be heard by the Supreme Court in the term beginning Oct. 3.

Are Harvard and the University of North Carolina violating the Constitution and federal civil rights law by giving an edge to qualified Black and Latino applicants and by discriminating against Asian American students?

Since the 1978 Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke case, the court has held that colleges and universities may consider race as a “plus factor” for Black and Latino applicants to create a more diverse class.

But the court’s conservatives have long opposed this affirmative action, and they contend the law prohibits consideration of an applicant’s race.

Students for Fair Admission vs. Harvard and SFFA vs. UNC will be argued Oct. 31.

Does the Voting Rights Act call for fair and equal representation for Blacks and Latinos, sometimes requiring states to draw election districts likely to elect a Black or Latino candidate?

Lawyers for Alabama call this a form of “racial segregation” and urge the court to adopt a “race neutral” rule that frees states from this duty of fair representation for racial minorities.

About 27% of Alabama residents are Black, but only one of seven congressional districts had a Black majority under the state’s map.

Merrill vs. Milligan will be argued Oct. 4.

Does a state legislature have an “independent” and exclusive power to set the rules for federal elections, or can the state supreme court or the governor play a role as well?

This case arose when North Carolina’s Republican legislators drew a highly partisan election map that would ensure 10 of 14 congressional seats would be held by the GOP.

But the state Supreme Court ruled the map was unfair and violated the state constitution, and the judges drew a new map. Now Republican legislators are urging justices to rule the map-making power is theirs alone.

Election law experts fear such a ruling could embolden partisan lawmakers to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.

Moore vs. Harper will be heard in December.

Does a Colorado website designer who is a conservative Christian have a free-speech right to refuse to work on wedding plans for a same-sex couple, or does this discrimination violate the state’s civil rights law?

Four years ago, the justices wrestled with this question in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case involving a baker of wedding cakes but failed to decide the free-speech question.

A ruling for the Colorado plaintiff could affect California and 20 other states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation.

303Creative vs. Elenis will be heard in December.

Can wetlands usually be protected from development under the Clean Water Act or only if they are part of a permanent and flowing body of water?

Federal law says the Environmental Protection Agency may protect the “waters of the United States” from pollutants, but it is not clear whether the agency’s authority extends to seasonal streams or soggy land that is not directly connected to a lake, river or bay.

Sackett vs. EPA will be argued on Oct. 3.

Can California voters require that pork meat sold in the state come from farms where animals are not “abused” and where breeding pigs are given enough room to stand and turn around?

Midwest farmers say 99% of the pork sold in California comes from outside the state, and they say the state’s rules would force them to make costly changes in their operation.

The court will hear their complaint that Proposition 12 of 2018 is unconstitutional because it interferes with interstate commerce.

National Pork Producers Council vs. Ross will be argued on Oct. 11.

Can the Biden administration enforce guidelines that call for arresting and deporting only immigrants who pose a current danger to public safety, or does the law require arresting and removing anyone with a criminal record or final order of removal?

The administration argued immigration officials have always had broad discretion in enforcing the law, but a judge in Texas blocked the use of the new guidelines.

And by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court in July refused an emergency request to lift the judge’s order.

U.S. vs. Texas is likely to be heard in December.

Does the Indian Child Welfare Act interfere with a state’s power over adoptions and foster case, and unfairly limit adoptions by parents who are not members of the child’s tribe?

Congress adopted the measure in 1978 to prevent Native American children from being removed from tribes, but Texas and three couples sued contending the law goes too far.

Haaland vs. Brackeen will be heard Nov. 9.

Did Andy Warhol make fair use of Lynn Goldsmith’s 1981 photograph of Prince by transforming it into something new and different in 1984 with his Prince series of silkscreens, or did he violate her copyright because his work was clearly derived from hers?

This is an important question of copyright law since judges are divided over whether adaptations of copyrighted material can be freely used if they are sufficiently “transformative.”

Andy Warhol Foundation vs. Goldsmith will be argued Oct. 12.","Here’s a look at some of the major cases to be heard by the Supreme Court in the term beginning Oct. 3.

The Supreme Court will consider whether race-based admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina are consistent with the Constitution and federal law. The policies in question aim to increase diversity in the student body but have raised concerns over whether they unfairly impact Asian American applicants.

The pivotal case, Students for Fair Admission vs. Harvard and SFFA vs. UNC, is set to be argued Oct. 31.

In Merrill vs. Milligan, to be argued Oct. 4, the court will examine the requirements of the Voting Rights Act as they pertain to the drawing of election districts and whether certain practices provide equitable opportunity for representation of various racial groups in Alabama.

The Supreme Court is set to decide on the scope of a state legislature's powers regarding federal election rules in Moore vs. Harper. This comes after North Carolina’s election map was struck down by the state Supreme Court for being unfair. The case will be heard in December, with significant implications for the conduct of elections.

The court will also revisit the question of freedom of speech and anti-discrimination laws in the context of a Colorado website designer's refusal to work on same-sex wedding projects due to personal beliefs. The case, 303Creative vs. Elenis, follows a similar case from four years prior and will be heard in December.

Environmental law will come into focus with Sackett vs. EPA, set for Oct. 3, where the court will review the extent to which wetlands can be protected from development under the Clean Water Act, examining the definition and regulatory reach concerning wetlands.

In matters of commerce and state regulation, the National Pork Producers Council vs. Ross, to be argued on Oct. 11, will determine whether California voters can mandate animal welfare standards for pork sold in the state, standards that would have nationwide implications for pork producers.

Immigration policies will be scrutinized in U.S. vs. Texas, as the court reviews the Biden administration's enforcement guidelines prioritizing the deportation of immigrants who pose a threat to public safety. The case, likely to be heard in December, questions the discretion afforded to immigration officials in the application of removal laws.

The court will also consider the Indian Child Welfare Act in Haaland vs. Brackeen, scheduled for Nov. 9, which concerns the balance of state powers and federal law in the context of adoptions and foster care related to Native American children.

Lastly, in the realm of copyright law, the court will hear arguments in Andy Warhol Foundation vs. Goldsmith on Oct. 12, to resolve a dispute over the fair use doctrine and whether Warhol’s adaptation of a photograph constitutes a transformative work.","The article contains various phrases and descriptions that allude to the underlying political ideologies. Below are instances within the article along with explanations for each:

1. ""...giving an edge to qualified Black and Latino applicants and by discriminating against Asian American students"" - This phrase suggests a viewpoint consistent with those who argue against affirmative action practices, framing them as discriminatory towards Asian American students.

2. ""But the court’s conservatives have long opposed this affirmative action..."" - Highlighting the opposition of the ""court's conservatives"" to affirmative action indicates that the conservative justices may have an ideological belief against the use of race in college admissions. This sets the stage for a conflict between liberal and conservative ideologies within the court.

3. ""Lawyers for Alabama call this a form of 'racial segregation'..."" - Labeling measures designed to ensure fair representation of minorities as ""racial segregation"" frames affirmative steps towards racial equity as a negative phenomenon; a viewpoint typically held by those on the conservative end of the ideological spectrum who prefer race-neutral policies.

4. ""...Republican legislators drew a highly partisan election map..."" - The use of the term ""highly partisan"" to describe the election map suggests that the actions of the Republican legislators were excessively biased in favor of their party, a viewpoint that criticizes partisan gerrymandering, typically associated with those who advocate for fair elections.

5. ""Election law experts fear such a ruling could embolden partisan lawmakers to interfere with the 2024 presidential election."" - The use of the word ""fear"" reflects a concern that is often raised by those who believe in protecting the integrity of democratic processes from extreme partisan manipulation.

6. ""Does a Colorado website designer who is a conservative Christian have a free-speech right to refuse...""
   - The description of the website designer includes both the political (""conservative"") and religious (""Christian"") descriptors, indicating a potential clash between social conservatism and anti-discrimination laws.

7. ""Can wetlands usually be protected from development under the Clean Water Act..."" - The debate over what constitutes ""waters of the United States"" suggests a tension between environmental regulation, favored by more progressive ideologies, and restricted government regulation, supported by conservative views.

8. ""Midwest farmers say 99% of the pork sold in California comes from outside the state, and they say the state’s rules would force them to make costly changes..."" - Emphasizing the farmers' grievances about economic impact reflects a concern for the balance between state regulations and economic freedoms, which is often highlighted in libertarian or free-market ideologies.

nationalreview,Abortion,"The Idaho House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy It includes a Texas-style mechanism that leaves enforcement to private citizens, rather than the state government, to sue abortion providers.

In a 51-to-14 vote, the state House approved the measure after the Senate passed it earlier this month. It now goes to the desk of Republican governor Brad Little, who is expected to enact it.

The legislation borrows from a Texas version that went into effect in September in that it allows any private individual to sue anyone who performs, aids, or abets an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around six weeks of gestation. However, the Idaho bill permits only family members, including the unborn baby’s father, siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, to file a lawsuit against the provider. The enforcement provision includes an exception for rape, forbidding the rapist involved in a pregnancy from suing a provider (but allowing relatives of the rapist to sue), as well as incest and medical emergencies, to protect the life of the mother.

The Supreme Court dismissed an opportunity to review the Texas law in September, allowing it to become active in the state, but it has allowed challenges from abortion clinics to proceed against state licensing officials. After many months of litigation, the state supreme court denied the petition of abortion providers in Texas in an unanimous ruling, declaring that licensing officials have no authority, direct or indirect, to enforce the Texas Heartbeat Act. For Texas abortion providers, violation of the Heartbeat Act probably means expensive litigation.

There is an Idaho fetal-heartbeat law on the books that deems it a felony for any medical practice to provide an abortion after a heartbeat is detected. The penalty is up to five years in prison. However, that law includes a “trigger” provision with the condition that a court must turn over a favorable ruling on a similar law somewhere in the country for it to go into effect.

Like the Texas law, the Idaho bill would allow plaintiffs to seek monetary damages, cash payments of $20,000, as well as legal fee amounts, from the abortion provider. Petitioners can sue up to four years after the date of the abortion.

The Idaho legislative action comes as the Supreme Court is scheduled to weigh in on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a landmark abortion case concerning a Mississippi law that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That cases forces the court to examine the standard of fetal viability, or 24–28 weeks of gestation, and whether abortion should be allowed prior to that. If the high court rules in favor of the Mississippi ban, Roe will effectively be reversed, deferring the issue to the states to create their own legislation permitting or barring abortion at various stages of pregnancy.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","The Idaho House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that implements significant restrictions on abortion, allowing it only up to six weeks of pregnancy. This legislation permits lawsuits brought by private citizens against those who perform or assist in an abortion procedure after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, which usually occurs around the six-week mark.

The measure passed with a majority, receiving a 51-to-14 vote in the state House after being approved by the Senate. The governor is soon expected to review the legislation.

Drawing inspiration from a similar law in Texas, the Idaho bill allows family members related to the unborn child to initiate legal action against the abortion provider. The bill includes exceptions for cases of rape, where the perpetrator cannot bring a lawsuit, as well as incest and medical emergencies, to protect the life of the mother.

When reviewing a similar law from Texas, the Supreme Court did not take up the case, but it did permit abortion providers to bring legal challenges against certain state officials. After extended legal proceedings, the Texas Supreme Court concluded that licensing officials cannot enforce the related Texas law.

In Idaho, there is an existing law that criminalizes the provision of an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, punishable by up to five years in prison. This law, however, will only come into effect if there is a favorable court ruling on a similar statute from another region.

The disputed Idaho bill also entitles plaintiffs to claim financial damages and legal costs from the abortion provider involved, with a statute of limitations extending up to four years after the abortion.

The judicial system is currently preparing for a significant case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, regarding a different state's law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. This case will challenge the Supreme Court to examine abortion laws and may alter the landscape of abortion rights in the United States.

For additional information on this developing story, please reach out to the news team.","1. ""prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy""
   - This phrase suggests a politically conservative or pro-life viewpoint, as it describes restrictive legislation on abortion, aligning with conservative efforts to limit abortion access. Six weeks is often before many women know they are pregnant, and emphasizing this early deadline implies support for the restrictive legislation.

2. ""Texas-style mechanism""
   - The term ""Texas-style"" refers to the unique legal approach Texas took regarding abortion laws, which is predominantly supported by the conservative movement. By using this term, the article contextualizes Idaho's law as following a controversial conservative strategy of enlisting private citizens to enforce abortion restrictions.

3. ""Republican governor Brad Little, who is expected to enact it.""
   - The mention of the governor's political affiliation (Republican) alongside the anticipation of him enacting the bill implies that the legislation aligns with Republican or conservative ideologies, which typically endorse stronger abortion restrictions.

4. ""allows any private individual to sue anyone who performs, aids, or abets an abortion""
   - This part of the law empowers private individuals to act against abortion providers, suggesting an ideology that seeks to deputize citizens in the enforcement of conservative social policies, which underscores a distrust of state enforcement mechanisms or preference for privatized enforcement when it comes to moral or social issues among conservative circles.

5. ""The Supreme Court dismissed an opportunity to review...it has allowed challenges from abortion clinics to proceed""
   - The description of the Supreme Court's actions hints at a narrative of judicial restraint or conservatism, by noting a missed opportunity to review a law with impactful societal implications (thus implicitly supporting its existence), while also allowing legal challenges that could be seen as attempts to undermine the law.

6. ""Idaho fetal-heartbeat law...deems it a felony""
   - The framing of the legislation with the term ""fetal-heartbeat law"" uses language often found in pro-life advocacy, focusing on the developmental milestone of a detectable heartbeat to assert the humanity of the fetus and support for legislation restricting abortion on this basis.

7. ""trigger provision...for it to go into effect.""
   - The phrase ""trigger provision"" alludes to the conservative legislative strategy of preparing for a potential shift in federal jurisprudence that would allow more restrictive state-level abortion laws, which is in tune with a legally strategic, long-term conservative goal to overturn Roe v. Wade and restrict abortion access.

8. ""The Supreme Court is scheduled to weigh in on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization""
   - This reference to a pivotal Supreme Court case indicates an engagement with the highest level of judicial review concerning abortion and suggests anticipation of a conservative victory that could lead to the dismantling of Roe v. Wade protections, aligning with the goal of many in the conservative movement to allow states the right to limit or ban abortion.

Overall, the use of language in this article points towards a conservative-leaning, pro-life ideology, emphasized through the choice of phrases and descriptors that align with positions typically supported by conservative politicians and pro-life advocates."
nationalreview,Abortion,"During the second day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Tuesday, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson refused to define what a “woman” is, deferring instead to scientific experts.

When asked to define “woman” by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, she replied, “I can’t…I’m not a biologist.” Blackburn shot back, “The meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can’t give me a definition?”

“Senator, in my work as a judge, what I do is I address disputes. If there’s a dispute about a definition, people make arguments and I look at the law and I decide,” Jackson added, reiterating the methodical judicial approach she has historically applied.

Given the way the transgender debate has escalated, some Republicans are concerned about the future adjudication of cases dealing with gender identity, since some are likely to end up on the Supreme Court docket. As a nominee to the High Court, Jackson will continue to face scrutiny over her opinions on a range of cultural issues important to conservatives, including abortion, transgenderism, and racialized public school curricula.

During the Tuesday confirmation hearing, Blackburn pressed Jackson on critical race theory and whether it should be outlawed in public schools. Republican senators are likely to attempt to nail Jackson on her stance on abortion in the coming days.

“The fact that you can’t give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about,” Blackburn said. She cited the NCAA championship last weekend, where transgender athlete Lia Thomas outperformed and out-placed multiple female swimmers, some former Olympians, stripping them of their chances of advancing to finals.

“What message do you think this sends to girls who aspire to compete and win in sports at the highest levels?,” the senator asked.

Blackburn also questioned Jackson about her stance on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, which challenges the precedent set by the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade and which is currently before the Court.

“Do you commit to respecting the Court’s decision if it rules that Roe was wrongly decided and that the issue of abortion should be sent back to the states?” Blackburn asked.

“Whatever the Supreme Court decides in Dobbs will be the precedent of the Supreme Court. It will be worthy of respect in the sense that it is the precedent. I commit to treating it as I would any other precedent,” Jackson replied.

In the last couple of years, multiple Republican-dominated states, notably Florida and most recently Iowa, have passed or enacted legislation prohibiting the inclusion of biological men in women’s sports at the K-12 and collegiate levels. However, Republican governors in Indiana and Utah vetoed such legislation this week.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","During the second day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson was asked to provide a definition of “woman” by Senator Marsha Blackburn. Jackson responded by saying, “I can’t…I’m not a biologist,” indicating her intention to refrain from providing a scientific definition.

Blackburn highlighted the complexity of the term, to which Jackson elaborated, “Senator, in my role as a judge, my responsibility is to resolve disputes. When there is a dispute about a definition, I consider the arguments presented and apply the law to reach a decision,” emphasizing her commitment to judicial process.

The evolving debate around transgender issues has prompted some lawmakers to question how these issues will be handled in future Supreme Court cases. As a High Court nominee, Jackson is being carefully examined by some senators for her viewpoints on a variety of legal matters, including those related to gender identity.

At Tuesday's hearing, Senator Blackburn also questioned Jackson about her views on critical race theory in education. It is anticipated that senators may also delve into Jackson's perspectives on reproductive rights in subsequent sessions.

Blackburn expressed concern regarding the influence of certain educational philosophies on foundational concepts, using the example of the recent NCAA swimming championship, where transgender athlete Lia Thomas competed and was successful. Blackburn questioned the potential implications for girls in sports with such developments.

Additionally, Blackburn inquired about the potential for the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health to affect the precedent set by Roe v. Wade. Jackson maintained that any decision in the case of Dobbs would establish a new precedent that she would respect as with any other.

In recent times, bills have been introduced in various states with differing positions on the involvement of transgender individuals in sports. For instance, Florida and Iowa have passed legislation related to transgender participation in sports. In contrast, governors in Indiana and Utah have taken actions to veto similar proposals this week.","The language and rhetoric in this article suggest a conservative or right-leaning bias, particularly favoring Republican ideologies. Below are instances that illustrate this:

1. ""Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson refused to define what a “woman” is, deferring instead to scientific experts.""
- This framing implies a negative connotation to Judge Jackson's decision not to define the term. The word ""refused"" suggests being uncooperative or evasive, a framing that indicates an ideological stance critical of a progressive approach to gender identities.

2. ""the meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial""
- The declaration of the term ""woman"" as ""unclear and controversial"" indicates an underlying view that gender identity debates are fraught and problematic, denoting a right-leaning perspective that aligns with traditional gender definitions.

3. ""concerned about the future adjudication of cases dealing with gender identity""
- The expression of concern over the adjudication of gender identity cases implies that gender identity is a politically sensitive and potentially negative topic within the realm of judicial decisions, a viewpoint often held by conservatives.

4. ""a range of cultural issues important to conservatives, including abortion, transgenderism, and racialized public school curricula.""
- The language used here, particularly ""transgenderism"" and ""racialized,"" tends to signal a conservative bias. These terms are commonly used in conservative circles to describe progressive stances on transgender rights and race-related educational content, framing them as divisive or controversial.

5. ""the dangers of the kind of progressive education""
- The term ""dangers"" associated with ""progressive education"" suggests a strong conservative bias, casting progressive policies and education materials in a negative light as something to be wary of.

6. ""transgender athlete Lia Thomas outperformed and out-placed multiple female swimmers""
- The framing of the issue around transgender athletes focuses on the competitive disadvantages to cisgender women, a common concern raised by conservatives in the debate over trans participation in sports.

7. ""stripping them of their chances""
- The word ""stripping"" conveys a forceful taking away of opportunities, aligning with a conservative viewpoint that sees the inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports as undermining the rights and achievements of cisgender female athletes.

8. ""Republican-dominated states...have passed or enacted legislation""
- The mention of ""Republican-dominated states"" passing legislation implies a favorable view towards actions taken by conservative lawmakers, particularly when contrasted with the following mention of Republican governors' vetoes, which could be seen as a failure to align with the broader conservative agenda.

9. ""prohibiting the inclusion of biological men in women’s sports""
- The use of the term ""biological men"" rather than ""transgender women"" indicates a conservative perspective, emphasizing a binary and biological view of gender.

The overall use of language and the framing of the confirmation hearing events in this article reflect a conservative bias, particularly focusing on areas of conservative concern such as gender identity, critical race theory, and abortion rights."
nationalreview,COVID,"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that the agency is working to “pivot the language” around who qualifies as fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to instead focus on who is as “up-to-date” with their shots as they “should be.”

“What we really are working to do is pivot the language to make sure that everybody is as up to date with their Covid-19 vaccine as they personally could be, should be, based on when they got their last vaccine,” Walensky said.

“We really want to make sure people are up-to-date,” she added. “That means if you recently got your second dose, you’re not eligible for a booster, you’re up-to-date. If you are eligible for a booster and you haven’t gotten it, you’re not up-to-date and you need to get your booster in order to be up-to-date.”

Walensky’s comment comes days after President Biden dodged a question on why the White House hasn’t changed the definition of “fully vaccinated” against Covid-19 to include a third booster shot and if the reason is that the number of fully-vaccinated Americans would suddenly look a lot less impressive.

He claimed that was not the reason the definition hadn’t been updated. When a reporter pressed him again he responded: “The answer is yes, get the booster shot it’s all part of the same thing. You’re better protected.”

With officials pushing Americans to receive their booster shots, many believed it was only a matter of time before the definition of “fully vaccinated” would shift from meaning two shots of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, to including a booster shot. A shifting definition could change the requirements of vaccine mandates across the country, including requirements for health care workers.

While the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers last week, the justices allowed a vaccine mandate for health-care workers at facilities that receive federal funding to go into effect.

CDC data show 39 percent of fully vaccinated people have gotten booster shots. However, some people may not be eligible for an additional shot yet if not enough time has passed since their most recent shot.

Meanwhile, three reports released Friday showed vaccine boosters provide robust protection against severe disease from the omicron variant in the U.S.

Data collected between August 2021 and January 5, 2022, show a third dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines was 90 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and 82 percent effective in preventing a trip to the emergency room or urgent care.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that the agency is updating communication strategies around vaccination status against Covid-19 to more accurately reflect current recommendations on vaccine dosing. 

Walensky stated, ""Our goal is to ensure that everyone's vaccination status corresponds appropriately with the timing of their last vaccine dose, in alignment with the latest recommendations.""

""We aim to make sure everyone's vaccination status is current,"" she further noted. ""For example, if you received your second dose recently and aren’t yet eligible for a booster, your vaccinations are considered current. On the other hand, if you’re eligible for a booster and have yet to receive it, you should seek to get your booster to maintain a current vaccination status.""

This change in communication comes after President Biden reiterated the importance of receiving booster shots when discussing the definition of being fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

Officials are encouraging citizens to get booster shots, predicting that the criteria for being fully vaccinated could evolve to include the additional dose. This would potentially affect the structure of vaccine requirements in various sectors, including health care.

Despite a recent ruling by the Supreme Court to halt a wider vaccine-or-test mandate for large businesses, the court did permit a vaccine requirement for health care workers in federally funded facilities to take effect.

Current CDC data reveals that 39 percent of fully vaccinated individuals have opted to get booster shots. Eligibility for the booster dose is dependent on the timing of the last vaccination.

Recent reports demonstrate that vaccine boosters enhance protection against severe disease caused by the omicron variant in the U.S. The studies, spanning from August 2021 to January 5, 2022, indicate that a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines was 90 percent effective in preventing hospitalizations, with an 82 percent efficacy in preventing visits to emergency or urgent care due to Covid-19.

nationalreview,COVID,"A key measure of inflation jumped 5.8 percent in December compared to one year earlier, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Friday.

The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, the Commerce Department’s Personal Consumption Expenditures index, increased again last month, after previously hitting 5.7 percent in November.

The December spike was the largest since 1982.

Meanwhile, the core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.9 percent year-over-year.

The figures follow a Labor Department report released earlier this month that showed the consumer price index, a major inflation gauge, surged 0.5 percent in December and 7.0 percent for the last twelve months ending in December, representing the largest annual spike since June 1982, when inflation hit 7.1 percent.

President Biden has claimed that supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is partially to blame for the rising inflation. Biden’s National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, called the price increases a “global phenomenon” that “reflect the nature of the global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis” and recovery earlier this month.

Deese said during a White House press briefing that the U.S. is in a “uniquely strong economic position” despite Americans encountering rising prices and empty shelves in stores across the country.

He crafted a story in which the U.S. had excelled economically last year, noting that it experienced the largest decline in unemployment, most jobs created and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. However, he failed to acknowledge that those figures come in the wake of record destruction on the economy brought on by the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Biden has been patting himself on the back after the U.S. gross domestic product grew at 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter. He called the growth “no accident.”

“My economic strategy is creating good jobs for Americans, rebuilding our manufacturing, and strengthening our supply chains here at home to help make our companies more competitive,” Biden said.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it will likely raise interest rates in March in an effort to temper an overheating economy and soaring inflation.

“The committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that the conditions are appropriate for doing so,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said at a press briefing.

He added that inflation “has not gotten better. It has probably gotten a bit worse. . . . To the extent that situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to reflect that,” Reuters reported. “This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy we put in place to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic.”

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","In December, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which the Federal Reserve uses to track inflation, rose by 5.8 percent when compared to the previous year, as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This increase followed a 5.7 percent rise in November and it marked the sharpest incline since 1982.

Additionally, the core PCE index, which removes the effects of food and energy prices due to their volatile nature, went up by 4.9 percent from the year before.

These figures were released after the Labor Department reported earlier in the month that the consumer price index increased by 0.5 percent for December, and by 7.0 percent for the year ending in December. This annual rise was the most significant since June 1982, when inflation rates reached 7.1 percent.

President Biden has indicated that disruptions in the supply chain attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic have played a role in the recent inflation increase. The director of Biden’s National Economic Council, Brian Deese, referred to these price surges as part of ""a global challenge"" that countries face while managing the recovery from a pandemic crisis.

During a White House press briefing, Deese pointed out that the country had seen robust economic indicators, including reductions in unemployment, job creation, and economic growth, which were notable compared to the preceding 40 years. He did not, however, discuss the economic impacts experienced during the early stages of the pandemic that might have affected these figures.

Biden recently discussed the growth in the U.S. gross domestic product, which accelerated by 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter, and mentioned that this was a result of his administration's economic policies, such as creating jobs, revitalizing manufacturing, and fortifying domestic supply chains.

To address concerns about the economy and the rise in inflation, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it is considering increasing interest rates in March. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, emphasized the importance of such a move if the economic circumstances deem it necessary, highlighting the Fed's commitment to adjusting policy in response to current inflation trends. Powell also noted in a press briefing that the situation with inflation might have worsened and a policy shift would be forthcoming to mitigate further economic challenges.","The article you've provided appears to present information related to inflation rates, economic indices, and quotes from government officials. To analyze it for underlying political ideology, let's examine specific phrases and word choices that may suggest a particular bias or viewpoint:

1. “President Biden has claimed...” 
- This phrase could suggest a skeptical stance towards President Biden’s statements, as the word ""claimed"" may imply a question about the validity or completeness of his explanation.

2. ""Deese said during a White House press briefing that the U.S. is in a 'uniquely strong economic position' despite Americans encountering rising prices and empty shelves in stores across the country.""
- This part offers a contrasting picture that could be taken to highlight perceived inconsistencies in the administration's narrative, juxtaposing asserted economic strength with the consumer experiences that suggest otherwise.

3. “He crafted a story in which the U.S. had excelled economically last year...”
- Use of the phrase ""crafted a story"" implies that the official is constructing a narrative, which might suggest a manipulation or spin on the actual situation, indicative of skepticism toward the official’s viewpoint.

4. “However, he failed to acknowledge...”
- Pointing out a failure to acknowledge certain information suggests an omission that may be intentional or highlight a perceived lack of transparency, signaling critical perspective towards the officials.

5. “Biden has been patting himself on the back after the U.S. gross domestic product grew at 6.9 percent...”
- The phrase ""patting himself on the back"" is often used negatively to describe self-congratulatory behavior, suggesting the author believes Biden is overly crediting himself or his policies for positive economic indicators.

6. “My economic strategy is creating good jobs for Americans...”
- This direct quote from President Biden is presented without immediate critical commentary, letting the statement stand on its own merits.

7. “The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it will likely raise interest rates in March...”
- This is a neutral statement of intended policy action by the Federal Reserve, provided without much editorial framing.

8. “...our policy will have to reflect that,” Reuters reported.
- Citing Reuters lends credibility to the statement by appealing to an authoritative source, suggesting a reliance on recognized newswires for accurate information.

The language and tone of the article, particularly with use of terms like “claimed,” “crafted a story,” “patting himself on the back,” and “failed to acknowledge,” suggest a critical view of President Biden and his administration’s handling of or statements regarding the economy. This critical stance could indicate an ideological bias that leans toward skepticism of the current administration, perhaps conservative or libertarian, with an emphasis on drawing attention to the issues in the economy and questioning government officials' characterizations of the economic situation."
nationalreview,Climate Change,"Following President Biden’s announcement of a punitive sanctions package against Russia as retaliation for its creeping incursion into Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Tuesday that Americans should expect already sky-high energy prices to climb further.

During a press briefing, multiple reporters asked Psaki to address the cost burden Americans might incur as a result of the sanctions, which target Russian oligarchs and certain banks and aim to cut off the country from western financing. Germany also officially cancelled operation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as punishment. The pipeline was built to supply European nations with natural gas from Russia.

A reporter asked, “So, Americans should expect higher gasoline prices?” to which Psaki replied, “Yeah, energy prices, exactly that’s what we want the American public to be aware is a possibility.”

Biden slapped Russia with new “swift and severe” sanctions less than 24 hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin declared two separatist regions in Ukraine’s eastern flank independent republics and Russian troops started deploying to occupy the zones under the auspices of “peacekeeping.”

Psaki failed to explain how the Biden administration would help cushion Americans from likely gas-price increases stemming from what it is calling a “first tranche” of sanctions. She promised that more financial weapons, such as export controls, can be unleashed if Putin proceeds with provocation and military escalation further past Ukraine’s borders.

Another reporter asked, “When can we expect a more detailed explanation from the White House about how it would plan to bring down energy prices?”

“A lot of what’s happening right now is sensitive. It includes a lot of conversations with foreign counterparts and other major large global suppliers. It also includes conversations we’re continuing to have with Congress and others about what steps may be at our disposal and the president is continuing to consider options,” Psaki responded.

“Why should Americans feel that that is a cost they should have to bear and that should affect their lives and how much should they be prepared for this geopolitical crisis to impact their day to day lives?” another reporter asked.

Psaki reiterated that penalizing Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity is about standing up for our “values” and “principles” as a nation while acknowledging that it will not be painless for Americans. She said Biden is in consultation with his national-security team to “leave no stone unturned” and “tap into the resources of global suppliers” to “reduce the impact on the American people.”

Potentially to minimize the burden, Psaki said the Biden administration is talking to natural-gas producers to understand their capacity and see if they’re able to surge their production to meet impending shortages.

With Russia being the third-largest producer of oil in the world and the second-largest producer of dry natural gas, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the sanctions are projected to trigger serious oil-supply disruptions, sending energy prices higher globally.

Americans are already saddled with mounting domestic inflation, having witnessed the highest prices at the pump since at least 2013 with a barrel of oil approaching $100 for the first time in seven years, Barrons noted. Brent crude oil hit an intraday high of $99.50 a barrel on Tuesday.

The Ukraine crisis has exposed how the western world is handicapped by its dependence on Russian energy — especially Europe, which gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","Following President Biden's announcement of new sanctions against Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Tuesday that there might be further increases in energy prices, which are already at a high level.

During a press briefing, reporters questioned Psaki about the potential financial impact on American citizens from the sanctions. These sanctions are directed at certain Russian individuals and entities and designed to restrict Russia's access to Western financial markets. Additionally, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was intended to transport natural gas from Russia to European countries, has been halted by Germany as a measure in response to the situation.

One reporter inquired if this meant higher gasoline prices could be expected, to which Psaki affirmed that rising energy costs are a possibility that the public should be aware of.

The sanctions imposed by Biden came shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized two separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and began the deployment of Russian troops to those areas. Psaki did not provide detailed information on measures the administration might take to mitigate potential increases in gas prices for Americans but mentioned that more economic actions, including export controls, could be considered should the situation escalate further.

Another reporter probed when a detailed strategy on addressing energy prices might be expected. Psaki indicated that sensitive discussions with international partners and global suppliers are underway and that options are being explored in coordination with Congress and other entities to evaluate potential actions.

When asked about the costs Americans would bear and the extent to which the geopolitical crisis could influence their lives, Psaki stated that taking actions against Russia's moves in Ukraine is about upholding certain standards and responding to the violation of international norms, even though it might entail challenges for the American public. She noted that President Biden and his national security team are actively exploring all avenues, including engaging with global natural gas producers to determine their production capabilities in light of potential shortages.

These economic measures have important implications since Russia is a major global oil producer and a significant source of natural gas. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's data for 2020, the concerned actions taken could lead to substantial disruptions in oil supplies, affecting energy prices worldwide.

The issue is further compounded by the fact that American consumers are dealing with heightened domestic inflation, which has led to the highest fuel prices since at least 2013. The price of Brent crude oil reached an intraday high of $99.50 per barrel on Tuesday.

The situation highlights the reliance of Western countries, particularly Europe, on Russian energy sources, which accounts for a significant portion of their natural gas and oil imports.","1. ""punitive sanctions package against Russia""
   - This phrase, ""punitive sanctions,"" suggests a bias towards a viewpoint that is in favor of strong and potentially aggressive international policies. In the context of political ideology, this implies support for a tough stance on foreign affairs and could signal a more hawkish or interventionist approach typically associated with conservative or neo-conservative ideologies.

2. ""creeping incursion into Ukraine""
   - The use of the word ""creeping"" implies a slow, insidious action by Russia in Ukraine, indicating disapproval of Russia's actions. This language suggests a bias against Russian policy and actions in Ukraine, siding with the Ukrainian perspective, which can be a hallmark of Western liberal democratic ideals that oppose territorial infringement.

3. ""sky-high energy prices to climb further""
   - Describing energy prices as ""sky-high,"" with the expectation of further increases, uses language that can stir anxiety and discontent among readers. This choice of words may reflect an ideology critical of the current administration’s energy policies, implying that their approach towards international affairs has a direct negative impact on domestic issues, which can be a talking point in conservative or right-leaning rhetoric criticizing government intervention or regulation.

4. ""swift and severe"" sanctions
   - Labeling sanctions as ""swift and severe"" demonstrates approval for decisive and harsh measures, which can suggest an ideological perspective that endorses strong leadership and immediate action, akin to conservative principles that value strong national defense and assertive foreign policy.

5. ""penalizing Russia for violating Ukraine's territorial integrity""
   - This phrase emphasizes the defense of territorial sovereignty, a concept that is often aligned with international law and the principles of national self-determination supported by liberal democracies. It underscores an ideology that opposes aggression and supports international norms and values.

6. ""standing up for our 'values' and 'principles' as a nation""
   - Mentioning ""values"" and ""principles"" suggests an appeal to moral high ground and ethical foreign policy. This choice of language hints at an ideology that values democratic norms, human rights, and rule-based international order typically associated with liberal internationalism.

7. ""global suppliers to 'reduce the impact on the American people.'""
   - The focus on reducing the impact of sanctions on Americans points to concern for domestic well-being and could indicate a political ideology that prioritizes American interests and the economic stability of its citizens, a standpoint that might align with both protectionist sentiments and liberal concerns for the impact of foreign policy on the domestic front.

8. ""handicapped by its dependence on Russian energy""
   - Using the term ""handicapped"" to describe reliance on Russian energy signals a viewpoint critical of energy dependency that restricts foreign policy options. This could be seen as promoting energy independence as a strategic priority, a principle often advocated by a range of ideologies from conservative to liberal, each emphasizing different methods such as increasing domestic energy production or investing in renewable energy sources.

9. ""mounting domestic inflation""
   - Discussing ""domestic inflation"" as a significant concern aligns with an ideology that stresses economic stability and could be construed as criticism of the current administration, which might be more prevalent in conservative discourse emphasizing fiscal responsibility.

Overall, the language and rhetoric of the article suggest an ideological bias that leans towards a viewpoint supporting strong international measures, the protection of national interests and values, and a critical stance on the domestic implications of foreign policy, aligning with aspects of both conservative and liberal ideologies depending on the context."
nationalreview,Climate Change,"A coalition of prosecutors in Los Angeles overwhelmingly support a recall of progressive District Attorney George Gascón, who has come under fire recently for rolling back enforcement of laws against a number of offenses, including resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and making criminal threats.

The vast majority of members of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles, at 97.9 percent, voted to back a recall of Gascón. They’ve repeatedly objected to his policies, which they say have incentivized more crime by watering down the penal code.

“This vote is by those who are intimately familiar with how Mr. Gascón’s policies actually play out on a day-to-day basis,” ADDA president Michele Hanisee told Politico. “We believe the vote of our members will resonate with the voters of Los Angeles as they decide whether to recall Gascón from office and restore public safety as the priority of the District Attorney’s office.”

Another organization representing LA prosecutors confirmed there is a lot of momentum behind the movement to remove Gascón. The Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys (LAADDA) said over nine of ten prosecutors in the city want him recalled.

“It’s been one year of Gascon’s social experiment,” Eric Siddall, vice president of LAADDA, told Fox News. “I think after that one year, people have had time to evaluate whether this is working or not working. I think most people who actually live in Los Angeles [and] understand what’s going on in Los Angeles, including the political leadership here in LA, feel that this has been a miserable failure.”

The LAADDA has filed two lawsuits against Gascon claiming that some of his orders infringed on state law.

“One of the first things he did was create a set of directives — in other words, internal rules that DAs were supposed to follow. Some of those rules directly contradicted California state law,” Siddall added. “One was that we couldn’t file strikes pursuant to the three-strikes law. And the three-strikes law is a mandatory law. It’s something that the prosecutors don’t have the discretion to ignore.”

The LA County registrar approved the recall, after a similar one failed to garner enough signatures last year. To trigger an election, the recall campaign must collect between 800,000 and 900,000 petition signatures.

After pledging to stop prosecuting juveniles as adults or pursuing sentences of life in prison without parole, Gascón backtracked to say he would review the specific circumstances of each case before making a judgment. He also admitted Monday that he improperly handled the case of a 26-year-old transgender woman who was sentenced to just two years in a juvenile facility for sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl at the age of 17. After his move provoked outrage, Gascón promised to try the woman as an adult rather than a child.

“While for most people several years of jail time is adequate, it may not be for Ms. Tubbs,” the progressive DA said in a statement. “If we knew about her disregard for the harm she caused we would have handled this case differently. The complex issues and facts of her particular case were unusual, and I should have treated them that way.”

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","A coalition of prosecutors in Los Angeles has expressed support for a recall of District Attorney George Gascón, who has been criticized for his approach to enforcement of laws against various offenses, such as resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and making criminal threats.

An overwhelming majority of the members of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles have voted in favor of supporting a recall of Gascón. They have voiced concerns about his policies, claiming that they could possibly lead to an increase in crime by altering the enforcement of the penal code.

“The vote reflects the insights of those who work closely with the day-to-day applications of Mr. Gascón’s policies,” said ADDA president Michele Hanisee. “We believe the vote of our members will be taken into consideration by the residents of Los Angeles as they evaluate their decision on whether to recall Gascón from office.”

In a similar vein, the Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys has reported significant backing for the movement to recall Gascón, with a high percentage of city prosecutors in support of the recall.

A year into the implementation of new district attorney policies, Eric Siddall, vice president of LAADDA, commented, ""I think after that one year, people have had time to assess the effectiveness of these policies. Many individuals, including political leaders in Los Angeles, have found the results to be disappointing.”

The LAADDA has initiated legal challenges against Gascón, alleging that some of his directives conflict with state law.

“One of his initial actions was to enact directives — essentially, internal guidelines for DAs. Some of these guidelines are in direct conflict with California state law,” said Siddall. “For example, directives that prevent the filing of enhancements under the three-strikes law. This law is not discretionary for prosecutors.”

The LA County registrar has approved the recall, following a previous attempt that did not gather sufficient signatures. To instigate a recall election, proponents need to collect a substantial number of petition signatures.

Gascón, after pledging changes in the prosecution of juveniles and life without parole sentences, has clarified that he will consider the specific details of each situation before determining the appropriate course of action. In one breach, involving the sentencing of a 26-year-old person for an offense committed at 17, Gascón acknowledged the need for a different approach and pledged to review the case.

“In certain instances, several years of incarceration is sufficient, but it may not be in every case,” Gascón stated. “Upon reviewing the full implications and the unique context of this specific case, we've recognized the need to handle it accordingly.”","1. ""progressive District Attorney George Gascón""
   - The label ""progressive"" establishes Gascón's political alignment with reformative or left-leaning politics associated with reducing harsh penalties in the criminal justice system.

2. ""rolling back enforcement of laws against a number of offenses, including resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and making criminal threats""
   - Phrasing like ""rolling back enforcement"" suggests a lax approach to crime that some would associate with undermining law and order, a point of view typically held by more conservative ideologies.

3. ""They've repeatedly objected to his policies, which they say have incentivized more crime by watering down the penal code.""
   - The phrase ""watering down the penal code"" implies the DA's reforms are weakening the criminal justice system, a conservative critique of progressive criminal justice reform.

4. ""restore public safety as the priority of the District Attorney’s office""
   - Emphasizing ""public safety"" reflects a law-and-order orientation, critiquing the DA from a standpoint that may imply his policies endanger public safety, aligning with more conservative or tough-on-crime ideologies.

5. ""social experiment""
   - Referring to Gascón's policies as a ""social experiment"" implies they are untested and risky, suggesting a critical and possibly conservative perspective on criminal justice reform.

6. ""miserable failure""
   - The harsh critique ""miserable failure"" indicates dissatisfaction with Gascón's policies and suggests that the outcomes are unacceptable, in line with conservative viewpoints that favor traditional law enforcement methods.

7. ""trigger an election""
   - This term is neutral on its own, but in the context of a recall effort, it indicates a democratic process for addressing dissatisfaction with elected officials. The use of ""trigger"" here is simply process-oriented and not ideologically indicative.

8. ""file strikes pursuant to the three-strikes law""
   - The discussion about the three-strikes law, which is typically defended by conservative ideologies for its tough stance on repeat offenders, suggests that the prosecutors hold a viewpoint that is against Gascón's more lenient approach.

9. ""improperly handled the case""
   - The term ""improperly handled"" suggests Gascón made mistakes in judgment, which aligns with the article's overall critical perspective on his policies. It indicates that his approach does not align with traditional prosecutorial standards, which some readers might associate with a need for strict adherence to existing law.

10. ""he improperly handled the case of a 26-year-old transgender woman who was sentenced to just two years in a juvenile facility for sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl""
    - The specific mention of the individual's identity as a ""transgender woman"" alongside a brief sentence for a serious crime plays into controversial and often politicized discussions on gender, justice, and punishment, potentially resonating with readers who are critical of progressive approaches to law enforcement.

These examples taken together suggest that the article is written from a perspective critical of progressive criminal justice policies and sympathetic to conservative or traditional law enforcement viewpoints. It uses language that implies Gascón's policies are dangerous, ineffective, and out of step with the rule of law."
nationalreview,Economy,"More Americans believe inflation is the nation’s most important problem now than at any point since 1985, according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday.

Seventeen percent of Americans said rising prices are the country’s most important problem, the survey found. The figure is up from 10 percent in February and 8 percent in January.

In 1985, 18 percent of Americans said inflation was the nation’s most important issue, according to Gallup.

The renewed concern comes as inflation has hit its highest point in 40 years and gas prices have skyrocketed since Russia invaded Ukraine. Four percent of Americans cited fuel prices specifically as the greatest problem in March.

Consumer prices rose 7.9 percent in February from the year prior, the Labor Department announced this month. The increase was the largest since January 1982, which saw an 8.6 percent jump.

Meanwhile, 59 percent of respondents said they worry about cost-of-living expenses a “great deal,” the poll found.

Inflation first began rising as a public concern last fall, according to Gallup. While rising prices registered no more than 2 percent of mentions in 2021, that number jumped in October when 5 percent of Americans cited inflation as the most pressing issue.

A majority of families earning $40,000 or more (63 percent) said they are very concerned about rising costs, while 58 percent of those earning $100,000 or more said the same.

Republicans were much more concerned about inflation, with 79 percent of Republicans expressing serious concern about rising cost-of-living, while just 35 percent of Democrats said the same.

“Inflation doesn’t dominate Americans’ perceptions of the most important problem facing the country today the way it did in the early 1980s, but it’s more top-of-mind than it’s been in over three decades and appears to be taking a toll on Americans’ broader economic confidence,” Gallup said in a news release.

Sixty-eight percent of respondents cited one of several noneconomic issues as the country’s most pressing problem, including 22 percent of Americans who believe the government and poor leadership are the most important problem. Nine percent said the war in Ukraine is the most important problem.

The poll was conducted March 1-18 among 1,017 adults and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","A recent Gallup poll shows that inflation is now considered by a segment of Americans to be the primary issue facing the nation, a level of concern that has not been recorded since 1985.

The poll revealed that 17% of those surveyed in March regard inflation and rising prices as the country's most pressing challenge. This is an increase from 10% in February and 8% in January. The last time inflation was seen as a similarly critical issue was in 1985, when 18% of Americans held this view.

Current inflation rates have reached heights not seen in four decades, with consumer prices escalating by 7.9% in February compared to the previous year, as announced by the Labor Department. In addition, 4% of respondents in March pointed to fuel prices as the leading issue, which have risen noticeably in recent months.

Concern over the cost of living has been growing in the U.S. Fifty-nine percent of those polled expressed considerable anxiety about such expenses.

The scrutiny on inflation started to increase last fall. Before then, inflation barely registered as a concern in national polls, with only 2% of mentions throughout the year. This shifted in October when the percentage began to rise.

The concern over rising costs is shared across income levels, with 63% of households earning $40,000 or more and 58% of those with incomes of $100,000 or more indicating they are very worried about this trend.

Different political party supporters show varying levels of concern toward inflation, with 79% of one party expressing grave worries about the rising cost of living compared to 35% from another party.

Although economic issues, including inflation, are on many people’s minds, a majority of respondents, 68%, believe that other non-economic matters constitute the most pressing national issues. Of these, 22% think government and leadership are at the top of the list, and 9% are most concerned with the ongoing war situation in Ukraine.

The survey, which was conducted from March 1 to March 18, included 1,017 adults and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.","This article appears to maintain a neutral tone and focuses on presenting the data from the Gallup poll without overtly editorializing. However, there may be subtle choices in language and framing that could indicate a particular viewpoint or bias. Here are some instances with descriptions and explanations of potential underlying political ideologies:

1. ""More Americans believe inflation is the nation’s most important problem now than at any point since 1985"" - The focus on the historical comparison to 1985 emphasizes the severity of the current inflation situation. This framing could resonate with politically conservative audiences who often prioritize economic stability and may be critical of current economic policies.

2. ""Inflation has hit its highest point in 40 years"" - The emphasis on the 40-year record could be seen as a critique of the current administration's economic management, a viewpoint often associated with conservative perspectives.

3. ""Gas prices have skyrocketed since Russia invaded Ukraine"" - Highlighting the connection between international conflict and domestic gas prices could imply a critique of foreign policy and energy dependence, which are sometimes voiced in conservative dialogue.

4. ""Seventeen percent of Americans said rising prices are the country’s most important problem"" - This might suggest the author believes that inflation should be a priority, a stance that is more typically aligned with conservative economic concerns.

5. ""Republicans were much more concerned about inflation, with 79 percent expressing serious concern"" - By contrasting the levels of concern between Republicans and Democrats, the text might be indirectly suggesting there's a partisan divide on the significance of inflation, a point that could align with conservative narratives.

6. ""Sixty-eight percent of respondents cited one of several noneconomic issues as the country’s most pressing problem"" - This statement leads with the majority viewpoint, which might indicate a more liberal-leaning bias by emphasizing that while inflation is a concern, most see noneconomic issues as more pressing.

While these points may touch on the angles from which different political ideologies might view the article, it should be noted that the article overall does not strongly advocate for a particular ideology. The information is presented factually with some contextual framing that provides insight into the significance of the data rather than promoting a singular political perspective. Each point above only offers a slight suggestion of bias or viewpoint, and they are not overt in promoting a political stance."
nationalreview,Economy,"The consumer price index went up by 7.5 percent over the last year, the highest annual increase since February 1982.

Inflation increased at the fastest rate in 40 years over the last twelve months, outpacing projections, the U.S. Department of Labor announced Thursday.

The consumer price index (CPI) — a major measure of inflation covering a variety of consumer goods — surged 0.6 percent over the last month and 7.5 percent over the last twelve months ending in January. That represents the largest annual spike since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.62 percent.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also went up by 0.6 percent in January, following another 0.6 percent increase in December. This marks the seventh time in the ten months that it has increased at least 0.5 percent. The Core CPI increased by 6.0 percent annually, the steepest 12-month jump since

 the period ending August 1982.

Food, electricity, and shelter contributed the most to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. Energy prices picked up 0.9 percent for the month, with rising electricity costs being somewhat offset by declines in gasoline and natural gas costs.

The persistent inflation, exacerbated by a supply chain crisis marked by production bottlenecks and shipping delays, has prompted the Federal Reserve to switch strategy. Starting in March, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated, the central bank could start to reverse its accommodative monetary policy and hike interest rates to curb spiraling inflation. The Fed is also likely to start unloading its gigantic balance sheet and roll back the pace of its large scale asset purchases that have been injecting stimulus into the economy for years.

While pressure is piling on the Fed to slow inflationary pressures strangling many Americans at the gas pump, grocery store, and across goods and services, the stock market is expected to react poorly in the event of an interest rate increase. After Powell’s announcement of quantitative tightening, major stock indices the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite dipped 1 percent, 0.9 percent, and 0.7 percent, respectively. The tradeoff for combating inflation is often a drag in economic production, although while restoring purchasing power to consumers.

For months, the Fed maintained its monetary easing despite mounting inflation, projecting that the price hikes would temper as market imbalances rectified. However, that prediction proved wrong, as supply and demand mismatches continued and inflation has climbed each consecutive month since early 2020. Powell suggested recently that if the Fed doesn’t intervene, inflation could intensify.

“Inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants, and certainly in my view as well. There’s a risk that the high inflation we are seeing will be prolonged. There’s a risk that it will move even higher. So, we don’t think that’s the base case, but, you asked what the risks are, and we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes,” he said recently.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","The consumer price index increased by 7.5 percent over the past year, marking the most significant annual rise since February 1982 according to the latest data.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the rate of inflation over the last twelve months exceeded expectations, highlighting a rapid increase not seen in 40 years. The consumer price index, a broad measure of inflation covering an array of consumer goods, rose by 0.6 percent in the past month, cumulating in a 7.5 percent increase over the year ending in January. This change is the most substantial since February 1982 when the inflation rate reached 7.62 percent.

Additionally, the core CPI, which strips out the often-volatile costs of food and energy, also experienced an increase of 0.6 percent in January, consistent with the rise seen in December. Over the past ten months, there have been seven instances where the core CPI jumped by at least 0.5 percent. The annual increase for the core CPI reached 6.0 percent, which is the highest rate observed since August 1982.

The most significant contributions to the seasonally adjusted rise came from the costs of food, electricity, and housing. Energy prices saw a slight increase of 0.9 percent in the month, as increased electricity costs were partially offset by decreases in gasoline and natural gas prices.

The ongoing inflation, influenced by supply chain issues characterized by production slowdowns and shipping delays, has led the Federal Reserve to consider changes in its policy approach. Starting in March, the central bank intends to adjust its monetary policy by potentially increasing interest rates with the goal of managing the rising inflation rates. Furthermore, the Fed is preparing to gradually reduce its large balance sheet and taper the pace of its asset-purchase program which has been part of the economic stimulus measures.

As the Federal Reserve focuses on reducing inflation, which affects many individuals through higher costs at the gas pump and grocery store, it is anticipated that the stock market might reflect sensitivity to the potential interest rate hikes. Following the news of the Fed's plans for quantitative tightening, there was a slight downturn in major stock indices, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite experiencing declines of 1 percent, 0.9 percent, and 0.7 percent, respectively. Balancing inflation with economic growth remains a central concern, as policies aimed at decreasing inflation also influence overall economic activity and ultimately consumer purchasing power.

Previously, the Fed continued with its stimulus measures expecting that inflation pressures would subside as market conditions improved. However, those expectations did not materialize as supply and demand imbalances have persisted and inflation rates have continued to ascend month-over-month since early 2020. The Federal Reserve has acknowledged the possibility that without intervention, inflationary trends may accelerate further.

During a recent address, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted concerns over ongoing high inflation and the possibility of it rising further, noting the importance of the central bank's preparedness to address multiple possible economic outcomes with its policy decisions.","The language and rhetoric in the provided article appear to be mostly factual and neutral, focusing on reporting the economic situation without overt ideological bias. However, there are subtle cues that can provide insights into the underlying political or economic ideology. Here are a few observations:

1. ""Inflation increased at the fastest rate in 40 years over the last twelve months, outpacing projections""
   - This emphasizes the unexpected and significant nature of the inflation rise, which could imply a criticism of economic forecasts, policymakers, or the current economic strategy. Such an emphasis might be consistent with a view that seeks greater accountability and perhaps a more conservative approach to economic management.

2. ""The persistent inflation, exacerbated by a supply chain crisis marked by production bottlenecks and shipping delays""
   - The use of the word ""persistent"" and the phrase ""exacerbated by a supply chain crisis"" suggests a situation that has been ongoing and worsening, possibly implying that measures so far have been insufficient. This might align with ideologies that advocate for more aggressive intervention or different strategies to tackle economic problems.

3. ""The Federal Reserve to switch strategy""
   - Mentioning the need for the Federal Reserve to ""switch strategy"" implies a pivot or correction in approach, which could hint at a belief that previous strategies were suboptimal or flawed. This language might resonate with ideologies that support active monetary policy adjustments in response to economic conditions.

4. ""While pressure is piling on the Fed to slow inflationary pressures strangling many Americans at the gas pump, grocery store, and across goods and services""
   - The use of emotive language such as ""pressure is piling on"" and ""strangling"" indicates the severity of the situation and its impact on everyday citizens. This could appeal to ideologies that prioritize immediate relief for the population or that criticize the handling of the economy for its effects on the average person.

5. ""the stock market is expected to react poorly in the event of an interest rate increase""
   - Highlighting the negative impact of inflation control measures on the stock market could suggest a viewpoint that is concerned with market performance, potentially aligning with pro-business or capitalist ideologies that prioritize market stability and investor concerns.

6. ""The tradeoff for combating inflation is often a drag in economic production, although while restoring purchasing power to consumers.""
   - The acknowledgement of ""tradeoff"" reflects an understanding of complex economic decisions and could be interpreted as endorsing a balanced view that recognizes both the downsides and the benefits of policy actions, a perspective that might appeal to pragmatists or moderates.

Overall, while certain phrases may hint at concerns over economic management, calls for intervention, and the impacts on the average consumer, there doesn’t seem to be an explicit and strong ideological leaning in the article towards either end of the political spectrum. Instead, it maintains a relatively neutral tone while reporting on economic trends and policy responses."
nationalreview,Election,"Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) tore into President Biden’s speech advocating a suspension of filibuster rules, in remarks on the Senate floor on Wednesday.

“The president’s rant — rant — yesterday was incoherent, incorrect, and beneath his office,” McConnell said.

Biden gave a speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Tuesday in an attempt to drum up support for suspending filibuster rules in order to pass voting legislation. McConnell blasted the speech as a demagogic attempt to cast Republicans as racists over their opposition to federalizing elections.

“The president repeatedly invoked the January 6th riot while himself using irresponsible, delegitimizing rhetoric that undermines our democracy,” McConnell continued. “The sitting president of the United States compared American states to totalitarian states. . . . So the world saw our commander-in-chief propagandize against his own country to a degree that would have made Pravda blush.”

McConnell decried Biden’s rhetoric as painting millions of voters and a majority of the Senate as “racist.”

“A president shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants is proving exactly why the Framers built the Senate to check his power,” McConnell said. “This whole display is the best possible argument for preserving the Senate rules that extend deliberation, force bipartisan compromise, and let cooler heads prevail.”

Biden compared opponents of Democrats’ voting legislation to southern segregationists in his Tuesday speech, asking, “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?”

One of the bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would restore portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required districts with a history of discrimination to obtain approval from the Justice Department before changing voting rules.

A second bill, the Freedom to Vote Act, would set a 15-day minimum early voting period, set national voter-ID standards that would include a range of documentation, make it easier for residents to sue states over redistricting issues, and make Election Day a federal holiday.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) responded to President Biden’s recent speech on the subject of filibuster rules with strong criticism during his time on the Senate floor Wednesday.

McConnell questioned the coherence and accuracy of Biden’s statements, expressing his belief that the speech was not reflective of the presidential office.

Biden's speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Tuesday was part of an effort to seek support for changes to the Senate filibuster rules to facilitate the passage of voting rights legislation. McConnell criticized this by saying that it mischaracterized Republicans' stance on federal oversight of elections.

McConnell cited concerns regarding Biden's rhetoric and compared his comments on certain American states to those made about totalitarian regimes.

In his remarks, McConnell challenged the implication that those disagreeing with the proposed changes, including a significant portion of the Senate and many American voters, were opposed due to racial bias.

Pointing to the nation's history, McConnell suggested that the current Senate rules, which require extended discussion and often bipartisan cooperation, are an essential part of the legislative process to prevent hasty decisions.

In his speech, Biden raised the question of historical alignment, referencing civil rights figures to underline the significant implications of voting legislation.

The John Lewis Voting Rights Act, one of the pieces of legislation under consideration, aims to reinstate sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which required jurisdictions with known discriminatory practices to seek approval before altering voting regulations.

Additionally, the Freedom to Vote Act proposes a minimum of 15 days for early voting, the establishment of national voter ID standards with a variety of acceptable documents, the simplification of the process for residents to challenge state redistricting in court, and the designation of Election Day as a federal holiday.

For additional information, the news team at NR invites tips from the public.","This article demonstrates a conservative political perspective, particularly aligning with Republican party ideologies. Below are specific instances that suggest this particular bias:

1. Quote: ""Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) tore into President Biden’s speech...""
   Explanation: The use of the verb ""tore into"" suggests an aggressive critique, which frames McConnell's response as a strong, valiant opposition—common in conservative or Republican messaging.

2. Quote: ""The president’s rant — rant — yesterday was incoherent, incorrect, and beneath his office.""
   Explanation: Referring to President Biden’s speech as a ""rant"" twice emphatically suggests a dismissive attitude towards the speech, implying a lack of coherence or dignity, which is a criticism often leveled by conservatives against Democratic politicians.

3. Quote: ""...a demagogic attempt to cast Republicans as racists over their opposition to federalizing elections.""
   Explanation: The term ""demagogic"" is a negative descriptor that suggests manipulation or appealing to emotions rather than reason. It aligns with conservative views that accuse Democrats of using identity politics.

4. Quote: ""...irresponsible, delegitimizing rhetoric that undermines our democracy.""
   Explanation: McConnell is framed as a defender of democracy, a common conservative positioning, suggesting that President Biden, by contrast, is behaving irresponsibly.

5. Quote: ""...would have made Pravda blush.""
   Explanation: Referencing Pravda, the former official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, serves to associate Biden with communist or totalitarian practices, a frequent rhetorical device used by the right to discredit leftist policies.

6. Quote: ""A president shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist...""
   Explanation: The choice of the word ""shouting"" portrays Biden as irrationally confrontational and positions Republicans as victims of unfounded accusations.

7. Quote: ""A president... is proving exactly why the Framers built the Senate to check his power.""
   Explanation: This evokes the conservative reverence for the Founding Fathers and the constitutional framework that checks executive power, framing McConnell and Senate Republicans as protectors of constitutional intent.

8. Quote: ""This whole display is the best possible argument for preserving the Senate rules...""
   Explanation: The author’s language supports the status quo of Senate rules, which is a frequent stance in conservative ideology, emphasizing deliberation and bipartisanship as opposed to what might be suggested as hasty or partisan rule changes by Democrats.

9. Quote: ""Biden compared opponents of Democrats’ voting legislation to southern segregationists...""
   Explanation: This description characterizes Biden’s comparison as an extreme accusation, implying it is part of a strategy by Democrats to vilify the opposition, which aligns with a conservative viewpoint critical of tactics used by the left to advance policy.

The consistent portrayal of conservative values, framing, and use of language serves to support the underlying ideology of the article, favoring a Republican or right-wing perspective."
nationalreview,Election,"Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton again on Thursday repudiated as a phony scandal the recent revelation that operatives connected to her campaign allegedly spied on the Trump administration as part of an effort to cook up a Russia-collusion narrative.

During her keynote speech for the 2022 New York State Democratic Convention, Clinton said Durham’s findings are a “right-wing lie” meant to serve as a distraction from Trump’s own scandals.

“And we can’t get distracted. Whether it’s by the latest culture war nonsense or some new right-wing lie on Fox or Facebook. By the way, they’ve been coming after me again in case you might have noticed. It’s funny, the more trouble Trump gets into the wilder the charges and conspiracy theories about me seem to get,” she said.

“So now his accountants have fired him and investigations draw closer to him and right on cue the noise machine gets turned up…” she added. “Fox leads the charge against me, counting on their audience to fall for it again. They’re getting awfully close to actual malice in their attacks.”

Special counsel John Durham is currently trying to get to the bottom of the extensive Trump/Russia probe launched by the Obama administration that spanned into the Trump administration, consuming the press and public for two years.

In a court filing last week, Durham claimed that a technology executive “exploited his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data” to extract contacts between Moscow and facilities tied to Trump. Those facilities included Trump Tower, Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and the executive office of the presidency, after Trump had already been inaugurated, according to the court filing.

Durham’s filing only identified the person as “Tech Executive-1,” the Washington Examiner reported. However, previous reporting by CNN indicated that that individual is Rodney Joffe, a senior vice president at Neustar who was also a client of Michael Sussmann, a partner at Perkins Coie, the high-powered law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party.

Durham had previously indicted Sussmann for lying to the FBI to obscure his association with the Clinton campaign. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.

Durham alleges that the unnamed tech executive delivered the data he collected to Sussmann, who then allegedly brought it to the FBI and the CIA alleging an improper connection between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Durham also noted that the unnamed technology executive worked with an investigative firm that Perkins Coie hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The executive abused his company’s “sensitive arrangement” to provide services to the executive office of the president “for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,” Durham reportedly alleged.

Since Durham’s bombshell dropped, Trump released statements accusing Clinton of orchestrating an “espionage campaign on his New York City apartment.”

“The latest pleading from Special Counsel Robert [sic] Durham provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia,” Trump said in an email statement.

“This is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate and those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution,” he added.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton addressed the claims regarding operatives connected to her campaign and their alleged surveillance activities during Donald Trump's administration in her keynote speech at the 2022 New York State Democratic Convention. Clinton dismissed the claims, suggesting that she is frequently targeted with such accusations, particularly when there is increased scrutiny on Trump's activities.

Special Counsel John Durham is investigating the origins and conduct of the Trump/Russia probe initiated during the Obama administration, which continued into Trump's term and was highly publicized. A recent court submission by Durham suggested that a technology executive utilized their access to unique internet data to monitor electronic communications associated with Trump, including those at Trump Tower and the executive office of the presidency.

The court documents only referred to this individual as ""Tech Executive-1."" It is reported, according to previous CNN coverage, that this executive is Rodney Joffe, a senior vice president at Neustar who was a client of Michael Sussmann, a lawyer at the firm Perkins Coie. Perkins Coie represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. Sussmann, who has entered a plea of not guilty, was charged by Durham with making a false statement to the FBI regarding his association with the Clinton campaign.

The allegations include that the technology executive relayed the gathered information to Sussmann, who then supposedly provided it to the FBI and CIA with claims of impropriety involving Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Durham also indicated that this executive was in collaboration with a research company hired by Perkins Coie on behalf of Clinton's campaign and is alleged to have overstepped in using this partnership to collect negative information on Donald Trump.

In response, Trump issued statements asserting that the evidence points to a contrived connection to Russia which was created by individuals paid by Clinton's campaign. Trump has expressed that this indicates a significant scandal, suggesting the seriousness of the situation in his view.

Those with additional information on this matter are invited to send details to the news team at NR.","1. ""Hillary Clinton again on Thursday repudiated as a phony scandal the recent revelation""
   - The phrase ""phony scandal"" suggests that Clinton and her political allies dismiss the allegations as false and unworthy of attention. The language implies that the scandal is fabricated or exaggerated, which aligns with a liberal or Democratic ideology that often characterizes Republican-driven investigations into Clinton as baseless or politically motivated.

2. ""During her keynote speech for the 2022 New York State Democratic Convention, Clinton said Durham’s findings are a 'right-wing lie' meant to serve as a distraction from Trump’s own scandals.""
   - Referring to the findings as a ""right-wing lie"" indicates a belief that conservative or right-wing groups are creating false narratives for political gain. This supports a left-leaning ideology that accuses the right of strategic deception and diversion from their own issues.

3. ""the latest culture war nonsense or some new right-wing lie on Fox or Facebook""
   - The characterization of controversies as ""culture war nonsense"" and referring to conservative media allegations as ""right-wing lie"" reflects a Democratic perspective that criticizes conservative media outlets like Fox News for promoting divisive or misleading narratives.

4. ""Fox leads the charge against me, counting on their audience to fall for it again. They’re getting awfully close to actual malice in their attacks.""
   - Accusing Fox News of acting with ""actual malice"" suggests that the outlet spreads deliberate misinformation with the intent to harm Clinton's reputation, which aligns with a viewpoint often held by progressives or partisan Democrats.

5. ""Durham had previously indicted Sussmann for lying to the FBI to obscure his association with the Clinton campaign.""
   - The reference to ""lying to the FBI"" indicates a belief in inappropriate conduct, but it stops short of assigning broader conspiracy or systemic corruption. This could be consistent with a politically neutral or balanced perspective that focuses on individual actions rather than larger partisan narratives.

6. ""Durham also noted that the unnamed technology executive worked with an investigative firm that Perkins Coie hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign.""
   - The way this is worded suggests an indirect link between the Clinton campaign and the actions of the ""unnamed technology executive,"" potentially softening the impact of the allegations made by Durham by not directly accusing the campaign of orchestrating the actions.

7. ""Trump released statements accusing Clinton of orchestrating an 'espionage campaign on his New York City apartment.'""
   - Reporting Trump's accusation of an ""espionage campaign"" against him carries a tone of seriousness and conspiracy, which appeals to conservative ideologies that believe in the existence of deep-seated corruption and conspiracy against Trump by Democratic opponents.

8. ""This is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate""
   - The comparison to Watergate amplifies the severity of the allegations against the Clinton campaign, resonating with a right-wing viewpoint that seeks to elevate suspicions of Democratic misconduct to historic levels of scandal. 

The language throughout the article provides a balanced view of the ideological perspectives, presenting Clinton's and Trump's positions and their respective framing of the issue. Overall, the article includes language suggesting bias from both political viewpoints, although it mainly centers on the subjects' rhetoric rather than directly asserting bias from the author or publication."

A nine-time champion of the Australian Open, who abstained from receiving the shot, Djokovic is expected to be disqualified from competing to defend his 2021 title by the country’s authorities for improper entry paperwork.

The player “failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements for Australia and visa has been subsequently canceled,” Australia Health Minister Greg Hunt said in an on-camera interview with local press on Thursday.

After traveling to Melbourne to participate in the tournament, Djokovic is reportedly being held at the airport for presenting a visa that does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated, according to Australian news outlets.

The Australian Border Force raised the issue of the athlete’s visa with the state Victoria government and suspended his admission into the country, according to The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

“The Australian Border Force will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our laws and entry requirements,” a statement from the agency read. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.”

1. ""Australia has rejected the visa of Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic over an inadmissible medical vaccine exemption.""
   - This sentence presents the Australian government's action as firm and decisive, using the word ""rejected"" which indicates a tough stance on border and health security policies, consistent with a conservative or right-leaning ideology valuing strict immigration controls.

2. ""Djokovic is expected to be disqualified from competing to defend his 2021 title by the country’s authorities for improper entry paperwork.""

4. ""The Australian Border Force raised the issue of the athlete’s visa with the state Victoria government and suspended his admission into the country.""
   - The active role of the Australian Border Force in enforcing immigration laws demonstrates a focus on sovereignty and border integrity, which can be indicative of a nationalist perspective commonly found in right-leaning ideologies.

5. ""Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.""
   - The firm language used here (""detained and removed"") reflects a strict and possibly nationalist immigration stance, which aligns with conservative ideologies that often prioritize the protection of national borders and the enforcement of immigration laws.

nationalreview,Immigration,"President Biden compared the influx of Ukrainian refugees in Poland to the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border in comments during a meeting with Polish president Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Saturday.

Poland has absorbed over 2.2 million Ukrainian refugees since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine at the end of February. Biden called on other NATO allies to receive more refugees fleeing from the war.

“We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on a significant responsibility that I don’t think should just be Poland, it should be the whole world—all of NATO’s responsibility. The fact that you have so many Ukrainians seeking refuge in this country of Poland, we understand that because we have on our southern border thousands of people a day—literally, not figuratively—trying to get to the United States,” Biden said at a bilateral meeting with Duda.

Biden added that his administration believes it should “do our part relative to Ukraine as well by opening our borders to another 100,000 people,” apparently referencing a decision to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees under temporary protected status.

U.S. border agents encountered over 2 million migrants at the southern border during President Biden’s first year in office. The influx saw record-breaking monthly totals, with a high of 213,593 encounters recorded in July 2021.

The U.S. border crisis is ongoing with 164,973 migrant encounters reported in February, up over 60 percent from February 2021. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement report released in March showed that ICE arrests and deportations dropped after the president assumed office.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","President Biden, during a meeting with Polish president Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Saturday, discussed the challenge Poland is facing with the arrival of Ukrainian refugees as a result of the conflict involving Russia. Poland has welcomed over 2.2 million Ukrainian refugees since the hostilities began. In light of this, Biden emphasized the importance of support from NATO allies in addressing the refugee crisis.

Biden highlighted the parallels between Poland’s experience with refugees and the United States' situation, noting the daily arrival of individuals at the U.S.–Mexico border seeking entry into the United States. Acknowledging Poland's efforts, Biden expressed the U.S. administration's intent to accept 100,000 Ukrainian refugees under temporary protected status to share in the global humanitarian effort.

Data indicates that U.S. border agents encountered over 2 million migrants at the southern border during the past year. This surge in numbers set new records, with the highest count of 213,593 encounters happening in July 2021.

The migration issue at the U.S. southern border has remained at the forefront with 164,973 migrant encounters reported in February, showing an increase from the previous year. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement report in March highlighted a decrease in ICE arrests and deportations since the current administration took office.","The article you provided discusses President Biden's comments on the Ukrainian refugee situation and its comparison to the U.S.–Mexico border situation. Analyzing the language and rhetoric, we can identify certain ideological leanings or biases:

1. **Brief quote or description**: ""President Biden compared the influx of Ukrainian refugees in Poland to the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border...""
   - **Explanation**: The comparison made here is presented in a neutral manner, without any inherent bias indicated by this particular sentence. It is merely reporting on a statement by President Biden.

2. **Brief quote or description**: ""...Biden called on other NATO allies to receive more refugees fleeing from the war.""
   - **Explanation**: This sentence portrays a cooperative and humanitarian appeal to NATO allies, which can be seen as consistent with a more collective, internationalist approach typically associated with liberal political ideologies.

3. **Brief quote or description**: ""We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on a significant responsibility that I don’t think should just be Poland...""
   - **Explanation**: The phrase ""significant responsibility"" and the call for shared responsibility suggests sympathy for Poland's situation and a belief in collective action, which leans towards a more liberal or left-leaning internationalist perspective.

4. **Brief quote or description**: ""The fact that you have so many Ukrainians seeking refuge in this country of Poland, we understand that because we have on our southern border thousands of people a day...""
   - **Explanation**: By drawing a parallel between the Ukrainian refugees in Poland and the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border, there is an implicit comparison that could be seen as potentially downplaying the urgency or uniqueness of the Ukraine situation, or attempting to create a sense of relatable experience. This could suggest a bias towards emphasizing domestic challenges.

5. **Brief quote or description**: ""U.S. border agents encountered over 2 million migrants at the southern border during President Biden’s first year in office. The influx saw record-breaking monthly totals...""
   - **Explanation**: The use of terms like ""influx"" and ""record-breaking monthly totals"" could indicate a perceived negative connotation associated with the high number of migrants. This language might suggest a viewpoint that is more conservative or critical of the current administration's border policies.

6. **Brief quote or description**: ""A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement report released in March showed that ICE arrests and deportations dropped after the president assumed office.""
   - **Explanation**: Highlighting the drop in ICE arrests and deportations since President Biden took office may suggest criticism of a more lenient immigration approach. This could reflect a conservative bias that favors stricter immigration enforcement.

7. **Brief quote or description**: ""Send a tip to the news team at NR.""
   - **Explanation**: The abbreviation ""NR"" is typically associated with National Review, a publication known for its conservative viewpoints. The request for tips indicates an active engagement with the audience, which might imply a commitment to investigative journalism from a particular conservative angle.

Overall, despite a few neutral informative statements, the article uses language that on balance seems to emphasize the challenges of immigration in a manner that could appeal to readers with conservative viewpoints, while recognizing the humanitarian needs related to the refugee situation. The conservative bias appears to be more evident in the way the U.S.–Mexico border situation is described and in subtle cues about policy effectiveness."
nationalreview,Police,"One year into his presidency, it seems like Joe Biden and the Democrats in Washington, D.C. have sent the country back in time to the late-1970s and early 80s, “when runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map,” Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said Tuesday night, in the official Republican response to Biden’s State of the Union address.

Speaking in front of the Iowa state capitol in Des Moines, Reynolds attacked Biden’s international and domestic record, and she made the case for putting faith in the American people. Dressed in red and wearing an American and Ukrainian flag pin, she spoke about 15 minutes.

When he was elected, Biden promised to make America respected again on the world stage and unite the country. Instead, Reynolds said, “he’s failed on both fronts.”

Internationally, Reynolds said, the “disastrous” Afghanistan withdrawal betrayed American allies and embolden the country’s enemies. Biden did not address the Afghanistan withdrawal in his speech. And while Reynolds said Americans should stand united with the people of Ukraine who are fighting back against a Russian onslaught, she said Americans shouldn’t ignore Biden’s actions in the run-up to the invasion.

“Waiving sanctions on Russian pipelines,” she said. “Eliminating oil production here at home. Focusing on political correctness rather than military readiness. Reacting to world events instead of driving them.”

It is time for America to lead again on the world stage, Reynold said. “But we can’t project strength abroad if we’re weak at home.”

Reynolds accused Biden of ignoring Republican warnings that increased government spending would lead to inflation, and that the administration’s anti-energy policies would lead to soaring gas prices. She said inflation is not a “high-class problem,” but is instead an “everybody problem.”

Biden and Democratic leaders need to step outside the D.C. bubble, and talk to regular Americans about their concerns, and “what keeps them up at night.”

“I can tell you what’s not on that list,” she said. “They won’t tell you that spending trillions more and bankrupting their children is the answer to their problems. They won’t tell you that we should be paying people not to work. And they certainly won’t tell you that we should be giving billions in tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires in Democratic controlled states like California, New York, and New Jersey.”

Reynolds said Americans are tired of elites who tell others what they can and cannot say, what they can and cannot believe, and they’re tired of hypocritical politicians who tell their citizens to stay home during the Covid-19 pandemic, while they sneak off to Florida for “sun and fun.” Americans are tired of liberal prosecutors letting criminals off easy while crime soars, and they’re fed up with an administration that proposed vaccination requirements for people who want to work, but not for immigrants who cross the border illegally, Reynolds said.

“The American people are left to feel like they’re the enemy”, she said, and they “are waiting for the insanity to stop.”

Reynolds praised Republican governors and red state leaders who are “balancing budgets and cutting taxes,” and who she said listened to science when it came to not requiring masks for kids at schools. School shutdowns have led to learning loss, isolation, and anxiety among America’s kids, she said.

“That’s why Iowa was the first state in the nation to require that schools open their doors,” she said. “I was attacked by the left. I was attacked by the media. But it wasn’t a hard choice.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Reynold’s message “optimistic” and “a stark contrast to Biden’s broken promises and Democrats’ divisive agenda.”

“Republican officials like Kim Reynolds have a record of real solutions helping struggling American families, workers, and small businesses,” McDaniel said in a prepared statement.

Send a tip to the news team at NR.","One year into his presidency, Joe Biden and the Democrats in Washington D.C., have faced challenges reminiscent of past decades, including concerns over inflation and foreign policy tensions, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds remarked on Tuesday night in the official response to Biden’s State of the Union address.

Standing at the Iowa state capitol in Des Moines, Reynolds critiqued Biden’s policies at home and abroad, advocating for a renewed focus on the needs and strengths of American citizens. Dressed in red and sporting an American and Ukrainian flag pin, she spoke for about 15 minutes.

Biden had made commitments to renew America's global reputation and to foster unity within the nation. Reynolds indicated there are perceptions that progress on these issues has been lacking.

On an international level, Reynolds critiqued the withdrawal from Afghanistan, expressing concern for its impact on global relationships. She also emphasized that while support for Ukraine is vital, domestic actions prior to the conflict should not be overlooked.

Reynolds suggested that instead of imposing sanctions and maintaining domestic energy production, the administration's decisions have prioritized other aspects. She iterated the importance of strong leadership both domestically and abroad.

Citing inflation and energy policy, Reynolds expressed that these issues affect a broad swathe of the population, not just certain segments. Government spending, employment incentives, and tax policies were among the subjects Reynolds discussed, suggesting they're areas of concern for the average American.

Reynolds pointed out people's frustrations with figures in authority over speech and belief restrictions, policy inconsistencies during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the tensions between law enforcement and prosecutorial decisions.

She also shared criticism of the administration's immigration and public health policy juxtapositions, voicing that this leads to a sense of disconnect among American citizens.

Highlighting fiscal responsibility, Governors, and leaders of some states were commended for their measures to maintain balanced budgets and tax reductions. Additionally, responses to educational policies during the pandemic—such as school closures—were a point of discussion, with Reynolds noting actions taken in Iowa to keep schools operational.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel characterized the message as one that offers alternative insights and remedies to what she views as the unfulfilled commitments and divisive approaches currently observed.

McDaniel's statement emphasized the role of certain officials in addressing the needs of American families, workers, and small businesses.

nationalreview,Police,"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been sentenced to serve another nine years in prison after he was convicted on trumped up embezzlement and contempt of court on Tuesday.

“Navalny committed fraud — the theft of property by an organized group,” Judge Margarita Kotova announced the verdict, according to Agence France-Presse. The court also found him guilty of being disrespectful to the court.

The sentence extension was announced shortly after the verdict, according to the Moscow Times.

Navalny had been accused of stealing several million dollars worth of donations from his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The prosecution in the case last week demanded that Navalny’s sentence be extended to 13 years, that he be moved to a “strict regime” penal colony, and that he pay a fine of 1.2 million rubles, or about $11,500.

The anti-corruption activist had already been imprisoned for two-and-a-half years at a detention center for violating probation related to a previous conviction on sham embezzlement charges. Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia to face the charges after after spending a month in a German hospital, where he was being treated for nerve-agent poisoning.

The former mayoral and presidential candidate claimed his treatment was politically motivated and green-lighted by Putin’s regime. The Kremlin denied that it played a role. Protests erupted across Russia in the two weeks prior to his sentencing and also after it was handed down, which were squashed by Russian authorities.

Navalny looked defiant and calm on video camera Tuesday, flipping through documents as the verdict was read. Each time he has been convicted of criminal activity by Russia, he has doubled down. On March 15, he posted on Instagram, “If the prison term is the price of my human right to say things that need to be said … then they can ask for 113 years. I will not renounce my words or deeds.”

Navalny and his close associates were listed on the “extremist and terrorist” federal registry in Russia, according to the Russian Federal Service for Financial Monitoring. Russian courts banned his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) last year, calling it an “extremist” group.

The dissident’s likely prison extension comes amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has triggered anti-war demonstrations across Russia and police crackdowns. In the early days of the conflict, Russian police arrested thousands of protestors calling for peace. In January, Navalny criticized the Biden administration for failing to confront the Kremlin for its aggression, likening the U.S. to a ” frightened schoolboy ” who cowers to a bully. At that point, Russia had ramped up its provocation, stationing over 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine.

Navalny told Time’s Simon Shuster, “Time and again the West falls into Putin’s elementary traps. It just takes my breath away, watching how Putin pulls this on the American establishment again and again.”

President Biden has repeatedly condemned Russia’s treatment of Navalny, warning last June that his death would erode U.S.-Russia relations. But that relationship has greatly deteriorated anyway since Russia launched the assault on its neighbor.

The decision to extend his sentence came shortly after the verdict, as mentioned by the Moscow Times.

Navalny, who has been accused of embezzling millions of dollars in donations from his Anti-Corruption Foundation, faced a prosecution last week that sought a 13-year enhanced sentence, his transfer to a high-security penal colony, and the imposition of a 1.2 million rubles fine (approximately $11,500).

Prior to this, Navalny was serving a two-and-a-half-year term at a detention center related to a previous embezzlement charge. He had returned to Russia from Germany, where he was treated for nerve-agent poisoning, to respond to the allegations against him.

The former mayoral and presidential candidate has consistently stated that his judicial challenges are a result of political motivations. The Russian government has denied these allegations. The period leading up to, and after, his sentencing saw widespread protests throughout Russia, which were met with a reinforced police presence.

During the announcement of the verdict on Tuesday, Navalny appeared collected, reviewing documents on a video camera. He has remained firm in his stance following previous convictions. On March 15, he conveyed on social media that he stands by his actions and words regardless of the prison term he faces.

Navalny and associates associated with his movement have been designated on the “extremist and terrorist” list by the Russian Federal Service for Financial Monitoring. His Anti-Corruption Foundation was labeled as an “extremist” organization by Russian courts and subsequently banned.

His legal situation continues to develop during a time of heightened tensions due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has led to numerous demonstrations within Russia and responses from law enforcement. Navalny has also commented on the international dynamics surrounding the conflict, offering critiques on the global response to the situation. Arrests of anti-war protesters have occurred frequently since the escalation of military activities near Ukraine.

The U.S. President, along with other international figures, has expressed concern regarding Navalny’s treatment. The atmosphere of U.S.-Russia relations has changed considerably in light of the ongoing situation in Ukraine.","1. **""trumped up embezzlement and contempt of court""** - This phrase suggests that the charges against Navalny are not legitimate (""trumped up"") but fabricated. The choice of words indicates a viewpoint that is skeptical of the legitimacy of the Russian legal proceedings in this case, implying support for Navalny and criticism of the Russian judiciary.

2. **""the theft of property by an organized group""** - This quote is from the judge, which the article presents without challenge. However, by describing it without directly alleging its falsehood, the article implicitly questions its validity by placing it in the context of ""trumped-up"" charges, suggesting disagreement with the court's narrative.

3. **""said things that need to be said""** - This quote attributed to Navalny frames him as a truth-teller, someone who speaks out against corruption or injustice despite personal cost. It portrays him as a martyr for free speech and opposition, aligning with an ideology that values democratic principles and human rights.

4. **""extremist and terrorist""** - By mentioning that Navalny and his associates were listed on a federal registry as extremists and terrorists, the article hints at the Russian government's use of such labels for political opposition, thereby suggesting an authoritarian tactic to suppress dissent. The word choice questions the legitimacy of such labels.

5. **""Putin’s regime""** and **""Kremlin denied""** - The use of ""regime"" typically denotes a government that is authoritarian or dictatorial, suggesting disapproval. The immediate follow-up that the ""Kremlin denied"" implies a lack of trust in the official statements from the Russian government, implying a bias against the current Russian leadership.

6. **""squashed by Russian authorities""** - This expression conveys force and suppression, indicative of a viewpoint that sees the Russian government's actions as repressive.

7. **""sham embezzlement charges""** - The use of ""sham"" to describe previous charges against Navalny implies that the author believes these charges to be false and contrived. It's an indication of a belief in Navalny's innocence and a viewpoint critical of the Russian legal process.

8. **""Putin’s invasion of Ukraine""** - The term ""invasion"" carries negative connotations and signifies an unwarranted and aggressive action by Russia. This choice of words communicates a clear disapproval of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, aligning with Western opposition to Russian military intervention.

9. **""police crackdowns""** - The term ""crackdowns"" suggests harsh and possibly excessive measures by authorities to suppress dissent, painting the Russian police actions in a negative light.

10. **""frightened schoolboy**"" - This metaphor, attributed to Navalny's criticism of the U.S. response, implies weakness or timidity. It suggests a position that wishes for a stronger response against Russian aggression, likely aligning with a more hawkish foreign policy perspective.

11. **""Putin’s elementary traps""** - This phrase suggests that the West is being consistently outmaneuvered by simple tactics from Putin, critiquing Western responses as naive. This frames Putin as cunning and manipulative, a viewpoint often held by critics of current Russian foreign policy.

12. **""Send a tip to the news team at NR.""** - The mention of ""NR"" at the end signifies that the article is likely from ""National Review,"" a publication known for its conservative commentary, which might indicate the underlying conservative viewpoint of the article. This may not be expressly an element of bias within the article, but it does provide context regarding the possible ideological perspective of the publication."
newsmax,Abortion,"A court's ruling that Florida can keep its ban on abortions that take place past 15 weeks of pregnancy is a win not only for the right to life, but also ""for the sanctity of our Constitution,"" Rep. Kat Cammack said on Newsmax Wednesday.

""I am so lucky to live in a state where we have incredibly strong leadership out of our state officials, of course, Gov. Ron DeSantis at the helm, but it was actually our attorney general, Ashley Moody, who within minutes of the district circuit judge issuing that ruling [to lift the ban] that she filed an appeal, which has led to the will of the people here in Florida to be upheld,"" the Florida Republican told Newsmax's ""National Report.""

In Florida, the state promptly filed an appeal soon after Circuit Court Judge John Cooper finalized an expected order blocking enforcement of a 15-week ban that took effect on Friday, which automatically froze the injunction.

""Our entire system of government is predicated on this notion of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" Cammack said, noting that after the Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, states like Florida are ""leading the charge in protecting life, and I couldn't be more proud of that.""

The congresswoman, meanwhile, slammed companies such as Disney which have promised to cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions.

""It's interesting how they like to choose ala carte the human rights issues that they're going to uphold,"" she said. ""When it comes to all lives or unborn lives, they don't seem to [care]. It's really interesting that as these companies continue to push out this woke messaging to try to appease the limousine liberal base that is growing across the country.

""They're also really quiet when it comes to the fact that many of these companies do not offer maternity leave or paid maternity leave. ""

Cammack said Republicans are working on legislation to help make adoption more accessible and more affordable, as well as finding ways to support working mothers.

""That's what the pro-life movement is all about,"" she said. ""It's about empowering women and being part of the post-Roe generation means that we have a tremendous responsibility to stand up for our women.""

The congresswoman also on Wednesday slammed California's Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom for running advertising urging people in Florida to move to his state ""where we still believe in freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate, and the freedom to love.""

""He would have been better off taking all that cash that it cost him to do that and just lighting it on fire,"" she said. ""There's a saying in politics that you never punch down and so clearly what we're seeing here is a pathetic attempt by Gov. Newsom to take a swipe at our governor, who is now being known as America's governor, because he stands up for families and individuals and businesses.""

She added that ""60,000 Californians over the last three years now getting Florida driver's licenses because they're fleeing California because of oppression … if it wasn't so sad, it would be funny, but I mean, what do you expect when you have a guy who's related to Nancy Pelosi and has lower approval ratings than Joe Biden?""

Kat Cammack commented on the development, expressing her approval of the leadership in her home state, notably recognizing the swift actions of Attorney General Ashley Moody and Gov. Ron DeSantis in responding to legal challenges against the law.

The appeal in Florida was filed immediately following a Circuit Court Judge John Cooper's expected order that had initially halted enforcement of the 15-week abortion restriction.

Rep. Cammack referenced the principles of life and personal freedom that the government upholds and stated that, following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, states have been active in enacting their own regulations regarding abortion.

In her remarks, Cammack criticized companies that offer financial support for employees traveling for abortions, suggesting there is an inconsistency in the way they approach various human rights issues, particularly noting the lack of maternity support in some of these companies.

Cammack mentioned that legislative efforts are ongoing to improve the accessibility and affordability of adoption, in addition to providing support for working mothers, reinforcing what she deems important values.

Additionally, Rep. Cammack responded to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's advertisements inviting Floridians to move to California, criticizing the spending on the campaign and making note of the demographic shift of some Californians obtaining Florida driver's licenses.

Newsmax continues to report on these developments and is available on various platforms for those interested in following these stories.","1. ""a win not only for the right to life, but also 'for the sanctity of our Constitution,'""
   - The phrase ""right to life"" and ""sanctity of our Constitution"" indicate a conservative or pro-life ideological stance that values both unborn life and a strict interpretation of the Constitution.

2. ""we have incredibly strong leadership out of our state officials, of course, Gov. Ron DeSantis at the helm""
   - Praising Ron DeSantis as a ""strong"" leader reflects a Republican or right-leaning bias. The use of ""incredibly strong leadership"" suggests approval of the current administration's policies and actions.

3. ""the will of the people here in Florida to be upheld""
   - This phrase suggests that the ban on abortions reflects the desires of the majority in Florida, which indicates a belief in majority rule and could suggest a conservative interpretation of public opinion on this issue.

4. ""states like Florida are 'leading the charge in protecting life'""
   - ""Protecting life"" is a common phrase used within the pro-life movement. This choice of words indicates a belief system that prioritizes the protection of unborn life, aligning with conservative political ideology.

5. ""push out this woke messaging""
   - Using ""woke"" in a negative context implies a criticism of progressive or left-leaning ideologies, especially related to social justice issues. This is a term often used by conservatives to describe actions or positions they see as performative or excessively politically correct.

6. ""to appease the limousine liberal base""
   - ""Limousine liberal"" is a pejorative term used to describe wealthy individuals who advocate for liberal or progressive policies. The phrase suggests a critique of perceived hypocrisy or inauthenticity within the liberal political sphere.

7. ""pro-life movement is all about... empowering women""
   - Framing the pro-life movement as one that empowers women could reveal a strategic rhetorical shift to counter the argument that the pro-choice movement is the sole supporter of women's rights. This can suggest an ideological stance that values traditional or conservative viewpoints regarding abortion while attempting to incorporate language of empowerment.

8. ""He would have been better off... just lighting it on fire""
   - This is a derogatory comment aimed at Gov. Gavin Newsom's ad campaign appealing to Floridians. The dismissive tone indicates a political rivalry and aligns with conservative criticism of liberal politicians’ tactics and policies.

9. ""America's governor, because he stands up for families and individuals and businesses""
   - Labeling Gov. DeSantis as ""America's governor"" suggests a broader national appeal and approval of his policies beyond Florida, which can imply conservative or Republican support.

10. ""60,000 Californians over the last three years now getting Florida driver's licenses because they're fleeing California because of oppression""
    - The word ""oppression"" in this context is employed to frame the situation in California under Democratic leadership as negative and insupportable, which indicates an ideology that favors Republican-led governance.

11. ""a guy who's related to Nancy Pelosi and has lower approval ratings than Joe Biden""
    - The mention of Nancy Pelosi, a prominent Democratic leader, and the comparison to President Joe Biden's approval ratings is employed to discredit Gov. Newsom based on his associations and perceived lack of popularity, which is a common tactic in partisan rhetoric.

The article's language and rhetoric align with conservative political ideology and Republican viewpoints, particularly with regards to abortion, leadership, and governance."
newsmax,Abortion,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Wednesday on Newsmax accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of sounding the ""dog whistle"" that led to an armed man showing up in the early morning hours outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home.

""The left always gives a dog whistle of violence, and Chuck Schumer is on record on video, calling for violence, basically a dog whistle for them to come after Justices Kavanaugh and [Neil] Gorsuch,"" the Georgia Republican said on Newsmax's ""John Bachman Now."" ""He named them by name, and he said they won't even know what hit them. Was he talking about a bullet? Was he talking about a knife? What kind of attack?""

In March, Schumer, D-N.Y., was criticized after standing outside the Supreme Court, surrounded by abortion rights supporters, and commenting that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh ""have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,"" reports The Washington Post.

The comments came while the justices were deliberating a crucial Louisiana abortion case, and before the Roe v. Wade leak indicating that the court would overturn the landmark 1973 decision. Schumer has denied making a call for violence with his comments, with a spokesman saying he meant Republicans would pay a political price"" for an anti-abortion decision, but Greene on Newsmax disagreed.

""Clearly he was talking about something and some of their foot soldiers took their orders, and this man was found at Kavanaugh's house ready to kill him,"" Greene insisted.

She also said that there has been no effort to go after the person who leaked the Roe v. Wade draft decision, which has left the conservative-leaning justices' lives in danger. Further, protests have been allowed to be held at the justices' homes, and that should have been stopped, Greene commented.

""There should have been a bigger effort by the Department of Justice to stop these protests, and thankfully, this man was arrested before he did the unthinkable,"" said Greene. ""Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and others, we don't see an effort for them to protect anyone but themselves.""

Greene also lambasted Democrats for their decision to call victims and families from the Uvalde school shootings to Washington, D.C. to testify in the gun control legislation hearings on Capitol Hill, including one little girl who covered herself in blood to survive.

""It's shameful to pull these families, especially an 11-year-old girl who laid there in the blood of her classmates after they had been murdered, just trying to be quiet and protect her own life,"" she said. ""These families are in mourning. They should be left alone not used as political props and some sort of stunt to force and persuade other members of Congress to vote for gun control in America.

""We don't have a gun problem in America, we have a sin problem … our children are our future. And so we should do everything we can to keep them safe at school and never, ever allow anything to happen to them or any parent to have to fear what may happen.""

Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared on Newsmax Wednesday, expressing concern over comments made by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, in relation to an incident where an armed individual was discovered outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's residence.

According to Rep. Greene, Schumer's remarks raised concerns as he had previously mentioned Justices Kavanaugh and [Neil] Gorsuch by name, suggesting they would face consequences for their decisions. This statement by Schumer was made while the justices were considering a significant Louisiana abortion case. Schumer's office has clarified that his comments were in reference to a political consequence, not a call for violence.

Greene went on to discuss the importance of addressing both security for public figures and the impact of the leak of the draft decision related to Roe v. Wade. She emphasized the need for the Department of Justice to take actions to ensure the safety of the justices amid ongoing protests, expressing relief that the individual found near Kavanaugh's home was apprehended before any harm could occur.

In addition, Greene touched upon the use of personal testimonies in the debate over gun control legislation, expressing her view that the inclusion of individuals and families affected by tragedies such as the Uvalde school shootings should be approached with sensitivity, and emphasizing the importance of school safety and the broader issues at hand.

Newsmax continues to report on these events and other news, servicing a wide audience across cable and streaming platforms.","This article offers several examples of language and rhetoric indicative of a specific political ideology. Below, I have numbered and analyzed these instances:

1. ""The left always gives a dog whistle of violence...""
   - This statement from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene labels the entire political left as using coded language to incite violence, indicating a conservative or right-leaning viewpoint that often accuses progressives of ideological extremism and indirect incitement.

2. ""…calling for violence, basically a dog whistle for them to come after Justices Kavanaugh and [Neil] Gorsuch.""
   - By interpreting Senator Schumer's comments as a ""dog whistle"" for violence, Greene promotes an interpretation that aligns with conservative narratives that assert liberals are attacking conservative justices and undermining the judiciary's integrity.

3. ""…you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""
   - This quote is used within the article to highlight controversial rhetoric from Senator Schumer. It is presented in a context suggesting an aggressive tone and potential implications for violence, aligning with a conservative ideological perspective on accountability for language, particularly from Democratic leaders.

4. ""Clearly he was talking about something and some of their foot soldiers took their orders...""
   - The suggestion that Schumer's remarks could be interpreted as marching orders reflects a view that Democrat rhetoric directly influences actions against conservatives, reinforcing a narrative common in right-leaning circles about political violence being tied to leftist language.

5. ""There should have been a bigger effort by the Department of Justice to stop these protests...""
   - The criticism of the DOJ for not stopping protests at justices' homes indicates a belief in strict law and order, a stance often associated with conservative ideologies that prioritize authoritative action to maintain public order and protect institutions.

6. ""Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and others, we don't see an effort for them to protect anyone but themselves.""
   - This statement suggests a partisan perspective, framing Democrat leaders as self-serving and negligent in protecting those outside of their political circle, tapping into conservative-leaning skepticism towards Democratic leadership.

7. ""It's shameful to pull these families... not used as political props and some sort of stunt to force and persuade other members of Congress to vote for gun control in America.""
   - The choice of words like ""shameful"" and ""political props"" in the context of discussing gun control testimony from families affected by shootings reflects a conservative ideology that tends to resist such legislation and views such advocacy skeptically.

8. ""We don't have a gun problem in America, we have a sin problem...""
   - This is a rhetorical shift from policy to morality, typical of conservative discourse, suggesting that societal issues are not to be solved by regulation but by addressing moral decay.

9. ""…keep them safe at school and never, ever allow anything to happen to them or any parent to have to fear what may happen.""
   - Here, the emphasis on safety and parental fear taps into conservative themes of protecting children and family values, often used in discourse against gun control measures.

10. ""NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!""
    - The promotion of Newsmax, a media outlet known for its conservative slant, suggests an alignment with right-wing ideologies and serves as an endorsement of the ideological lean of the channel.

These examples, when considered together, point to the political ideology underlying this article as conservative or right-leaning. The framing of events, the portrayal of Democrat leaders, and the overall rhetoric all consistently align with themes and views commonly associated with conservative political thought."
newsmax,COVID,"Although Americans continue to be worried about the spread of COVID-19, the vast majority say it is time to accept it as part of life, according to a new Monmouth University Poll released on Monday.

A full 70% of Americans agree with the sentiment that ""it's time we accept that COVID is here to stay, and we just need to get on with our lives,"" including 78% of those who report having gotten the coronavirus, and 65% of those who say they have not been infected.

The survey finds a majority of the public continues to back some preventative measures, but not others.

For example, 52% support instituting, or reinstituting, face mask and social distancing guidelines in their home state, which is less than December (55%) and September (63%), but is the same as last July (52%) when COVID-19's spread was at its lowest ebb so far.

However, only 43% back requiring people to show proof of vaccination in order to work in an office or other setting where they are around other people after support was at 53% in September and 46% last month.

""We still see public support for maintaining some degree of public safety around COVID,"" Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said. ""However, there appears to be an acknowledgment that federal measures have not been effective, or at least have failed to be widely accepted.""

Other results from the poll indicate:
• Partisanship is the the main difference in the sense that it is time to move on — ranging from 89% of Republicans and 71% of independents to 47% of Democrats.
• Only 34% of the public feel the country will get the outbreak under control and return to normal by the end of the year, with 28% saying a return to normalcy will never happen, which is up from 22% who felt this way in September, and just 6% who were similarly pessimistic a year ago.
• Half, 50%, are either very (23%) or somewhat (27%) concerned about catching one of the new COVID variants. Even so, 37% remain unlikely to ever get a booster shot, including 17% who remain opposed even to getting the initial vaccination.
• Just 43% say President Joe Biden has done a good job on handling the pandemic, while 53% say he has done a bad job — the first time his rating on this metric has been underwater since he took office. Public opinion on the president’s handling of COVID-19 was evenly split a month ago (46% good job and 46% bad job) and was consistently positive in polls prior to that.
• Views of federal health agencies' handling of the pandemic have now fallen into negative territory (46% good job and 47% bad job) after declining but remaining positive a month ago (48% good and 41% bad).

The poll was carried out by telephone from Jan. 20-24, with 794 adults. The margin of error is +/- 3.5 percentage points.","A recent Monmouth University Poll has shown that a significant portion of Americans, 70%, are of the view that COVID-19 is a long-term reality we need to manage in our daily lives. This perspective is shared by 78% of people who have had the virus and 65% of those who haven't.

The poll also revealed that while the public supports some preventive steps, opinions vary on different measures. There is a slightly lower, yet still majority level of support (52%) for continued implementation of face masks and social distancing guidelines in comparison to previous months. On the other hand, less than half of those surveyed (43%) agree with mandatory proof of vaccination for those working in settings with other individuals, which is a decrease since September.

Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray indicated that while the public still generally favors some health safety protocols, there's also recognition of mixed opinions regarding federal mandates.

Additional insights from the poll include varying perspectives on moving past the pandemic, based on political affiliation; with higher numbers among Republicans and independents compared to Democrats. A minority of the population, 34%, believe that normalcy may be restored by the end of the year, yet an increasing portion (28%) think this might not happen at all, a sentiment that has grown from earlier polls.

Concerning the new COVID variants, half of Americans express varying degrees of worry, with some individuals hesitant or resistant to getting booster shots or initial vaccinations.

President Joe Biden's handling of the pandemic is currently viewed favorably by 43% of the respondents, with a larger number (53%) holding an unfavorable view, marking a shift from prior positive assessments. Similarly, the perspective on federal health agencies has seen a dip, now at a nearly even split between positive and negative opinions.

This poll was conducted through telephone interviews from January 20-24, with 794 adult participants, with a margin of error of ±3.5 percentage points.","Analyzing the article's use of language and rhetoric for underlying political ideology involves looking carefully at the choice of words, tone, and the framing of issues. Below are several instances where the language may suggest particular biases or viewpoints:

1. ""Although Americans continue to be worried about the spread of COVID-19, the vast majority say it is time to accept it as part of life.""
   - This language suggests a pragmatic or resignation viewpoint, potentially aligning with conservative or libertarian ideologies that emphasize individual freedom and personal responsibility over collective action and government intervention.

2. ""A full 70% of Americans agree with the sentiment that 'it's time we accept that COVID is here to stay, and we just need to get on with our lives,'""
   - The use of ""a full 70%"" presents a strong consensus among Americans, advocating for moving forward rather than focusing on COVID-19 preventative measures, which may resonate with right-leaning ideologies that prioritize the economy and oppose prolonged public health restrictions.

3. ""However, there appears to be an acknowledgment that federal measures have not been effective, or at least have failed to be widely accepted.""
   - This statement implies skepticism about the effectiveness and acceptance of federal interventions, a viewpoint often associated with conservative or libertarian perspectives that are critical of federal government involvement, preferring localized decision-making.

4. ""Partisanship is the main difference in the sense that it is time to move on — ranging from 89% of Republicans and 71% of independents to 47% of Democrats.""
   - This passage highlights the partisan divide on the issue, which can be seen as a nod toward the societal and ideological differences on handling the pandemic, with Republicans generally favoring less government intervention compared to Democrats.

5. ""Just 43% say President Joe Biden has done a good job on handling the pandemic, while 53% say he has done a bad job...""
   - The word ""just"" before the percentage of approval for Biden connotes a sense of inadequacy or underperformance, which can suggest a critical stance toward the current administration, aligning with a right-leaning bias that may disapprove of Biden's policies and actions.

6. ""Views of federal health agencies' handling of the pandemic have now fallen into negative territory...""
   - The phrase ""fallen into negative territory"" frames the performance of federal health agencies in a negative light, which may align with libertarian or conservative beliefs that are generally more critical of federal institutions and their efficiency.

While individual phrases may lean toward a particular political ideology, the article as a whole presents various perspectives and reports on statistical findings without strongly promoting a single ideology. Each expression of bias is subtle, and the article provides a multi-faceted view of the public's stance on COVID-19-related issues."
newsmax,COVID,"While it will take years to get going, there is a looming race for a casino in New York City, with Times Square, Citi Field, and Hudson Yards as potential prime locations for the world's largest untapped casino market.

State budget negotiations under Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul are weighing dropping a ban on new casinos until 2023, and New York City is a potential location that figures to bring one big-dollar lobbying.

""I believe in New York City; I think we are going to come back,"" Bally's Corp. Chair Soo Kim, who grew up on Queens, told Politico.

There are two horse tracks with video-lottery terminals in the New York City area, MGM's Resorts World New York City in Queens and Empire City Casino in Yonkers, but they figure to be the first houses to benefit when lobbyists get gambling laws to permit a full-fledged casino in the city.

""We are ready to deliver thousands of new jobs for Westchester and the Bronx while generating $1 billion in new economic activity with a full gaming license,"" MGM wrote in a statement, according to Politico. ""Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts is ready to roar.""

New York City, with 20 million people and once a tourist capital before the COVID-19 pandemic, has had its residents take their gambling budgets to Atlantic City, New Jersey, or Native American Casinos in Connecticut, but all that tax income could help the city rebound from economic downturn from the pandemic.

""With a responsible approach to pursuing new casino licenses downstate, we have a unique and timely opportunity to put unemployed hospitality workers back to work while also giving our economy a much needed boost,"" New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council President Rich Maroko.

His union backs a plan for Resorts World at Aqueduct Racetrack to become into a full casino, once 2014's gambling law is relaxed before 2023's exclusive licenses on New York's upstate casino houses expire.

""It's going to happen soon enough anyway – if we're ready to do it and all the infrastructure is in place and the regulatory structure is in place, why not do it sooner?"" state Sen. Mike Gianaris, D-Queens, told Politico.

In addition to the $500 million initiation fee hurdle, regulatory and tax burdens, there is opposition expected, particularly for the most choice locations of Manhattan.

""My concern, representing Manhattan and Times Square is the neighborhoods which would be adjacent to any proposed casino and the impact,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, told Politico. ""Casinos can have negative externalities, to put it mildly.

""I oppose them strongly and generally have done so in the legislature. When it is in my Senate district, it is even a greater concern.""

University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley political science professor Clyde Barrow is skeptical New York City can make enough to overcome the costs of operation.

""The state is going to look to maximize net new revenues and net new job growth in making the decision on where to locate them,"" Barrow told Politico. ""When you put a casino in the middle of nowhere or in a small city, there are limited alternative entertainment venues competing against it.

""But when you put a casino in Manhattan or in Queens, you are competing against every other entertainment, amusement and recreation facility in that city, so it is a vastly more competitive market in which people have lots of other alternatives on how to spend their entertainment dollars.""

""It will generate hundreds of millions of dollars, but it won’t be anywhere near the revenue generation forecasts.""","New discussions are underway regarding the possibility of lifting a ban on establishing new casinos in the state, with anticipated changes to legislation potentially coming before 2023. New York City is considered a prime candidate to house a new casino, given its large population and tourism industry.

Soo Kim, Chair of Bally's Corp., has expressed confidence in New York City's economic resurgence and has indicated a strong interest in the opportunities a casino could provide for the area.

Currently, the city has two horse tracks that offer video-lottery terminals, Resorts World New York City in Queens and Empire City Casino in Yonkers. Both are keen to upgrade their facilities to full casino operations in anticipation of changes in gambling laws.

MGM Resorts has stated they are prepared to introduce a wealth of new jobs and significant economic activity with a full gaming license. They argue that allowing a casino license for their Empire City Casino would not only create job opportunities but would also stimulate the economy.

The prospect of new casinos in New York City also comes with the possibility of retaining the flow of tax revenue locally, which has been lost to neighboring states as residents travel out of state to gamble.

Highlighting the potential for economic revival, the New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council President Rich Maroko has advocated for issuing new casino licenses in the downstate area, emphasizing job creation and economic stimulus.

State discussions are also underway to determine the best timing and approach for this initiative. State Sen. Mike Gianaris has reflected on whether proactive steps should be taken in this regard, given that current infrastructure and regulatory measures could support such a development.

However, there is noted opposition, especially concerning the prospect of siting a casino in prime locations such as Manhattan. State Sen. Brad Hoylman has expressed concerns regarding the impact on the neighborhoods adjacent to any potential casino site.

Experts are also weighing in on the matter, with Clyde Barrow, a political science professor, sharing his skepticism about the financial benefits of a casino in a city like New York, which has a highly competitive entertainment market. He questions whether the generated revenue would meet expectations given the substantial competition.

These developments represent a significant potential shift in New York City's economic and entertainment landscape as stakeholders continue to weigh the implications and benefits against the potential challenges of introducing a new casino to the city.","Based on the provided article, several statements infer the political ideologies of the individuals involved or the inferred stance of the article itself. 

1. ""State budget negotiations under Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul are weighing dropping a ban on new casinos until 2023...""
- This suggests that the current Democratic administration is considering changing the legislation to permit new casinos earlier than planned, indicating a potential liberal or progressive approach to economic development through relaxed regulatory measures.

2. ""I believe in New York City; I think we are going to come back,"" Bally's Corp. Chair Soo Kim...
- This statement conveys optimism and a pro-growth attitude, which could be associated with either liberal or conservative ideologies, depending on the context. However, without an explicit indication of political bias, it functions primarily as a positive assertion about the city's future.

3. ""...has had its residents take their gambling budgets to Atlantic City, New Jersey, or Native American Casinos in Connecticut, but all that tax income could help the city rebound from economic downturn from the pandemic.""
- This appeals to a more pragmatic and possibly conservative concern for local tax revenue generation, which suggests that capturing potential tax income is a priority, hinting at fiscal conservative values related to self-funding through internal economic activity.

4. ""With a responsible approach to pursuing new casino licenses downstate...""
- The usage of ""responsible approach"" could suggest either a moderate conservative or liberal ideology, emphasizing fiscal responsibility and cautious development.

5. ""My concern, representing Manhattan and Times Square is the neighborhoods which would be adjacent to any proposed casino and the impact,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan...
- Senator Hoylman's concerns about the local communities could reflect a more liberal viewpoint, with a focus on potential social costs and community impact commonly associated with casino development.

6. ""University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley political science professor Clyde Barrow is skeptical New York City can make enough to overcome the costs of operation.""
- The skepticism about the economic viability reflects a critical analysis that doesn't specifically lean either liberal or conservative but focuses on the practical concerns regarding the economic projections versus reality.

Overall, the article itself doesn't show a clear bias or political standpoint, reporting the diverse opinions and considerations from different stakeholders regarding the potential introduction of casinos in New York City. The viewpoints expressed reflect the typical concerns, interests, and ideologies that are common in debates over urban development and economic policy, with both practical economic considerations as well as social implications being discussed."
newsmax,Climate Change,"Connecticut U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has $7.5 million in campaign cash and enviable name recognition after decades in public office, but Republicans in this Democratic-leaning state still see an opportunity to win a U.S. Senate seat after a roughly 30-year drought.

Top state Republicans are touting Themis Klarides, the former GOP leader in the state House of Representatives, as a formidable challenger with the best chance of capitalizing on the strong national headwinds facing Democrats this election year.

State Democrats remain confident Blumenthal, 76, will win a third six-year term. But if Klarides receives her party's endorsement in May, it will mark the first time Blumenthal has faced a challenge from such a well-known state politician. Klarides served more than two decades in the General Assembly, representing Derby, Orange and Woodbridge, and was the first woman to lead the House Republican caucus before retiring in 2021.

The 56-year-old lawyer, former model and bodybuilder who worked as a “ring girl” for the WWE while studying for the bar exam, initially considered running for governor. She announced her pivot to the Senate race in January, saying she believes she can win over voters with her moderate stances on social issues, such as support for abortion and gay rights, and conservative views on fiscal issues.

“I’ve talked to a lot of unaffiliateds and a lot of Democrats that are really disenchanted with Sen. Blumenthal; disenchanted that he follows party line and he’s partisan in whatever he does,” she said. ”He has not put Connecticut first, and his time has come to retire.""

Blumenthal has publicly avoided commenting on the race, telling The Associated Press — after a recent visit to Poland to learn about the Ukraine war — that he's focused on doing his job. He has cosponsored bills to limit the purchase of Russian energy and seize luxury assets tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“There will be plenty of time to talk about the campaign,"" he said.

However, in fundraising appeals, Blumenthal warns his supporters he's “up against radical Trump-loyalist opponents who want to flip this seat” and says his campaign needs help to ensure Democratic control of the Senate: “With everything from reproductive rights to voting rights to climate justice and more on the line, falling short is not an option.”

Klarides has been both critical and supportive of former President Donald Trump over the years, and said while she has heard from his supporters already, she expects to benefit more from voters' general frustration.

National Republicans have not officially weighed in on Connecticut's Senate race yet, considering there's still a potential primary. But at least two independent super PACs, which can raise unlimited sums of money, have been formed, signaling that outside groups are interested. One is backing Klarides and the other is supporting Leora Levy, a conservative Republican from Greenwich who is the state's Republican National Committeewoman and holds other party positions.

Other Republicans vying for the party's endorsement include Peter Lumaj, a conservative Republican and attorney from Fairfield who has previously run for statewide office; Robert Hyde of Canton, a 2019 congressional candidate who was asked to end that bid by top Republicans following vulgar tweets; John Flynn of Norwalk, a carpenter, painter and former state legislative candidate; and small business owner Nicholas Connors of New Canaan.

Bryan Cafferelli, a member of the Republican State Central Committee, is among those who have urged Republicans to “unify around Themis” and avoid a potentially damaging primary.

Ben Proto, the state's GOP chair, said President Joe Biden’s slumping approval ratings will boost all Republican candidates in Connecticut, even against a high vote-getter like Blumenthal. He likened the situation to the 1994 midterms, when the GOP took control of Congress and won the Connecticut governor’s race.

“There’s clearly a wave coming,” he said, tying Blumenthal to the Biden administration's policies on coronavirus mandates, rising inflation and high gas prices. Blumenthal has proposed suspending the federal gas tax.

Republicans are also likely to attack Blumenthal for attending a December event with ties to the Communist Party. He has said he was not aware of the affiliation.

Blumenthal’s last tight contest was in 2010, his first run for U.S. Senate. Republican Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive, spent $50 million on the race. McMahon’s camp had boasted it was responsible for reporting in The New York Times revealing Blumenthal repeatedly told audiences he served in Vietnam, when he actually remained stateside with the Marine Reserve during the war. Blumenthal apologized, telling voters he “misspoke” and never intended to mislead anyone. While in office, Trump frequently called Blumenthal derogatory names referencing the issue.

In Connecticut, the GOP faces a challenge when it comes to the numbers. As of October 2021, there were fewer than 465,000 active registered Republicans compared to more than 825,00 active Democrats and 930,000 active unaffiliated voters. Meanwhile, Blumenthal's supporters say the former U.S. attorney, who began his political career in the General Assembly in 1984 and later served an unprecedented five terms as state attorney general, has built up a tremendous amount of goodwill.

Nancy DiNardo, chair of the state's Democratic Party, said she isn't worried at all about Blumenthal.

“The people of Connecticut know the job he has done and appreciate the work that he has done for Connecticut and its citizens,” she said. “He did a phenomenal job as attorney general, and he continues to do a phenomenal job as a U.S. senator.""","Connecticut U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has accumulated $7.5 million for his campaign and is widely recognized due to his long tenure in public office. Despite Connecticut's history of electing Democratic officials, Republicans believe they have a chance to secure a U.S. Senate seat, a victory that has eluded them for roughly three decades.

Themis Klarides, the former leader of the Republican minority in the state House of Representatives, is considered a strong contender capable of leveraging the current political climate in the upcoming elections. 

Blumenthal, at 76, is running for a third six-year term and has thus far concentrated on his work in the Senate over engaging in campaign discussions. His recent legislative efforts include initiatives aimed at restricting the purchase of Russian energy and targeting assets associated with Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to the Ukraine conflict.

On the other hand, Klarides, with her experience in the General Assembly for over twenty years and her background as a lawyer, former model, and bodybuilder, has set her sights on the Senate seat after previously contemplating a bid for governor. In January, she declared her candidacy for the Senate, emphasizing her aim to appeal to a broad electorate with her approach to various social and fiscal issues.

While national political organizations have yet to formally take a stand in Connecticut's Senate race, independent political action committees have shown an interest in the contest. These groups, unrestricted by fundraising limits, highlight the attention the race is drawing. Among other Republican candidates seeking endorsement are Peter Lumaj, Robert Hyde, John Flynn, and Nicholas Connors, each bringing diverse experiences and viewpoints to the primary process.

State Republican Party officials are anticipating that the broader political environment, including Biden's approval figures, could influence the outcome in Connecticut, drawing parallels to historical shifts in political power.

Blumenthal has been a fixture in Connecticut politics, serving as a U.S. attorney and state attorney general for five terms prior to his election to the Senate. His supporters credit him with significant contributions to the state during his career.

In terms of party affiliation, there are fewer active registered Republicans than Democrats or unaffiliated voters as of the latest figures. Nevertheless, Republican candidates are focusing on uniting their base and reaching out to the wider electorate in their campaign strategies. Meanwhile, Democratic Party representatives express confidence in Blumenthal's track record and his performance as a senator.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric of this article reveals some indicators of political ideology. Here are instances and explanations:

1. ""Democratic-leaning state"" - This indicates that the state traditionally favors Democratic candidates, framing the political landscape as one ostensibly more favorable to Democrats.

2. ""Republicans...still see an opportunity"" - The word ""opportunity"" suggests optimism and potential for success within the Republican Party, perhaps implying they have a significant chance despite historical trends.

3. ""strong national headwinds facing Democrats"" - The phrase ""strong national headwinds"" evokes a sense of difficulty and resistance that the Democratic Party is purportedly encountering, suggesting a troubled political climate for the incumbent party.

4. ""moderate stances on social issues"" - Referring to Klarides' ""moderate stances"" implies a centrist approach to politics that could be appealing to a broad range of voters, highlighting a strategic positioning rather than an extreme ideological viewpoint.

5. ""conservative views on fiscal issues"" - This statement underscores the candidate's alignment with Republican fiscal ideology without necessarily employing a positively or negatively charged descriptor, which might suggest a more neutral stance of the author.

6. ""disenchanted with Sen. Blumenthal"" - The use of ""disenchanted"" to describe voter sentiment toward Blumenthal conveys a negative connotation, implying that there is a level of dissatisfaction that could play into the electoral dynamics.

7. ""radical Trump-loyalist opponents"" - The adjective ""radical"" serves to position the opposition to Blumenthal in extreme terms, indicating that the article views this faction of the Republican Party as far from the center.

8. ""flip this seat"" and ""everything from reproductive rights to voting rights to climate justice and more on the line"" - This language from Blumenthal's fundraising appeals is charged with urgency and uses progressive causes to convey the stakes of the election, signaling a liberal-progressive ideological stance.

9. ""President Joe Biden’s slumping approval ratings"" - The characterization of Biden's approval ratings as ""slumping"" captures the current perceived weakness in the Democratic executive leadership and implies a potential drag on associated candidates like Blumenthal.

10. ""There’s clearly a wave coming"" - This phrase implies an impending change that is suggestive of the Republican narrative of gaining momentum, echoing the language often used in politics to describe a significant shift in voter sentiment.

11. ""Republicans are also likely to attack Blumenthal for attending a December event with ties to the Communist Party"" - The use of ""attack"" and the reference to ""the Communist Party"" is meant to draw associations between Blumenthal and a political ideology that is typically viewed negatively within American political discourse.

12. ""Blumenthal's supporters say the former U.S. attorney...has built up a tremendous amount of goodwill"" - This passage highlights the positive aspects of Blumenthal's career without critically examining them, suggesting a favorable bias toward the incumbent.

In summary, the article frames the political contest with terms that reflect the perceived strengths and challenges of both parties, using language that indicates the uphill battle for Republicans in a Democratic-leaning state, while also emphasizing the discontent and strategic positioning that could benefit the Republican candidate. The rhetoric is somewhat balanced with positive notions for both sides, but it includes charged terms that convey a sense of urgency and competition influenced by broader national trends and sentiments."
newsmax,Climate Change,"Vladimir Putin is ""taking advantage"" of a ""weak"" President Joe Biden, who has made ""America a weak sister"" after the ""catastrophic"" Afghanistan withdrawal, according to economist Larry Kudlow, who said Putin needs to be given an ultimatum to stand down by March 1, or face crippling sanctions.

""The president keeps forecast, keeps predicting that Russia is going to invade,"" Kudlow told Sunday's ""The Cats Roundtable"" on WABC 770 AM-N.Y. ""Why he keeps making these predictions is utterly beyond me.

""He is allowing Putin to control this and that really bothers me, that runs contrary to American interests. Obviously, Biden is not an America First guy.""

Kudlow said overdue economic pressure needs to be put on Putin in the way of a deadline to impose sanctions.

""Set a March 1 deadline: 'If your troops do not return to their proper barracks, then we will, as of March 1, impose strict across-the-board banking and energy sanctions'; just like that,"" Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.

""In the aftermath of the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan America looks like a weak sister. Biden is a weak president. Putin is taking advantage of that.""

This is not just about Ukraine and NATO, Kudlow warned, because other territories around the world will be next.

""If we let Putin do this scot-free, John, then China will figure out after the Olympics, 'Why can't they take over Taiwan?'"" Kudlow said, noting the world is watching how we .

""I'm suggesting to you: The lack of deadlines, the lack of clarity, the lack of sanctions has done damage here.""

Behind all of this is money, riches, energy, and oil – and not necessarily just NATO admission as Putin has claimed as a pretext for his border buildup. If fact, Putin can now enrich his country and damage America even by self-imposing sanctions, according to Kudlow.

""If Russia says we are not going to put any natural gas out into Europe, that will drive oil energy prices sky high, the price of oil to $150 [per barrel], and will have grave economic consequences for the United States,"" Kudlow said.

Biden's ""waging a jihad against fossil fuels"" for Green New Deal progressives is proving costly for wealth and security worldwide, Kudlow concluded.

""While the world needs more oil and the world needs more natural gas, literally, to survive, Biden is doing everything he can through the regulatory arm in Washington to stop it: Now, to me that is incredibly stupid,"" he said, pointing to the ""closing down the XL Pipeline but allowing Nord Stream 2 to reopen.""

""I don't understand this. I am baffled by it; it's very bad policy; it's a sign of weakness.""","Economist Larry Kudlow expressed concern over the current international dynamics, referencing the situation with President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Kudlow, the United States appears to be in a less authoritative position following the withdrawal from Afghanistan. He opined that more definitive economic measures should be employed, suggesting a deadline for sanctions against Russia if troops do not return to their bases.

Kudlow discussed the implications of such international affairs on the global stage, expressing the perspective that other global powers might be observing and potentially taking cues from these events. He emphasized the importance of clear deadlines and sanctions in upholding international agreements and preserving global stability.

Regarding energy policies, Kudlow critiqued the current administration's approach, suggesting that it could have wide-reaching economic impacts. He noted the significance of energy resources on both geopolitical and economic fronts, mentioning the potential effects of shifts in energy exports from Russia to Europe and the ramifications on oil prices.

The article also touched on Kudlow's views about the current U.S. energy policies, including the decision to halt the XL Pipeline project while allowing the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to progress. Kudlow underscored the need for increased oil and natural gas production given the global demand and questioned the strategic rationale behind the existing energy policy decisions.","The article contains several instances of language and rhetoric indicative of a particular political ideology. Here are some examples:
 
1. ""Vladimir Putin is 'taking advantage' of a 'weak' President Joe Biden.""
   - This language suggests a viewpoint that perceives the current U.S. leadership as ineffective and lacking strength, a common critique from conservative commentators. It plays into the narrative that strong leadership is a necessary deterrent against geopolitical adversaries.

2. ""America a weak sister after the 'catastrophic' Afghanistan withdrawal.""
   - The term ""weak sister"" implies that the United States, under Biden's leadership, is the weaker member of a family (or, by extension, a group of nations). The description of the Afghanistan withdrawal as ""catastrophic"" reinforces the narrative of failure and incompetence, often emphasized by those who support a more hawkish foreign policy.

3. ""Obviously, Biden is not an America First guy.""
   - The phrase ""America First"" references a specific nationalistic approach to diplomacy that prioritizes American interests above those of other nations. Criticizing Biden for not following this approach suggests a bias for a more nationalist, conservative ideology.

4. ""Biden is a weak president. Putin is taking advantage of that.""
   - Reiterating the theme of weakness, this explicitly labels the U.S. president as insufficient in standing up to Putin, a stance that implies a preference for more assertive leadership often associated with conservative viewpoints.

5. ""China will figure out after the Olympics, 'Why can't they take over Taiwan?'""
   - This comment plays into fears of authoritarian regimes engaging in expansionist policies and criticizes perceived inaction as a potential cause of future conflict. This reflects a viewpoint that favors aggressive preventive measures over a more diplomatic or cautious approach.

6. ""Biden's 'waging a jihad against fossil fuels' for Green New Deal progressives.""
   - Using the term ""jihad"" in this context is a highly loaded choice, as it can evoke associations with extremism. This phrase indicates that the author is critical of progressive environmental policies, aligning with a conservative or right-leaning ideology that prioritizes economic concerns of the fossil fuel industry.

7. ""The lack of deadlines, the lack of clarity, the lack of sanctions has done damage here.""
   - The criticism of Biden's policies for lacking concrete actions and timelines suggests support for a more decisive and possibly unilateral approach to foreign policy, which is often found in neo-conservative ideologies.

8. ""I don't understand this. I am baffled by it; it's very bad policy; it's a sign of weakness.""
   - The closing remarks express confusion and disapproval of the current administration's actions, labeling them as ""very bad policy"" without an in-depth examination of their effectiveness or rationale. This rhetorical strategy dismisses the opposition's views as not only wrong but incomprehensible, reinforcing the author's own ideological stance that favors strength and decisiveness.

Overall, the language and rhetoric in this article primarily align with a conservative, nationalist viewpoint that is critical of what it perceives as weak, indecisive leadership, particularly in foreign policy and energy sectors."
newsmax,Economy,"Former President Donald Trump must answer questions under oath in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into his business practices, a state appeals court ruled Thursday, rejecting his argument that he be excused from testifying because his answers could be used in a parallel criminal probe.

A four-judge panel in the appellate division of the state’s trial court upheld Judge Arthur Engoron's Feb. 17 ruling, which enforced subpoenas requiring that Trump and his two eldest children — Ivanka and Donald Jr. — give deposition testimony in Attorney General Letitia James’ probe.

""The existence of a criminal investigation does not preclude civil discovery of related facts, at which a party may exercise the privilege against self-incrimination,"" the appellate panel wrote, citing the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and other legal protections for witnesses.

Lawyers for the Trumps agreed in March that they would sit for depositions within 14 days of an appellate panel decision upholding Engoron’s ruling. They could also appeal the decision to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, delaying the matter and the Trumps’ potential testimony indefinitely.

A message seeking comment was left with lawyers for the Trumps.

James lauded the ruling, which came just two weeks after the appellate panel heard oral arguments in the case. She tweeted that her investigation ""will continue undeterred because no one is above the law.""

""Once again, the courts have ruled that Donald Trump must comply with our lawful investigation into his financial dealings,"" James said in a written statement.

""We will continue to follow the facts of this case and ensure that no one can evade the law.""

James has said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, used “fraudulent or misleading” valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits. Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. have both been executives in the Trump Organization and are among their father’s most trusted allies.

The appellate panel, in its ruling, described the investigation as focusing on whether the Trumps ""committed persistent fraud in their financial practices and disclosures.""

Trump, a Republican, denies the allegations and has said James' investigation in part of a politically motivated ""witch hunt.""

In appealing Engoron’s subpoena ruling, his lawyers argued that James, a Democrat, was engaging in ""selective prosecution."" The appellate panel rejected that, saying the investigation was on solid legal footing and that the Trumps showed no evidence they or their company were ""treated differently"" than other companies under similar scrutiny.

A lawyer for the Trumps, Alan Futerfas, told the appellate panel in oral arguments on May 11 that James appeared to be using civil subpoenas to get around a New York law that requires immunity for people testifying before a criminal grand jury.

Judith Vale, arguing on behalf of James’ office, countered there was ample evidence from the civil investigation to support subpoenas for the Trumps’ testimony.

She also cited legal precedent allowing the attorney general’s office to do so, and said the Trumps could always invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination — as Trump’s son Eric did hundreds of times in a 2020 deposition.

Appellate Court Judge Rolando T. Acosta appeared to agree with that position, foreshadowing Thursday’s ruling as he questioned Futerfas from the bench.

Anything Trump says in a civil deposition in James’ investigation could be used against him in the criminal probe being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

Last summer, spurred by evidence uncovered by James' office, the DA's office charged the Trump Organization and its longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, with tax fraud, alleging he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty.

Thursday's appellate court ruling was the latest in a flurry of legal activity involving Trump and the attorney general’s investigation in the last few weeks.

Last week, Trump paid $110,000 in fines and met several other conditions as he seeks to end a contempt of court order Engoron issued on April 25 after he was slow to respond to another subpoena from James seeking documents and other evidence.

On Monday, James’ office said it had subpoenaed Trump’s longtime executive assistant, Rhona Graff, and planned to question her under oath next week in the probe.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in New York is expected to rule soon in a lawsuit Trump filed against James in December in an attempt to shut down her investigation. Trump’s lawyers want an injunction to halt the probe. James' office is seeking to throw out the lawsuit.

At a May 13 hearing in the federal case, a lawyer for James’ office said it was ""nearing the end"" of the probe and that “there’s clearly been a substantial amount of evidence” to support a civil enforcement proceeding, although a final determination hasn't been made.

Since James' investigation is civil in nature, she could end up bringing a lawsuit and seeking financial penalties against Trump or his company, or even a ban on them being involved in certain types of businesses.

That's what happened in January when a judge barred ex-drug company CEO Martin Shkreli from the pharmaceutical industry for life.","Former President Donald Trump is required to respond to questions under oath as part of the New York attorney general’s civil inquiry into his business operations, a state appeals court ruled on Thursday. This decision comes after Trump's legal team argued that he should be exempt from testifying due to concerns that his responses could be applied in a concurrent criminal investigation.

The state trial court’s appellate division, consisting of a four-judge panel, upheld a previous ruling by Judge Arthur Engoron, made on February 17, which enforced subpoenas for Trump and his two eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Jr., to provide depositions in the investigation led by Attorney General Letitia James.

The panel emphasized that participation in a criminal investigation does not exclude individuals from civil discovery processes, where they retain the right to invoke the Fifth Amendment — a protection against self-incrimination.

Trump's attorneys have consented to arranging the depositions within a 14-day window following an appellate panel ruling that affirms Judge Engoron’s decision. However, the Trump legal team also has the option to seek further appeal to the state's highest court, potentially postponing the depositions.

The legal representatives for the Trumps have not yet publicly commented on the ruling.

The investigation conducted by Attorney General James into the financial activities of the Trump Organization suggests possible misleading asset valuations were utilized to secure loans and tax advantages. Both Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., who have held executive roles in the Trump Organization, are among the figures involved in the investigation.

The appellate panel characterized the inquiry as examining whether there have been ongoing deceptive practices in financial affairs and disclosures by the Trumps.

Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing, characterizing the inquiry as politically influenced. However, the appellate panel dismissed claims of selective prosecution, indicating that the investigation rests on a strong legal foundation and highlighting that there was no demonstration of unequal treatment compared to other similarly investigated companies.

During the legal process, one of Trump’s attorneys, Alan Futerfas, suggested that the attorney general's office was using civil subpoenas to sidestep laws around immunity in the context of criminal grand jury testimonies. James' office, represented by Judith Vale, argued there was substantial evidence to justify the subpoenas and stated that legal precedent supported their action.

Information gathered in a civil deposit in the context of James’ probe could potentially be used in a separate criminal investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. This came into focus when the DA’s office, informed by findings from James’ office, charged the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, with tax fraud last summer. Weisselberg and the organization pleaded not guilty to these charges.

In recent developments, Trump met specific requirements, including paying $110,000 in fines, in an effort to resolve a contempt of court order issued by Judge Engoron on April 25, related to a delayed response to another subpoena that sought various documents and evidence.

The office of the attorney general also announced plans to depose Trump’s long-serving executive assistant, Rhona Graff, as a part of their ongoing investigation. A federal judge in New York is also anticipated to deliver a verdict soon on a lawsuit initiated by Trump against James aiming to terminate her inquiry.

At a hearing held on May 13 regarding the lawsuit, a representative for the attorney general's office indicated that the investigation was in its concluding stages and that evidence collected thus far was supportive of a potential civil enforcement action, although a final assessment has not yet been established.

Should the civil nature of James' investigation lead to legal proceedings, It could result in the implementation of financial penalties or place restrictions on Trump or his business’ operations in certain sectors. This took place previously when a judge imposed a lifetime ban on former pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli from the industry.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric of the provided article reveals a neutral to slightly formal journalistic style, typical of mainstream news reporting. The article appears focused on delivering information about legal proceedings involving former President Donald Trump without overtly endorsing a political ideology. Here are instances where language might suggest a nuanced viewpoint:

1. ""Former President Donald Trump must answer questions under oath...""
   - The use of ""must"" indicates a factual statement regarding the legal obligation Trump has, which does not inherently suggest bias.

2. ""Trump and his two eldest children — Ivanka and Donald Jr. — give deposition testimony...""
   - The inclusion of Trump's children by name aligns with standard reporting practices and doesn't indicate a biased viewpoint.

3. ""James lauded the ruling...""
   - While the phrase ""lauded"" shows a positive reaction from Attorney General Letitia James, it is a direct reporting of her stance rather than the article expressing its own viewpoint.

4. ""The courts have ruled that Donald Trump must comply with our lawful investigation...""
   - This quote from James emphasizes the legality of the investigation and supports the narrative of equal treatment under the law, suggesting a legalistic and potentially establishment viewpoint, but not overt bias.

5. ""James has said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump’s company... used 'fraudulent or misleading' valuations...""
   - Including the claims from James presents her perspective, which could infer a viewpoint that takes allegations of wrongdoing seriously.

6. ""Trump, a Republican, denies the allegations and has said James' investigation is part of a politically motivated 'witch hunt.'""
   - The article fairly includes Trump's dismissal of the investigation as a ""witch hunt,"" which reflects his perspective and hints at a potentially adversarial political atmosphere without espousing a particular stance.

7. ""The appellate panel rejected that, saying the investigation was on solid legal footing...""
   - Mentioning that the appellate panel found the investigation legally sound provides a counterpoint to the claims of bias made by Trump's lawyers, which could suggest the article is placing weight on the judicial system's viewpoint.

8. ""Trump’s son Eric did hundreds of times in a 2020 deposition.""
   - Pointing out the frequency that Eric Trump invoked the Fifth Amendment may imply skepticism toward the Trumps' willingness to provide information, but it does not necessarily reflect an overarching ideology.

9. ""Last summer, spurred by evidence uncovered by James' office, the DA's office charged the Trump Organization and its longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, with tax fraud...""
   - The mention of charges already brought forth might imply the gravity of the situation, but it is an informative statement about the consequences of the investigation.

10. ""Trump paid $110,000 in fines and met several other conditions as he seeks to end a contempt of court order...""
    - This factually reports on actions Trump took in response to legal processes and does not suggest bias.

11. ""Since James' investigation is civil in nature...""
    - The article concludes by outlining potential outcomes of a civil nature, signifying the legal context without promoting a particular political ideology.

Overall, while the article reports on legal challenges faced by a political figure, it does so with a focus on the legal proceedings and the positions of the parties involved rather than promoting a specific political ideology."
newsmax,Economy,"President Joe Biden has pushed his ""buy American"" agenda, but he doesn't want to follow that policy when it comes to buying oil and gas produced in the United States because his administration is ""very beholden to the environmental left,"" Sen. James Lankford said Thursday on Newsmax.

""They're running the White House at this point,"" the Oklahoma Republican said on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America."" ""Their goal is to reduce energy production in the United States, knowing full well that we have to have that energy from somewhere, but they want to be able to stand up and crow and say the United States has reduced our carbon footprint.""

That comes while oil is bought from other places, including Russia, but to the environmentalists, the other countries can have a ""bad environmental score"" as long as a good score is achieved in the United States, and that is ""irrational,"" said Lankford.

""If you're going to talk about clean production, no one produces oil cleaner than the United States of America, so it's nonsensical policy,"" the senator added.

Lankford also commented on the Labor Department's report released Thursday showing the nation's inflation rate is now at 7.9% or the largest spike seen since 1982, pointing out that the inflation growth can't be blamed on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

""People need to remember, that's the inflation index going up before the war that happened in Ukraine,"" said Lankford. ""This is the Biden policies. This is what he put into place last March when everyone told him not to dump $2 trillion into a growing economy, when they did that, anyway. It causes inflation. Inflation feeds inflation. It's very hard to be able to stop and the American people are going to continue to suffer from this.""

It's also ""spin"" to blame the growing prices on gasoline and other goods on Russia or President Vladimir Putin, said Lankford. ""They're hoping everyone forgets the last year and how much prices rose all last year.""

He added: ""All the problems that we've had in the last year are based on their policies, and most Americans don't know because we don't track the inflation in other countries. Japan has not experienced this. South Korea hasn't, Australia hasn't, the U.K., Germany, all these other countries didn't experience inflation like we have. The difference was that Biden's policies that he put in place spurred this kind of inflation.""

Russia has warned that banning its oil could make prices reach $300 a barrel or more, and Lankford said if that happens, it would affect Europe most, as it depends on Russia for 38% of its energy needs.

Europe's countries are already talking about returning to former production systems, with Germany talking about reopening its coal-fired power plants and France speaking about a return to nuclear, said Lankford.

Meanwhile, it will be decades before the use of electric vehicles will be widely seen, Lankford said.

""We only have 2% of electrical vehicles on the road,"" he said. ""They're talking about doubling that number in the next 10 years. Well, great, that's 4%. That's not going to get us there.""

The senator on Thursday said he won't be endorsing any candidates to replace Sen. James Inhofe, after the 87-year-old Oklahoma Republican announced his retirement, but said he is proud of Inhofe for his service and that he's ""retiring with honor.""

However, when it comes to the acquisition of oil and gas, the Administration seems to prioritize other factors beyond domestic production, Senator James Lankford mentioned during an appearance on Newsmax.

The Administration seems focused on reducing domestic energy production as part of a broader strategy to lower the nation's carbon emissions, even though this might necessitate importing energy from abroad, Lankford suggested.

Lankford noted that when purchasing oil from other nations, including Russia, the United States considers a variety of factors beyond just the environmental record of the exporting countries.

The Senator pointed out that the United States is among the countries that produce oil with comparatively high environmental standards, and questioned the effectiveness of current energy policies.

In relation to the nation's economic situation, Lankford referenced a Labor Department report indicating that the inflation rate had risen to 7.9%, the highest since 1982. He stated that the increase in inflation had occurred before recent global events, implying that domestic policy decisions from the past year played a role.

The Senator also commented that attributing rising gas prices and other inflationary pressures solely to external factors like the situation in Russia could be overlooking contributing domestic policies.

Commenting on global energy dynamics, Lankford mentioned that a potential ban on Russian oil imports could significantly impact oil prices worldwide and could particularly affect Europe, which is reliant on Russian energy. In light of this, some European countries are considering returning to different forms of energy production, he added.

Lankford remarked on the gradual transition to electric vehicles, observing that at present, electric vehicles make up a small fraction of all vehicles on the road.

Lastly, concerning local politics, Lankford stated he would not endorse any candidate to succeed retiring Senator James Inhofe, though he expressed admiration for Inhofe's years of service.","The given article presents certain phrases and rhetoric that signal a particular political bias or viewpoint. Below are examples sequenced with their corresponding explanations of ideology:

1. ""President Joe Biden has pushed his 'buy American' agenda, but he doesn't want to follow that policy when it comes to buying oil and gas produced in the United States"" - This statement sets up a contrast that suggests hypocrisy or inconsistency in President Biden's policy approach, a common critique in conservative rhetoric that aims to undermine the credibility of a political figure.

2. ""his administration is 'very beholden to the environmental left,' Sen. James Lankford said"" - The use of the term ""beholden to the environmental left"" implies that the Biden administration is not making independent policy decisions but rather is influenced by a single interest group, in this case, environmentalists. This is an assertion common among conservative politicians who are critical of environmental regulations and favor fossil fuel industries.

3. ""They're running the White House at this point"" - This phrase suggests that the environmental left has extreme influence or control over the White House, which aligns with a conservative view that portrays environmental policy decisions as disproportionate to other considerations, such as energy independence or economic impacts.

4. ""Their goal is to reduce energy production in the United States"" - Here, the article attributes a goal to the environmental faction that is presented unfavorably. The implication is that reducing energy production, typically associated with an environmental or left-leaning agenda, is counterproductive or damaging to the nation’s interests.

5. ""while oil is bought from other places, including Russia"" - By specifically mentioning Russia, the statement evokes current geopolitical tensions and potentially criticizes the international aspects of the current administration’s energy policies.

6. ""irrational"" - Labeling policy as irrational strongly implies that the opposing ideology is not based on sound reasoning, a technique to persuade the reader of the author's viewpoint.

7. ""no one produces oil cleaner than the United States of America"" - This is an assertion made without evidence that appears to promote the national interest and the superiority of U.S. practices, downplaying environmental concerns in favor of nationalistic rhetoric often found in conservative dialogue.

8. ""This is the Biden policies"" - This straightforwardly attributes responsibility for the described issues, in this case, inflation, directly to President Biden's policies, reinforcing the notion of poor governance and decision-making on the part of the current administration, a perspective commonly espoused by political opponents.

9. ""spin"" - The term ""spin"" suggests that the administration is manipulating the truth or misleading the public, a claim that indicates a distrust of the current government's narrative.

10. ""All the problems that we've had in the last year are based on their policies"" - This sweeping statement implies that all recent problems are the result of the administration's actions, a broad critique that seeks to discredit the entirety of the administration's policy decisions.

The consistent theme across these examples is a critical stance against President Biden and his administration's policies, particularly with respect to energy and environmental strategies. The language suggests a conservative viewpoint that emphasizes negative consequences of the administration's actions, downplays environmental considerations in favor of economic and nationalistic ones, and alleges undue influence from the ""environmental left."""
newsmax,Election,"A judge in New York has ordered Rudy Giuliani to appear next month before a special grand jury in Atlanta that's investigating claims that former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 general election in Georgia.

New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber on July 13 issued an order directing Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor, to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 9 and on any other dates ordered by the court in Atlanta, according to documents filed Wednesday in Fulton County Superior Court.

Giuliani's lawyer did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment Wednesday.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis began her investigation early last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request. In a letter requesting the special grand jury, she said her team was looking into “any coordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state.”

Earlier this month, she filed petitions to compel seven Trump associates, including Giuliani and U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, to testify before the special grand jury.

Because they don't live in Georgia, she had to use a process that involves getting a judge in the state where they live to order them to appear.

Giuliani had been summoned to appear in court in New York on July 13 to present any reasons why a subpoena should not be issued for him to testify in Atlanta, but he failed to show up for the hearing, Farber wrote in his order.

In the court filing Wednesday, Willis informed the judge overseeing the special grand jury that Giuliani had been served with Farber's final order instructing him to appear before the special grand jury.

It’s possible that Giuliani could file a motion with the court in Atlanta to try to avoid testifying.

Graham, who has denied any wrongdoing, reached an agreement with Willis yesterday that said he would file any challenge to the attempt to compel his testimony in Georgia, either in Fulton County Superior Court or in federal court in Atlanta, rather than in South Carolina or Washington, where Willis was planning to try to get a judge to issue a subpoena.

U.S. Rep. Jody Hice filed a challenge to a subpoena issued for his testimony in federal court in Atlanta. He has argued that his actions after the election were done in his role as a member of Congress and are shielded from legal proceedings and inquiry. A judge is set to hear arguments on that next week.

Georgia's lieutenant governor and a former state lawmaker also challenged subpoenas. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who's overseeing the special grand jury, declined to quash the subpoenas but did set guidelines for the questions they could be asked based on their status as members of the General Assembly.","A judge in New York has mandated Rudy Giuliani's testimony before a special grand jury in Atlanta that is inquiring into the circumstances surrounding activities during the 2020 general election in Georgia.

On July 13, New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber issued an order for Giuliani, an attorney for Trump and former mayor of New York City, to testify before the special grand jury on Aug. 9 and on subsequent dates as requested by the Atlanta court, as per documents filed in Fulton County Superior Court.

There was no immediate response from Giuliani's legal representation when approached for comment on the matter.

The investigation, spearheaded by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, commenced early last year, with a special grand jury endowed with subpoena power assembled in response to her application in May. Willis indicated in her letter for the grand jury request that the investigation was focused on examining ""any coordinated efforts that may have affected the 2020 elections in this state.""

This month, Willis filed petitions to require the testimonies of seven individuals associated with Trump, including Giuliani and U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, in front of the special grand jury.

As these individuals are not residents of Georgia, Willis had to engage in a legal procedure that involves seeking assistance from a judge in the state of residence to compel them to testify.

Giuliani was originally summoned to a New York courtroom on July 13 to argue against the issuance of a subpoena for his testimony in Atlanta. However, he did not attend the hearing, as noted by Farber in his order.

Willis updated the judge managing the special grand jury on Wednesday about Giuliani’s receipt of Farber's directive to appear for testimony.

Giuliani may consider lodging a motion in the Atlanta court to contest the subpoena.

Graham, who has formally denied engaging in any impropriety, came to an understanding with Willis that any legal objections he may have to the subpoena will be pursued in the appropriate courts in Georgia.

U.S. Rep. Jody Hice has petitioned against his subpoena in a federal court in Atlanta, arguing that his post-election conduct falls within the scope of his congressional duties and thus is protected from legal scrutiny. A judge is due to consider this argument soon.

Subpoenas issued to Georgia's lieutenant governor and a former state legislator have been contested as well; however, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney upheld the subpoenas, specifying the bounds of questioning permitted given their legislative roles.","The language used in the article does not overtly suggest a particular ideological bias or viewpoint. The article presents facts and details regarding legal proceedings without inserting subjective commentary or emotive language that might indicate a political ideology. However, there are subtle elements of the text that may hint at certain narrative framing:

1. ""investigating claims that former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere"" - The term ""illegally tried to interfere"" indicates an ongoing investigation into potentially criminal conduct relating to President Trump and associates. This description is fact-based, reflecting the legal pursuit, and does not necessarily indicate bias.

2. ""a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request."" - Mentioning ""subpoena power"" illustrates the seriousness and authority of the investigation, which could lead readers to acknowledge the legitimacy and potential legal consequences of the proceedings, without necessarily signaling ideological leanings.

3. ""She said her team was looking into 'any coordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state.'"" - When quoting the district attorney's concern with ""unlawfully alter[ing] the outcome,"" the article reinforces the gravity of the allegations without rendering a subjective judgment.

4. ""Because they don't live in Georgia, she had to use a process..."" – This segment simply explains procedural aspects of the legal system without bias toward any political viewpoint.

5. ""Giuliani had been summoned to appear in court...but he failed to show up for the hearing..."" – Noting Giuliani's failure to appear could evoke in some readers concerns about accountability or disregard for legal procedures, which might be viewed critically, but within the article's context, it reports on factual events without added commentary or suggestion of wrongdoing.

6. ""Graham, who has denied any wrongdoing..."" – Including Senator Graham's denial is an example of balanced reporting, which provides his perspective, maintaining neutrality and avoiding unsupported character judgments.

7. ""Hice filed a challenge to a subpoena issued for his testimony..."" - This narrative mentions legal defense actions without commenting on their validity or motivations, sticking to procedural aspects of the case.

8. ""declined to quash the subpoenas but did set guidelines"" – The judge's actions are reported factually with emphasis on the legal limitations and conditions he set, not hinting at any ideological position.

Overall, the article maintains a neutral and fact-based tone throughout and seems to focus on delivering the procedural steps and current status of the investigation without embedding it in a particular political ideology."
newsmax,Election,"One of the nation's biggest battleground states could be in line for a registration makeover.

According to Reuters, an updated data review reveals that Republicans in Pennsylvania are registering former Democrats at four times the rate of the reverse process (Republicans turning Democratic).

This substantive switch has become a ""warning sign for Democrats,"" as they fight to hold the congressional majority in the Keystone State.

The Reuters report adds more credence to speculation of the Republicans tipping the proverbial scales in the November midterm elections, perhaps reclaiming the national majority in the House and Senate chambers.

The data from the report also suggests the Pennsylvania GOP is on track for the ""highest conversion rate in at least a decade and well above 2016, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives, and Senate.""

According to Breitbart News, Democrats still maintain a registered voter advantage in Pennsylvania — 4 million Democrats to 3.4 million Republicans (as of March 28). It represents, however, the Democrats' smallest lead in the state since 2005.

Along those lines, Florida and Nevada are posting similarly fruitful registration rates among new Republicans, coinciding with the Democrats' decline in the two states.

The Congressional Leadership Fund, the House Republican-aligned group that supports its members and policies, has been quick to trumpet the uptick in registration rolls with the GOP in Pennsylvania. This affiliation surge might leave formerly entrenched Democrats, such as Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., vulnerable come November.

""Voters are looking elsewhere for leadership because Susan Wild's and Democrats' toxic agenda has made life more difficult than ever for Pennsylvania families,"" said CLF press secretary Cally Perkins.

Citing Ballotpedia, the last two presidential elections in Pennsylvania were decided by less than 2 percentage points.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden topped Republican Donald Trump by a margin of 1.2 percentage point. Four years earlier, Trump best Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton by a 0.7 percentage-point margin.

This year's U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania could produce a number of twists and turns, now that incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has opted not to run for reelection.

On the GOP side, a Real Clear Politics poll has David McCormick leading TV star Mehmet Oz in four of five primary tracking polls.
• Sources Say Pro-Impeachment Rep. Upton Chose to Quit Rather Than Lose","Recent voter registration trends in Pennsylvania are showing a notable increase in the number of former Democrats changing their party affiliation to Republican. Statistics indicate that this shift is occurring at four times the rate of Republicans who are becoming Democrats.

The shift in voter registration comes as political parties are gearing up for congressional contests in the state, which often plays a pivotal role in national elections. These changes are part of a dynamic political landscape and could impact future election outcomes in Pennsylvania.

While the Republican Party appears to be gaining ground in terms of voter registration conversions, the Democratic Party still holds an overall lead in the number of registered voters in the state. The current figures show approximately 4 million registered Democrats compared to 3.4 million registered Republicans, as of late March, highlighting the smallest margin between the two major parties since 2005.

Similar trends are being observed in other states like Florida and Nevada, where an increase in Republican registration has been noted alongside a decrease in Democratic registrations.

Particular attention is being paid to certain legislators whose districts may be affected by the shifting political affiliations. Political groups aligned with the parties are analyzing these changes closely, with Republicans using the data to support their campaign strategies.

Recent elections in Pennsylvania have been closely contested. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020 by a margin of 1.2 percentage points, while former President Donald Trump won in 2016 by 0.7 percentage points. These narrow victories underscore the state's status as a competitive electoral battleground.

Looking ahead to upcoming elections, Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race is drawing interest following the announcement that incumbent Senator Pat Toomey will not be running for re-election. The developing primary races for both parties are being closely watched, with several candidates vying for the nomination.

This evolving political scene in Pennsylvania reflects a broader context of shifting allegiances and strategic party efforts, underscoring the complex and ever-changing nature of American electoral politics.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric of this article reveals a slant towards a conservative or Republican political ideology.

1. ""One of the nation's biggest battleground states could be in line for a registration makeover.""
   - This implies a significant change is happening, possibly favoring Republicans, due to the term ""makeover.""

2. ""According to Reuters, an updated data review reveals that Republicans in Pennsylvania are registering former Democrats at four times the rate of the reverse process (Republicans turning Democratic).""
   - The language here suggests a victory or strategic advantage for Republicans, presenting it as a noteworthy accomplishment.

3. ""This substantive switch has become a 'warning sign for Democrats,' as they fight to hold the congressional majority in the Keystone State.""
   - The phrase ""warning sign for Democrats"" indicates trouble for the Democratic Party, invoking a sense of impending loss and playing into the narrative of a weakened opposition.

4. ""...perhaps reclaiming the national majority in the House and Senate chambers.""
   - The word ""reclaiming"" suggests a righteous or inevitable return to power for Republicans, connoting a restoration of previous status.

5. ""The data from the report also suggests the Pennsylvania GOP is on track for the 'highest conversion rate in at least a decade and well above 2016, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives, and Senate.'""
   - By framing the statistic as impressive and connecting it to past Republican victories, the language elevates the GOP's performance and suggests a repeat of successful elections.

6. ""Democrats still maintain a registered voter advantage in Pennsylvania ... It represents, however, the Democrats' smallest lead in the state since 2005.""
   - Although this reports a current Democratic advantage, it's immediately qualified with a negative trend, which diminishes the positive aspect.

7. ""Voters are looking elsewhere for leadership because Susan Wild's and Democrats' toxic agenda has made life more difficult than ever for Pennsylvania families.""
   - The word ""toxic"" in reference to the Democrats' agenda portrays it as harmful and undesirable, revealing a strong partisan criticism and solidifying the Republican stance.

8. ""... the House Republican-aligned group that supports its members and policies, has been quick to trumpet the uptick in registration rolls with the GOP in Pennsylvania.""
   - The verb ""trumpet"" conveys a sense of pride and triumph, emphasizing Republican gains.

9. ""On the GOP side, a Real Clear Politics poll has David McCormick leading TV star Mehmet Oz in four of five primary tracking polls.""
   - The inclusion of this specific poll indicates a Republican focus, as it details the GOP primaries without comparable insight into the Democratic race, implying a presumed Republican primary is of greater interest or consequence.

10. ""• Sources Say Pro-Impeachment Rep. Upton Chose to Quit Rather Than Lose""
   - This subheading at the end is a standalone assertion without context, denoting a Republican-resistant action (impeachment) in a negative light, insinuating defeat and resignation rather than determination and resistance.

These points taken together suggest that the language of the article is presenting information with a Republican-leaning bias, highlighting the successes and momentum of the GOP while casting Democrats in a less favorable light."
newsmax,Immigration,"The Biden administration plans to launch an effort this week to make it easier for some Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of their country to come to the United States after only a handful of refugees were admitted in the first two weeks of March, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The initiative would speed up visa processing for relatives of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and detail more staff to handle applications for a temporary status known as ""humanitarian parole,"" one of the people said. The measures would be included under a series of efforts to help Ukrainians trying to get to the United States through existing legal immigration pathways.

The administration is particularly focused on LGBTQ individuals, activists, journalists and other potentially vulnerable groups, said the sources, all of whom requested anonymity to discuss internal plans.

It is unclear how many people could be helped under the new U.S. measures. Lawmakers and advocacy groups have urged the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden to do more to help Ukrainians who want to seek refuge in the United States.

More than 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded that country Feb. 24, according to the United Nations refugee agency, the fastest-moving refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War Two.

But only seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States from March 1-16, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows, as the war intensified and the number of Ukrainians fleeing skyrocketed.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a briefing Tuesday that the administration is taking ""a very close look"" at how to ease Ukrainian family reunifications, but did not provide more details. Last week, another State Department spokesperson said refugee processing in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv had been ""severely impacted"" by the conflict.

The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Biden officials have said the majority of the people fleeing Ukraine will want to remain in Europe, where they can travel without a visa and may have family and friends.

According to State Department data, the United States admitted 514 Ukrainian refugees in January and February during Russia's build-up to the war, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" instead of an invasion.

The Biden administration has said refugees should not try to apply for U.S. tourist visas, which are intended for short stays.

Some Ukrainians have instead traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to ask for asylum at border checkpoints. Several interviewed by Reuters last week were allowed to enter and given one-year humanitarian parole status.

Ukrainians abroad can also apply for humanitarian parole, which allows people to enter the United States on an emergency basis even if they lack a legal visa. But the program faces a steep backlog of tens of thousands of applications already from Afghans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and others seeking refuge.","The Biden administration is expected to introduce new measures this week aimed at assisting Ukrainians who are seeking refuge in the United States due to the ongoing conflict in their home country. These actions include streamlining the visa processing for family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and increasing staff to manage applications for ""humanitarian parole,"" a form of temporary legal status in emergency situations.

This initiative is part of a broader effort to support those seeking to navigate the U.S. immigration system under established legal channels. The move comes amidst the rapidly increasing number of individuals who have been displaced by the conflict, with more than 3.5 million people having left Ukraine since hostilities began, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

Despite the scale of the crisis, there has been a low number of Ukrainian refugees admitted to the United States in the early part of March. U.S. State Department data reveals that only seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled between March 1-16, highlighting the potential need for more efficient processing.

The U.S. State Department has acknowledged the challenges faced in family reunifications and has indicated a close examination of possible solutions. Still, no further details have been provided yet. Operations at the U.S. embassy in Kyiv have been significantly affected by the conflict.

Questions directed to the White House about these plans were referred to the Department of Homeland Security, which has not offered a comment at the time of reporting.

Officials have noted that the majority of those fleeing Ukraine may prefer to stay in Europe due to ease of travel without a visa and existing family and social connections there. Prior to the intensified conflict, the United States had admitted a number of Ukrainian refugees, with State Department data showing 514 admitted in January and February.

The Biden administration has advised against using U.S. tourist visas, which are meant for brief visits, as a means for seeking refuge. Some individuals from Ukraine, however, have made their way to the U.S.-Mexico border to request asylum at checkpoints. Those interviewed were permitted to enter on a one-year humanitarian parole status.

Additionally, Ukrainians in other regions can apply for humanitarian parole, a measure allowing entry to the United States during urgent situations, even when applicants don't possess the required legal visas. It's worth noting that there is currently a substantial backlog of applications for this status, not only from Ukrainians but also from individuals from Afghanistan and other locations seeking safety.","The article seems to maintain a relatively neutral tone and appears to report on the situation without overt political commentary. However, there are some phrases and language choices that could subtly indicate underlying political perspectives or ideologies:

1. **""...plans to launch an effort this week to make it easier for some Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of their country to come to the United States...""**
   - The phrase ""Russian invasion"" is a clear and unambiguous term that aligns with the general Western perspective that opposes Russia's actions in Ukraine. The term 'invasion' has strong negative connotations, suggesting an unsanctioned and aggressive breach of sovereignty.

2. **""The administration is particularly focused on LGBTQ individuals, activists, journalists, and other potentially vulnerable groups...""**
   - This sentence reflects an ideology that prioritizes the protection of minority and at-risk groups, which is typically associated with more liberal or progressive platforms. By specifically mentioning LGBTQ individuals, activists, and journalists, it implies a commitment to human rights and the protection of freedom of expression, which aligns with a liberal democratic viewpoint.

3. **""Lawmakers and advocacy groups have urged the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden to do more to help Ukrainians who want to seek refuge in the United States.""**
   - The explicit mention of President Joe Biden's political affiliation (Democratic) may suggest an awareness of partisan perspectives on immigration and refugee assistance. The inclusion of ""lawmakers and advocacy groups"" as urging for more action can imply support for a proactive humanitarian response, a stance often associated with liberal politics.

4. **""According to the United Nations refugee agency, the fastest-moving refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War Two.""**
   - The presentation of the refugee crisis as the ""fastest-moving"" since World War Two contextualizes the situation in a historically significant way, potentially designed to evoke a sense of urgency and compel a strong humanitarian response. This approach may resonate with ideologies that emphasize international cooperation and aid in times of crisis.

5. **""...which the Kremlin calls a 'special military operation' instead of an invasion.""**
   - By pointing out the Kremlin's terminology and contrasting it with the commonly accepted term ""invasion,"" the article subtly criticizes the Russian government's attempt to frame the conflict in a more neutral or justified light. This contrast may imply support for the international consensus that opposes the action taken by Russia and rejects the euphemistic language.

6. **""But the program faces a steep backlog of tens of thousands of applications already from Afghans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and others seeking refuge.""**
   - The mention of a backlog of applicants fleeing Taliban-controlled Afghanistan aligns with a viewpoint sympathetic to refugees and critical of bureaucratic hurdles that delay the protection of vulnerable populations. This perspective likely aligns with ideologies that advocate for refugee rights and streamlined humanitarian responses.

In summary, while the article itself does not overtly express or advocate for a particular political ideology, the language used includes terms and context that align with a more liberal or progressive stance, particularly in regards to human rights, refugee support, and opposition to aggressive military actions by sovereign states."
newsmax,Immigration,"The FBI has raided the home of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, amid a federal investigation into the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and its ties to U.S. businessmen, according to ABC News.

Cuellar, a Democrat, has been heavily critical of the Biden administration's handling of conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border in west Texas, where his district lies.

Any raid on Cuellar's home was ""court-authorized,"" an FBI spokesman told ABC News.

A source told ABC News it is not known if Cuellar is a target of the investigation.

Cuellar said in a statement he ""will fully cooperate in any investigation"" and that he is ""committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.""

Cuellar has been a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and has met with Azerbaijan officials, including Azerbaijan Ambassador Elin Suleymanov, according to the report.

The Texas news site myRGV.com reported that more than a dozen agents visited Cuellar's home in Laredo, near the Mexican border, and were seen taking ""cases and other items"" from his home.

Reporter Valerie Gonzalez posted a photo on Twitter of two men in FBI T-shirts approaching a salmon-colored house. Gonzalez said agents had also visited Cuellar's campaign office on Wednesday afternoon.

Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, represents a Texas district that hugs the banks of the Rio Grande, just opposite Mexico. He is facing a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer.

Information from Reuters was used in this report.","The FBI has executed a search warrant at the home of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, as part of a federal investigation related to the nation of Azerbaijan and its connections with American business interests, ABC News reports.

Cuellar has expressed disagreements with the current administration's approach to border management in the region of south Texas where he represents.

An FBI spokesperson has confirmed to ABC News that the search was carried out with appropriate legal authorization.

According to ABC News, it has not been confirmed whether Cuellar is directly implicated in the investigation.

In a formal statement, Cuellar has indicated his intention to cooperate with any investigative efforts and emphasized his commitment to the principles of justice and law adherence.

In his role, Cuellar has served as a co-chair for the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus and has engaged with officials from Azerbaijan, including meetings with Azerbaijan Ambassador Elin Suleymanov.

Local Texas media outlet myRGV.com reported that a group of agents were seen at Cuellar's residence in Laredo, which is located adjacent to the Mexican border, removing several items and containers from the property.

Journalist Valerie Gonzalez shared an image on Twitter showing FBI personnel at what appeared to be Cuellar's house. Additionally, Gonzalez noted that Cuellar's campaign office was also visited by agents.

Representing a district that spans along the Rio Grande across from Mexico, Cuellar is known for having a voting record on some issues that diverge from the mainstream of his party. He is presently competing in his party's primary, with lawyer Jessica Cisneros challenging him for the nomination.

This information includes content supplied by Reuters.","Analyzing the language and rhetoric in this article reveals subtle cues about its political ideology. Here are specific examples:

1. ""The FBI has raided the home of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas...""
   - The word ""raided"" carries a connotation of a sudden and forceful action, which can imply wrongdoing or suspicion. However, in this context, it's a factual description of the FBI's actions and doesn't immediately reveal bias.

2. ""Cuellar, a Democrat, has been heavily critical of the Biden administration...""
   - The phrase ""heavily critical"" suggests a significant dissent from party lines, which can imply the congressman's independent stance or a rift within the party. It may also indicate that the article is giving space to internal party dynamics, but still does not explicitly suggest a bias.

3. ""Any raid on Cuellar's home was 'court-authorized,' an FBI spokesman told ABC News.""
   - By including the term ""court-authorized,"" the article provides a legitimacy to the FBI's actions, which neutralizes potential accusations of overreach or partisanship associated with the raid.

4. ""Cuellar said in a statement he 'will fully cooperate in any investigation'...""
   - This direct quote from Cuellar portrays him as compliant and transparent, which casts him in a cooperative light during a federal investigation.

5. ""Cuellar has been a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus...""
   - The mention of his role with the Azerbaijan Caucus is factual, though it might implicitly connect him with the investigation's focus on ""Azerbaijan and its ties to U.S. businessmen,"" hinting at potential entanglement without direct accusation.

6. ""...were seen taking 'cases and other items' from his home.""
   - This description paints a scene of evidence collection. It can lead readers to imagine a thorough and perhaps incriminating scenario, although no direct accusation is made.

7. ""Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives...""
   - Labeling Cuellar as ""one of the most conservative Democrats"" underscores his ideological leanings, potentially appealing to readers from across the political spectrum or signaling an outlier within the Democratic Party.

8. ""He is facing a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer.""
   - This concludes the article with an anticipation of political contest, setting up a dichotomy between Cuellar and his challenger. Mentioning that Cisneros is an ""immigration lawyer"" could evoke themes of border policy and humanitarian interests, which are particularly salient in their district.

Overall, the ideological bias of the article is not overtly expressed through extreme or polarizing language. Instead, the article sticks to a more neutral presentation of facts, with subtle cues that may suggest a nuanced perspective on Democratic Party politics and the investigation's potential impacts on Rep. Cuellar's career. The use of quotes and careful framing around factual statements allows the article to maintain an objective tone while still acknowledging party dynamics and the context of the investigation."
newsmax,Police,"An attorney with close ties to the Oath Keepers was arrested Thursday and charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to federal prosecutors.

Kellye SoRelle, 43, was charged on four counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of justice, obstruction of an official proceeding – i.e. certification of the 2020 Electoral College results -- and entering restricted grounds, according to papers filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

SoRelle was arrested in Junction, Texas, following an indictment in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, CNN reported. She was expected to appear in court in Austin, Texas, later Thursday.

The lawyer was photographed with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes outside of the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, CNN said.

Rhodes and several members of the Oath Keepers are charged with seditious conspiracy. Their trial is set to begin Sept. 27.

SoRelle's connections to the Oath Keepers have appeared in court filings, including regarding a 2020 virtual meeting a week after the presidential election. The court records said that Oath Keepers talked about traveling to Washington in the meeting.

According to prosecutors, Rhodes had warned his group to prepare for a ""bloody and desperate fight"" in the days leading up to the Capitol assault.

In May, an Oath Keepers member admitted to engaging in seditious conspiracy during the Capitol attack.

William Todd Wilson, of North Carolina, pleaded guilty during a federal court hearing in Washington. He was the third Oath Keepers defendant to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy and obstruction charges.

SoRelle in May told CNN that she had been cooperating with the Justice Department.

""I've done interviews. I've done everything. I'm helping them,"" SoRelle said, adding that she also handed over phones to investigators.

SoRelle does not represent any Oath Keepers in their criminal proceedings, CNN said.","An attorney was apprehended on Thursday for her alleged involvement in the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, federal prosecutors reported.

Kellye SoRelle, age 43, faces charges including conspiracy, obstruction of an official proceeding – the certification of the 2020 Electoral College results – and entry onto restricted grounds, according to documents submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

The arrest of SoRelle took place in Junction, Texas, subsequent to an indictment from Washington, D.C. on the preceding Wednesday, as reported by CNN. She was scheduled for a court appearance in Austin, Texas on the same Thursday.

SoRelle was present outside of the Capitol with the leader of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, during the January 6 events, as shown in photos aired by CNN.

The trial for Rhodes and other Oath Keepers members, who face seditious conspiracy charges, is due to commence on September 27.

Court documents reference SoRelle's association with the Oath Keepers, mentioning texts about a 2020 virtual meeting that occurred one week following the presidential election. According to these documents, the group discussed plans for traveling to Washington.

In the period leading up to the January 6 events, Rhodes reportedly urged his group members to be ready for a challenging fight, as per the prosecution's statements.

By May, a member of the Oath Keepers, William Todd Wilson of North Carolina, entered a plea of guilty for seditious conspiracy during a hearing in a federal court in Washington. Wilson is the third defendant of the Oath Keepers to admit to such charges.

SoRelle, in an interview with CNN in May, indicated that she had been working with the Justice Department. She mentioned conducting interviews and surrendering her phones to investigating authorities.

CNN reported that SoRelle is not acting as a legal representative for any members of the Oath Keepers in their criminal cases.","This article appears to present information in a straightforward, factual manner, without overt ideological language or rhetoric. However, there are subtle cues that might suggest an undercurrent of a particular viewpoint:

1. ""An attorney with close ties to the Oath Keepers was arrested..."" 
   - This phrase establishes a connection between the attorney and the Oath Keepers, which in the context of the article is a group associated with criminal charges. The phrase ""close ties"" implies association, but not necessarily wrongdoing on the part of the attorney based on that association alone. 

2. ""...attack on the U.S. Capitol...""
   - The use of the word ""attack"" to describe the events of January 6 suggests a view of the incident as aggressive and violent, which aligns with a perspective that is critical of the actions that took place that day.

3. ""SoRelle was arrested in Junction, Texas...""
   - The mere presentation of the arrest as a fact does not indicate bias, but the lack of any defensive context or alternative viewpoint (e.g., comments from the attorney or her representatives) might imply a focus on the prosecutorial side of the story.

4. ""Rhodes and several members of the Oath Keepers are charged with seditious conspiracy.""
   - By stating that the charges are for ""seditious conspiracy,"" the article aligns with the legal framing provided by the prosecutors. This term carries a connotation of betrayal or threats against the government, which suggests a serious wrongdoing.

5. ""SoRelle's connections to the Oath Keepers have appeared in court filings...""
   - The fact that her connections ""have appeared in court filings"" further emphasizes the legal troubles associated with the Oath Keepers, reinforcing the view of the group as involved in criminal proceedings.

6. ""According to prosecutors, Rhodes had warned his group to prepare for a 'bloody and desperate fight'...""
   - Using this quote from prosecutors highlights the violent rhetoric associated with the Oath Keepers' leadership, supporting an interpretation of the group as extreme or radical.

7. ""In May, an Oath Keepers member admitted to engaging in seditious conspiracy during the Capitol attack.""
   - Here, the article references a plea of guilt from a member of the Oath Keepers, which adds credibility to the charged offenses and underscores the gravity of the group's actions.

8. ""SoRelle told CNN that she had been cooperating with the Justice Department.""
   - This final statement gives a voice to the attorney, suggesting compliance with the investigation. It indicates a willingness to cooperate, potentially softening the reader's view of the individual compared to the group she is associated with.

Overall, the political ideology is not overtly present but the article does seem to take the perspective that aligns with law enforcement and the prosecution, presenting the facts in a way that supports the legitimacy of the charges against the Oath Keepers and related individuals."
newsmax,Police,"The Las Vegas Sun on Wednesday updated an editorial about the apparent Black Lives Matter activist's shooting of a mayoral candidate in which it discussed ''a rise in threats against politicians fueled by increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans,'' according to Fox News.

The incident happened in Louisville, Kentucky, where Quintez Brown, a BLM activist who was involved in protests after city police officers killed Breonna Taylor during a botched drug raid in her apartment in March 2020, is accused of shooting Craig Greenberg at his campaign office Monday.

Greenberg, a Democrat, was unharmed. Brown was charged with attempted murder and four counts of wanton endangerment, a police spokeswoman said.

''When we greeted him, he pulled out a gun, aimed directly at me and began shooting,'' Greenberg said at a news conference.

The Sun's editorial, ''Escalating hateful rhetoric leads nation down a dark, chaotic path,'' initially read: ''While there's been no indication yet that the activist had ties to any right-wing organizations, the shooting comes amid a rise in threats against politicians fueled by increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans.''

The updated piece reads: ''While it's been reported that the activist was involved in the Black Lives Matter and gun-safety movements and there has been no indication yet that he had ties to any right-wing organizations, the shooting comes amid a rise in threats against politicians fueled by increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans.''

The outlet does not intend to change the language again.

''We did not contend the shooter was associated with Republicans or right wing or was responding directly to right wing calls to violence,'' Bob Cauthorn, the outlet's chief operating officer, told the Daily Caller.

''We made that clear in all versions of the editorial. And our point about the way the rhetoric being used by some right wing extremists and some Republicans contributes to an environment in America where acts of political violence become more likely still stands.''","The Las Vegas Sun recently updated an editorial that covered an incident regarding a shooting of a mayoral candidate. The editorial examined the broader context of an increase in threats against politicians.

The event took place in Louisville, Kentucky, where Quintez Brown is accused of opening fire at Craig Greenberg's campaign office. Greenberg, who is running for mayor and is a member of the Democratic Party, was not injured in the incident. Brown, who participated in protests after a locally high-profile police shooting, has been charged with attempted murder and four counts of wanton endangerment, according to the authorities.

At a news conference, Greenberg described the harrowing moment: ""When we greeted him, he pulled out a gun, aimed directly at me and began shooting.""

The editorial titled, ""Escalating rhetoric leads nation down a dark, chaotic path,"" addressed concerns about heightened tensions in the political arena. The updated version states: ""While it's been reported that the activist was involved in movements and there has been no indication yet of his ties to specific political organizations, the incident occurs at a time when there is an uptick in threats against politicians.""

The publication has conveyed that it does not plan to revise the language further.

""We did not contend the shooter was associated with any political group or responding directly to calls to violence from any political faction,"" Bob Cauthorn, the Sun's chief operating officer, clarified. ""We made that clear in all versions of the editorial. And our point about the rhetoric being used by some extremists contributes to an environment in America where acts of political violence become more likely still stands.""","Based on the provided article, here are several instances where language and rhetoric suggest an underlying political ideology:

1. Use of ""extremist Republicans""
   - Context: Referring to the ""increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans""
   - Ideological Indication: The specific focus on ""extremist Republicans"" implies a view that blames a particular subset of right-wing politics for fostering a climate of political violence. It suggests a bias against a faction within the Republican Party, indicating a left-leaning or anti-Republican viewpoint.

2. Description ""hateful rhetoric""
   - Context: In the title of the Sun's editorial, ""Escalating hateful rhetoric leads nation down a dark, chaotic path""
   - Ideological Indication: The phrase ""hateful rhetoric"" is often associated with critiques of inflammatory or divisive speech. This implies condemnation of the language used by some political groups and again seems directed at certain factions, potentially right-leaning, accused of contributing to a divisive political climate, indicating a bias towards promoting civil discourse.

3. Mention of ""rise in threats against politicians""
   - Context: Linked to the ""increasingly violent rhetoric"" without immediate specification of the affiliations of those making threats
   - Ideological Indication: While it is a factual statement, placing it in the context of ""increasingly violent rhetoric from extremist Republicans"" indirectly connects the threat against politicians to one political group. This can suggest the belief that the right wing is responsible for an increase in political violence, indicating a left-leaning bias.

4. Characterization ""Black Lives Matter and gun-safety movements""
   - Context: Describing the affiliations of Quintez Brown, the accused shooter
   - Ideological Indication: The mention of Brown's involvement in ""Black Lives Matter and gun-safety movements"" could suggest the editorial's stance is sympathetic to these movements, which are typically associated with left-wing activism, indicating a left-leaning political viewpoint.

5. Explanation from Bob Cauthorn
   - Context: The outlet's COO responds to the article's implications about the shooter's affiliations.
   - Ideological Indication: Cauthorn's defense that the editorial did not tie the shooter to right-wing violence, while maintaining the stance on the environment fostered by ""right-wing extremists,"" shows an attempt to balance the publication against allegations of bias. However, the continued emphasis on right-wing rhetoric may still reflect an underlying left-leaning bias.

In summary, by focusing on ""extremist Republicans"" and ""hateful rhetoric"" while bringing up the rise in threats against politicians and connecting these elements, the article suggests an ideological standpoint that is critical of the political right and may reflect a left-leaning perspective on political violence and discourse in the United States."
