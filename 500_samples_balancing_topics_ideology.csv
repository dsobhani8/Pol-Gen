The people who want to legislate abortion and regulate the matter say that they are pro-life. But they are only talking about the life of the baby before it's born, and not about the life of the baby after it's born. The same people who want to regulate abortion want to defund schools.

bbc,Abortion,14,bbc,"A draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito said the majority of the court's judges favoured overturning the ruling known as Roe v Wade which in 1973 established a woman's right to an abortion.

What will happen if Roe v Wade is overturned?

Instead it would be up to each state to decide how much access women living there would have to abortion.

But other states will continue to provide access, not just for women in their state but for those living in states where it will be banned.

There are 13 states that have so-called trigger laws in place, which would lead to an immediate ban if the Supreme Court rules to overturn Roe v Wade.

Another dozen or so may move quickly to ban or severely limit access, says the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice group. It estimates 36 million women of reproductive age would live in states without abortion access.

These states are mostly in the south and west, which means some women may have to travel long distances to find a clinic.

What does the US public think about Roe v Wade?

A majority of Americans (62%) told Pew Research in 2019 that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Only 38% said it should be illegal in all or most cases.

In that poll, 62% of those asked said they wanted it kept in place and only 38% said they wanted it struck down.

Why is this all happening now?

That changed the political leaning of the court to one that was more sceptical about Roe v Wade and more supportive of restricting access to abortions.

bbc,COVID,50,bbc,"With the holiday season approaching in the US, doctors are urging people to exercise caution to avoid a surge in common and potentially dangerous winter viruses.

The US is facing a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with some hospitals opening extra beds to treat patients, while there are concerns about other illnesses such as flu.

Winnie Chow, a parent to 10-month-old Cooper, took her son to hospital earlier this month after he had been vomiting and coughing for several days. He spent four days there recovering from RSV.

""I was in tears,"" said Ms Chow, who lives in Hackensack, New Jersey. ""For him to be there for more than a day was very scary.""

Ms Chow is one of many parents who have had to seek care for an unwell child as winter viruses arrive earlier and with more severity than in recent years - a trend experts say could persist as people gather indoors for the winter holidays.

""When you have multiple generations mingling together, you have an increased risk of transmission from someone who is handling the virus pretty well to someone who may not handle it well at all.""

What is RSV and what are the symptoms?

Symptoms include a cough, congestion, runny nose and fever as well as wheezing in young infants, according to Rachel Orscheln, the director of ambulatory paediatric infectious diseases at St Louis Children's Hospital.

For the most vulnerable, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, a condition that includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.

It can be difficult to distinguish between RSV, coronavirus and the flu because the respiratory viruses include many of the same symptoms and usually peak in winter.

Parents should reach out to their child's healthcare provider if they begin to have concerns, especially if they are experiencing worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing or are struggling to drink fluids, said Sonali Advani, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University's Division of Infectious Diseases.

Why are RSV and flu cases rising?

Experts say protective measures like social distancing, mask wearing and other hygiene practices from the coronavirus pandemic likely shielded some children from exposure to the flu and their first RSV infection, which most children normally experience by age two.

An earlier RSV season followed by more severe flu infections has created a ""perfect storm"" that is ""flooding our paediatric capacity"", said Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts.

He told the BBC a reduction in hospital beds for children during the coronavirus pandemic, which was intended to make space for adults who are more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid, had worsened the current problem.

Some experts said they were not optimistic the issues would resolve soon, as close contact during the the winter holiday season could offer more opportunities for viral transmission.

Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection against some of the respiratory illnesses that are circulating, experts told the BBC.

US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was ""well matched"" to the circulating strain, while White House Covid co-ordinator Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to ""make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table"".

He added that parents could also make sure any person serving food during large family gatherings is symptom-free and handling the food in a hygienic manner.",COVID

bbc,Immigration,4,bbc,"When he took office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden declared that his ascension was the ""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy"".

Speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic, just weeks after the Capitol riot, he vowed to bring back unity and do ""great things"".

""We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus,"" he said.

A year into his presidency, we take a look at what progress Mr Biden has made, his standing with the American public, and what it all means for the president going forward, with analysis from the BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.

How are his approval ratings?

Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance, according to RealClearPolitics, and having won more than 80 million votes - more than any other president.

His star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and as the Delta variant advanced.

Since then, his approval ratings have fallen further as he has struggled to deliver on his biggest campaign promises to tame the pandemic and restore prosperity for working families.

Compared with other recent presidents, only Donald Trump has had a more disappointing first year - his approval rating fell from 45% on his inauguration day to 35% a year later, according to historical trends by Gallup.

Mr Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, began at a high of nearly 70% when he took office and ended close to 50% a year later. George W Bush began his first term in a similar position to Mr Biden, with approval around 60%, but that rose to nearly 90% after 9/11.

Anthony Zurcher: It's hard to say that the honeymoon is over for Joe Biden because he never really had one. His ratings started modestly positive, without the kind of big inaugural bump most presidents (not named Donald Trump) receive. Now his numbers are in the danger zone for first-term presidents hoping to win re-election - a reflection of near universal Republican dislike and a majority of independents who are souring on him.

Has he got the pandemic under control?

President Biden, who says he carries a card in his pocket with the number of Americans killed by the virus, has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his top priority.

In his first year, he has expanded vaccine availability and currently, about 75% of the US has had at least one dose, and 63% are fully vaccinated. Children as young as 5 have been eligible for the vaccine since November, 80 million booster doses have been administered to help protect against Omicron, and free at-home rapid tests have just become available to order this week.

But the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over. Over the course of the year, the US has undergone three major waves of the virus, and more than 850,000 Americans have died from Covid - the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden declared in a July speech that the US could celebrate ""independence"" from the Covid-19 pandemic. That may sit next to George W Bush's Iraq War ""mission accomplished"" banner in the hall of premature presidential victory declarations. While the White House will get credit for enacting a massive pandemic relief bill in May, its inability to prepare for the challenges presented by the Delta and Omicron variants have turned what seemed like looming success into a long, hard slog.

How has the US economy fared under his watch?

For many Americans, the number one issue facing the country is the economy. When Mr Biden took office, the pandemic had slowed job growth and the US had faced unemployment woes due to lockdown.

Employment rebounded somewhat over the last year, with 6.4 million jobs added. Though total employment remains lower than its pre-pandemic level, jobless claims have dropped to a near 50-year low.

Millions of Americans have quit their jobs. Though this shows confidence in the job market, some industries now face a labour shortage, contributing to global supply-chain problems and fuelling rocketing inflation.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden took office as the US economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns. The good news for him was falling unemployment, a booming stock market and record-setting growth. The bad news is that the velocity of the rebound led to supply-chain struggles and inflation levels not seen in decades. If the economy can shake those negative aspects off, his record will look good - but the problems have not been as ""transitory"" as the administration promised.

Has he delivered on immigration reforms?

One of Mr Biden's promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border, a Trump-era policy that angered the left.

The president kept his word on ending the so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy, and the number of minors held in detention centres has plummeted.

But since he took office, the US has seen an influx of migrants that has created new challenges. In 2021, there were almost 2 million encounters between migrants and US border officers, including 165,000 involving minors.

Long-term reforms remain elusive. Mr Biden's plan to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US has stalled in Congress, and he failed to overturn a Trump-era policy that made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard in the US.

Meanwhile, he has defended the use of a Trump policy that lets the government automatically expel undocumented asylum seekers in order to stop the spread of Covid-19. He used the so-called Title 42 policy to kick 4,000 Haitians out of Texas, drawing widespread condemnation.

Anthony Zurcher: There was always going to be an uptick in undocumented border crossings after the pandemic depressed migration levels for much of 2020. What was somewhat unexpected was that Mr Biden's immigration reforms - the ones he delivered on - super-charged the migratory crisis, swamping US border facilities unprepared for the surge. The result is that few people have been satisfied with the outcomes.

What are his accomplishments?

Despite opposition from Republicans and a fractured Democratic caucus, he managed to pass a $1tn infrastructure bill in November.

A longer term accomplishment may be his prolific appointment of judges - he has named more in his first year than any president since Ronald Reagan.

However, Mr Biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn't help him push his voting reforms through Congress. It wasn't the first time. Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, moderate Democrats in key swing states, have also held back his social-spending bill and climate agenda.

Anthony Zurcher: A lot of the focus over the past year has been on what Mr Biden hasn't accomplished in Congress versus what his administration has succeeded in pushing through. As any parent knows, making a promise you can't keep is a great way to provoke a temper tantrum. Mr Biden spread a lot of promises out on the campaign trail, some of which were unrealistic or depended on circumstances beyond his control. Now he's facing an electorate whose temper is starting to flare.",Immigration
bbc,Immigration,6,bbc,"Russia previously seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine in 2014. Ever since, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in areas near the border. The conflict has claimed 14,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes.

After discussions in Berlin with British, French and German officials on Thursday, Mr Blinken said that allowing a Russian incursion into Ukraine would ""drag us all back to a much more dangerous and unstable time, when this continent, and this city, were divided in two... with the threat of all-out war hanging over everyone's heads"".

What do the US and Russia want from these talks?

It's highly possible that Mr Blinken and Mr Lavrov will emerge from the talks, which are expected to last about two hours, with differing accounts of what took place.

For its part, the Kremlin says the diplomats will take stock of talks so far on the Ukraine crisis, and that Russia is not expecting the US to provide a formal response to its proposals.

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday that ties with the US are nearing a ""dangerous critical line"", according to Russia's Interfax news agency. He said Moscow hoped to persuade Washington to change its approach.

Mr Blinken could offer Russia more transparency on military exercises in the region, or suggest reviving restrictions on missiles in Europe. These rules were previously set out in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era pact that the US scrapped in 2019, after accusing Russia of violating the deal.

Russia maintains that Ukraine is its primary focus. On Thursday it unveiled plans for naval drills involving more than 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, seen as a show of strength.

The same day, the US warned that Russian intelligence officers have been recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to step in as a provisional government and cooperate with an occupying Russian force in the event of an invasion.

The US Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two current Ukrainian members of parliament and two former government officials accused of being part of the plot.

How unified are the US and its allies?

President Biden was heavily criticised for comments he made on Wednesday, when he bleakly predicted that Russia ""will move in"" on Ukraine, but appeared to suggest a ""minor incursion"" could attract a weaker response from the US and its allies.

The message provoked a rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted: ""There are no minor incursions. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones.""

Mr Biden sought to clear up the confusion - and apparent disconnect with Mr Blinken's tougher line - by saying any Russian troop movement across Ukraine's border would qualify as an invasion and that Moscow would ""pay a heavy price"".

Speaking alongside Mr Blinken, Germany's new Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pledged immediate action against any Russian invasion and did not rule out imposing measures that ""could have economic consequences for ourselves"".

The UK's Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has also called on Mr Putin to ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"" that would lead to terrible loss of life.

In a speech on Friday in Sydney, she urged Western powers to ""step up"" and warned that autocratic nations were being ""emboldened in a way we haven't seen since the cold war"".

bbc,Immigration,56,bbc,"At the end of a year in which motherhood has been at the centre of impassioned debate in the US, a school in Texas for teenage mothers shows how young lives are being supported - and reshaped.

But Helen had also been moody and would easily find herself picking fights with family and friends. Then her period was late.

Soon, her friends shunned her, accusing her of using her pregnancy to ""get guys"" and the father of her child, a classmate, stopped talking to her.

From the outside, Lincoln Park looks like any other US high school - sandy brick, school buses parked out front and the American flag flying in the breeze.

Teen birth rates in the US have declined in the last three decades, but among young Hispanic women, it remains much more common than for the rest of the population.

Latinas have the highest teen pregnancy rates of any group, and experts warn that following a 2022 Supreme Court decision to strike down the federal protection to abortion, the numbers are likely to rise.

Almost all of the students at Lincoln Park High, which has exclusively served teen mothers since 2005, are aged between 14 and 19. All of them are Latina - a reflection of the city's 94% Hispanic population as well as its higher rates of teen pregnancies. Most are low-income, and a few are American-born Mexican residents who cross the border daily from Matamoros, Tamaulipas to attend classes in the US.

In a year when motherhood has sat at the heart of America's cultural and political conversation, Lincoln Park offers a glimpse of how it shapes the lives of young women already facing the challenges of this unexpected and monumental life change.

'Now I have to think about me and my baby'

The thing that convinced Helen to switch to Lincoln Park was that she could take her baby to the school, she said.

Speaking to the BBC between classes this June, Helen still looked every inch the shy, dark-eyed teenager she was in her black T-shirt and pale pink shorts.

But in her backpack next to her books and journals were diapers and baby clothes for her daughter, Jenine, now eight months old.

""It used to just be me, now I have to think about me and my baby,"" she said.

Some 70 students are enrolled at the school, although that number seesaws throughout the year as newly pregnant students join, and some young mothers choose to return to their previous schools postpartum.

At the time of the BBC's visit to Lincoln Park, seven middle school students under the age of 14 were enrolled, as well as three students who each have three children.

The curriculum is exactly the same as that of other schools in the district, and students are still expected to pass their classes. But the differences are in the details.

The school buses that transport some of the students all have car seats for their babies. In the mornings, students can pick up breakfast for themselves and for their child. Their babies can attend the school daycare free-of-charge.

The students are allowed excused absences for their children's doctor's appointments. In one classroom, the science teacher has a tall wardrobe in the corner of the room with baby clothes for the mothers who might need them.

Alexis, like Helen, was 15 when she found out she was pregnant. She used three at-home pregnancy tests and they all came out positive. Still in denial, she saw a doctor, who confirmed she would be having a baby boy.

""It was so hard on me,"" Alexis said. ""I didn't want to drop out because I knew it wasn't the correct way to handle it.""

Inside the classrooms, there is a deep sense of camaraderie and intimacy that is almost shocking to an outsider, though clearly very natural to the students and staff.

Alexis and her classmates turned to face the door, as one student walked in late to class. Visibly nearing the end of her pregnancy, she walked slowly, with a slight waddle. The girls all smiled, and Alexis reached her arm out as her classmate got closer.

Mr Arredondo is the most inexperienced of the class in childbearing - at least in terms of first-hand experience. But he has taught enough pregnant students to know a thing or two.

""When the girls tell you that you're going to need an epidural, what do you think?"" he asked.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for every 1,000 young women between the ages of 15 to 19, 15 gave birth in the year 2020. The data does not include birth rates for teenagers below the age of 15.

Even with the overall national decline, Texas remains above the national average and is consistently on the top-10 of states with high teen birth rates.

There are a myriad of factors that play a role in teen pregnancy rates, but in Texas, some experts cite the state's strict abortion laws and the fact that sex education is not required in schools.

As many as 58% of Texas public schools teach abstinence-only sex education, and 25% do not teach it at all, according to the liberal Texas Freedom Network, a religious and community leaders' group.

""As long as we don't share that information with them, then they're not getting educated,"" said Cynthia Cardenas, the Lincoln Park High School principal. ""They're not given the opportunity to choose whether they want the consequence or not.""

Teenagers in Texas who do become pregnant must navigate a complex public health system to access care or otherwise face some of the strictest abortion laws in the country if they choose to terminate a pregnancy.

Travelling out of state to receive abortion care is often not an option for low-income women, especially when they are underage.

Helen had early on in her pregnancy considered abortion or giving her daughter up for adoption. Her mother said she would support whatever decision she took.

""My baby is the best thing that happened to me,"" Helen said. Jenine, an active infant cared for at the daycare, wears a big different coloured bow around her head each day that matches her outfit. ""I have the love of my life in my hands, she's everything for me,"" her mother said.

Helen is just a year away from graduating high school. She dreams about going to college and being able to provide for her daughter.

But in truth, only about half of teen mothers finish high school, and even fewer go on to pursue a higher degree, according to the CDC.

Planting the seed of going to college

The struggles of motherhood are hard, especially early on. Studies show that becoming a teenage mother is a risk factor for depression. Women who became pregnant as teens make up more than half of all mothers on welfare.

The stresses of poverty and youth facing the mums at Lincoln Park cause some to become disinterested in school, or to think it will be impossible to pursue further education with a child.

At lunchtime, Alexis and three other students take turns sharing photos of their young children. One had just started walking and another had got a new haircut.

Ms Cardenas, who joins the girls at lunch most days, walked over to the group. Since most are one year away from graduating, she asks them if they have taken their college entrance exams.

""I was already accepted into one school, but I don't think I want to go to college,"" said Angela, a US-born student living in Mexico. She crosses the border every day to come to Lincoln Park, pushing her baby in a stroller along the pedestrian bridge that separates Brownsville from Matamoros. Her days start at 5am when she queues up south of the border.

But Alexis interjects to tell Angela what she had learnt from a recent college information session. ""They have a daycare there and if your kids are quiet, your baby can go to class with you,"" Alexis said.

As much as the odds are stacked against them, one of the goals at Lincoln Park is to try to ""plant that seed of going to college"" for the students, said Ms Cardenas. ""And become successful and teach their babies that they also have a way"".

""They don't know how to raise a baby sometimes,"" Ms Cardenas said. ""We hold their futures in our hands as educators. We have to do this the right way.""

'Whatever you put in now, you will reap the rewards'

But in the back of her mind, she has been thinking about the need and support for schools like Lincoln Park amid the changing political and social landscape following the Supreme Court's abortion decision this summer.

The decision is expected to uniquely and disproportionately impact teens, according to Child Trends, a US research group focused on the welfare of children. Teens are more likely to seek abortions, learn of pregnancies later and struggle for support.

""I've been thinking about the implications of the reversal of Roe vs Wade,"" Ms Cardenas said, noting that Hispanic women are one of the largest groups of abortion-seekers in the US.

""My hopes are that we promote sex education in middle school and high school and that we, educators, create a plan of action that will be followed if we have more teens having babies as a result [of Roe being overturned],"" she said.

""Not a lot of school districts offer schools like this,"" she added. ""If you ask me, is it needed? Yes. Even if we can make a difference in 10 girls lives, yes. These are girls who wouldn't make it through a regular campus.""

Clear glass cases in the school's halls display smiling pictures of previous classes of students who graduated. Each week a local professional comes to present to the students as part of a career guest speaker series.

""What you're doing by coming to school, being a mother and having children, that's hard,"" one presenter, a young woman, tells them.

""Know that whatever you put in now, you will reap the rewards.""",Immigration
bbc,Immigration,54,bbc,"The Trump-era immigration policy known as Title 42 is back in the news once again, after the US Supreme Court halted its expiration, which was expected to occur on 21 December.

The policy has been a focus of criticism from immigration advocates and many Democrats, as they say it prevents asylum seekers from entering the US. Republicans and proponents of stricter immigration rules argue that it should remain in place to stop illegal border crossings, or that the country is not prepared for the end of the policy.

What is Title 42 and how is it being used for immigration?

In March 2020, the Trump administration invoked the statute with the stated intent of preventing Covid-19 from spreading in the US. The former president and his top advisers had also supported tightening and overhauling US immigration policy, and the president had run on a pledge to build a wall along the border with Mexico to keep migrants from entering the country.

The Biden administration continued to defend the policy for over a year after the current president took office, and expelled about two million people under Title 42 in fiscal years 2021-22, according to US Customs and Border Protection's data.

What was supposed to happen to Title 42 this week?

By the fall of 2021, the Biden administration began preparing for the end of Title 42, and in April, the Centers for Disease Control, which oversees US health policy, signalled it would lift the order. However, the end of the programme was delayed multiple times in 2022 because of court battles.

But two days before, the US Supreme Court's Chief Justice John Roberts issued a stay, meaning that for now, Title 42 would remain in effect until the Supreme Court reviews the lower court's ruling.

Democratic activists and lawmakers who support immigration have urged the Biden administration to end the order for two years now, and Title 42 became a major issue during the 2022 midterm elections.

But the debate doesn't neatly cleave along party lines. During the midterms, some Democratic lawmakers, wary of losing voters on the issue of immigration, urged the Biden administration to keep the order in place.

Members of both parties have also expressed concern that immigration officials at the border are not adequately prepared to handle the surge of migration that is expected to ensue when Title 42 ends. In April, a bipartisan group of US senators signed on to a bill that would have delayed the end of the policy.

What happens next with Title 42?",Immigration
bbc,Immigration,1,bbc,"When he took office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden declared that his ascension was the ""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy"".

Speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic, just weeks after the Capitol riot, he vowed to bring back unity and do ""great things"".

""We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus,"" he said.

A year into his presidency, we take a look at what progress Mr Biden has made, his standing with the American public, and what it all means for the president going forward, with analysis from the BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.

How are his approval ratings?

Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance, according to RealClearPolitics, and having won more than 80 million votes - more than any other president.

His star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and as the Delta variant advanced.

Since then, his approval ratings have fallen further as he has struggled to deliver on his biggest campaign promises to tame the pandemic and restore prosperity for working families.

Compared with other recent presidents, only Donald Trump has had a more disappointing first year - his approval rating fell from 45% on his inauguration day to 35% a year later, according to historical trends by Gallup.

Mr Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, began at a high of nearly 70% when he took office and ended close to 50% a year later. George W Bush began his first term in a similar position to Mr Biden, with approval around 60%, but that rose to nearly 90% after 9/11.

Anthony Zurcher: It's hard to say that the honeymoon is over for Joe Biden because he never really had one. His ratings started modestly positive, without the kind of big inaugural bump most presidents (not named Donald Trump) receive. Now his numbers are in the danger zone for first-term presidents hoping to win re-election - a reflection of near universal Republican dislike and a majority of independents who are souring on him.

Has he got the pandemic under control?

President Biden, who says he carries a card in his pocket with the number of Americans killed by the virus, has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his top priority.

In his first year, he has expanded vaccine availability and currently, about 75% of the US has had at least one dose, and 63% are fully vaccinated. Children as young as 5 have been eligible for the vaccine since November, 80 million booster doses have been administered to help protect against Omicron, and free at-home rapid tests have just become available to order this week.

But the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over. Over the course of the year, the US has undergone three major waves of the virus, and more than 850,000 Americans have died from Covid - the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden declared in a July speech that the US could celebrate ""independence"" from the Covid-19 pandemic. That may sit next to George W Bush's Iraq War ""mission accomplished"" banner in the hall of premature presidential victory declarations. While the White House will get credit for enacting a massive pandemic relief bill in May, its inability to prepare for the challenges presented by the Delta and Omicron variants have turned what seemed like looming success into a long, hard slog.

How has the US economy fared under his watch?

For many Americans, the number one issue facing the country is the economy. When Mr Biden took office, the pandemic had slowed job growth and the US had faced unemployment woes due to lockdown.

Employment rebounded somewhat over the last year, with 6.4 million jobs added. Though total employment remains lower than its pre-pandemic level, jobless claims have dropped to a near 50-year low.

Millions of Americans have quit their jobs. Though this shows confidence in the job market, some industries now face a labour shortage, contributing to global supply-chain problems and fuelling rocketing inflation.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden took office as the US economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns. The good news for him was falling unemployment, a booming stock market and record-setting growth. The bad news is that the velocity of the rebound led to supply-chain struggles and inflation levels not seen in decades. If the economy can shake those negative aspects off, his record will look good - but the problems have not been as ""transitory"" as the administration promised.

Has he delivered on immigration reforms?

One of Mr Biden's promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border, a Trump-era policy that angered the left.

The president kept his word on ending the so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy, and the number of minors held in detention centres has plummeted.

But since he took office, the US has seen an influx of migrants that has created new challenges. In 2021, there were almost 2 million encounters between migrants and US border officers, including 165,000 involving minors.

Long-term reforms remain elusive. Mr Biden's plan to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US has stalled in Congress, and he failed to overturn a Trump-era policy that made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard in the US.

Meanwhile, he has defended the use of a Trump policy that lets the government automatically expel undocumented asylum seekers in order to stop the spread of Covid-19. He used the so-called Title 42 policy to kick 4,000 Haitians out of Texas, drawing widespread condemnation.

Anthony Zurcher: There was always going to be an uptick in undocumented border crossings after the pandemic depressed migration levels for much of 2020. What was somewhat unexpected was that Mr Biden's immigration reforms - the ones he delivered on - super-charged the migratory crisis, swamping US border facilities unprepared for the surge. The result is that few people have been satisfied with the outcomes.

What are his accomplishments?

Despite opposition from Republicans and a fractured Democratic caucus, he managed to pass a $1tn infrastructure bill in November.

A longer term accomplishment may be his prolific appointment of judges - he has named more in his first year than any president since Ronald Reagan.

However, Mr Biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn't help him push his voting reforms through Congress. It wasn't the first time. Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, moderate Democrats in key swing states, have also held back his social-spending bill and climate agenda.

Anthony Zurcher: A lot of the focus over the past year has been on what Mr Biden hasn't accomplished in Congress versus what his administration has succeeded in pushing through. As any parent knows, making a promise you can't keep is a great way to provoke a temper tantrum. Mr Biden spread a lot of promises out on the campaign trail, some of which were unrealistic or depended on circumstances beyond his control. Now he's facing an electorate whose temper is starting to flare.",Immigration
bbc,Police,40,bbc,"Now a public inquiry into Mr Trudeau's unprecedented use of the federal Emergencies Act to end the protests against vaccine mandates and Covid measures is set to begin in Ottawa, with an extensive witness list that includes the prime minister himself as well as convoy organisers.

The act, in place between 14 February and 23 February, allowed the government to impose bans on public assembly in some areas and to prohibit travel to protest zones, including by foreign nationals, among other measures. It also gave authorities the ability to freeze bank accounts.

What do I need to know about the inquiry?

The Public Order Emergency Commission begins six weeks of hearings on Thursday that will examine the Trudeau government's decision to declare a public order emergency, the circumstances that led to that declaration, and the measures put in place by Ottawa to clear the protests.

It has also been tasked by the federal government to look into the ""evolution and goals"" of the convoy and the impact of domestic and foreign funding and disinformation. The economic impact of the protest and the work of police will also be in the spotlight.

""I am confident that, with the co-operation of all of the parties, the hearings will provide a fair and thorough process for the presentation of the evidence required for the commission to be able to give the public the answers to which it is entitled,"" said Justice Rouleau in a statement this week.

Who are the witnesses?

Asked about the coming inquiry on Wednesday, the prime minister said he felt it necessary at the time to move ""forward with measures not to be taken lightly"" and noted the process includes ensuring accountability for their use after the fact.

""I look forward to the work the commission is going to do and I know a lot of questions Canadians have will be answered,"" he said at a media event.

Further, Mr Rouleau has granted either full or partial standing to 39 individuals and entities, meaning they have an opportunity to participate directly in the proceedings. Standing privileges range from getting advance notice of documents to the ability to cross-examining witnesses.

""The protests needed to be addressed but the government also had an obligation to comply with the law and use emergency powers as a truly last resort,"" said the CCLA's Cara Zwibel on Wednesday.

bbc,Police,32,bbc,"If carried out, Cruz's death penalty will be one of only a handful of executions actually carried out every year in the US, where over 2,000 people are on death row. The US remains the only Western nation to allow capital punishment.

How will the jury decide if the gunman should get the death penalty?

In most criminal cases in the US, a jury determines culpability, and a judge decides on the punishment. But in this case, the jury will decide how he is sentenced.

If they don't give him the death penalty, the only other possible outcome for Cruz is life in prison without the possibility of parole. As per state law, however, the judge would still be able to sentence him to life in prison, even if the jury recommends that he be put to death.

In Florida, prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases where the accused has been convicted of first-degree murder with aggravating factors, which include previous felony convictions, murders that are ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel"", creating ""a risk of death to many persons"" and ""cold, calculated"" murders that were premeditated.

During the trial - which is expected to last several months - prosecutors will seek to demonstrate the aggravating factors and premeditated nature of the shooting and its grisly outcome. This is likely to include eyewitness testimony from survivors and video taken at the crime scene, as well as a possible visit to the school.

What states have the death penalty?

So far this year, seven people have been executed by five states. The most recent execution saw a 66-year-old man put to death in Arizona for the 1984 murder of an eight-year-old girl.

DPIC's deputy director, Ngozi Ndulue, told the BBC that the US has seen ""really significant, continued erosion"" in the use and acceptance of the death penalty, largely because of concerns about innocent people being executed or that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to racial minorities.

Who is most likely to be executed?

According to statistics from DPIC published earlier this year, 41% of the people still on death row are black and 42% are white, despite the fact that black people make up about 12.4% of the US population.

Ms Ndulue said that the race of the victim is among the strongest factors in the application of the death penalty. Over 75% of the victims in murder cases that have resulted in executions have been white, statistics show.

While all the prisoners currently on death rows across the US have been convicted of murder, each US state has their own rules about capital punishment, who can get the death penalty and why.

In Texas, for example, prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases where the accused has been convicted of homicide with aggravating factors, which range from murders committed for money or during an attempted kidnapping to the murders of police officers, firefighters or prison guards.

Six other states - including Texas and Oklahoma - also have laws on the books that allow for the death penalty to be sought in cases in which a minor was raped. To date, however, no death sentences have been handed down or carried out for this crime.

Lethal injections have been, and remain, the most common form of executions in the US, and were used in most executions that have taken place since 1976. In most states, it remains the only method available.

Some states, however, use other methods. In Arkansas and Florida, for example, inmates can be electrocuted if they submit a request in writing. Other states, such as Utah and Oklahoma, authorise firing squad deaths as methods of execution in cases where lethal injections are not available, or if sentenced before a certain date.

Later this year, South Carolina plans to execute convicted murderer Richard Moore by firing squad, which would mark the first time the method would be used anywhere in the US since 2010. In another case, the Supreme Court ruled in June that a Georgia inmate can die by firing squad after he argued that his veins were ""severely compromised"" and that he would suffer if given a lethal injection.

While state authorities have argued that lethal injections cause less pain and suffering than other methods, critics have argued that it possibly constitutes ""cruel and unusual"" punishment that would be contrary to the Eighth Amendment of the US constitution. The debate has seen intense legal wrangling and in 2015 reached the US Supreme Court, which ruled that condemned prisoners can only challenge the method with which they'd be executed if a viable alternative is provided.

Mr Garland, however, has come under pressure to make the death penalty available in the case of Payton Gendron, a suspected white supremacist charged with murdering 10 people in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May.

In March, the US Supreme Court re-imposed the death sentence for convicted Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, reversing an earlier appeals court ruling that voided it, arguing the judge in his original trial had failed to question potential jurors about how much they'd been following the case in the news.

Earlier in the year, then-White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration has ""grave concerns"" about whether the death penalty ""is consistent with the values that are fundamental to our sense of justice and fairness"".

The justice department, however, has defended the death sentence in Tsarnaev. Mr Garland's moratorium did not prevent prosecutors from continuing to seek capital punishment in the case.",Police

bbc,Police,10,bbc,"When Will Smith stormed on the stage during Sunday's Oscars ceremony and struck comedian Chris Rock across the face, many were shocked.

The joke that ended with a slap was a Rock quip many also found to be in poor taste - touching on a medical issue concerning Jada Pinkett Smith, Will's wife. The actor has since apologised to Rock, saying: ""I was out of line and I was wrong.""

The BBC spoke with several comedians about what it's like when a joke lands really, really badly, and what they make of the Smith-Rock showdown.

'You have the right to be offended'

Abish Mathew of India was forced to hide after taking part in a comedy roast that sparked outrage for including controversial jokes about, among other things, religion.

""All of us had to flee our respective homes in Bombay [Mumbai] and, like, hide out for a week or so because we were really scared,"" he said.

Police complaints against him and his fellow comics were filed but no charges were laid - while India's constitution ostensibly protects free speech, it makes caveats for speech that outrages religious feelings.

He said he began to wonder if his country was ready for stand-up comedy. But after talking to fellow comedians around the world, he said he realised that the issue of what you can and can't say is a ""global phenomenon"".

""'I didn't like your joke so I want to take it out on the person',"" he summarised.

Sometimes, challenge is positive, he said. Once, a group of female students at the University of Delhi protested during a performance, saying his jokes were sexist.

""They didn't choose violence. They chose protest,"" he said. ""They have the right to speak, they have the right to take offence,"" and he tried to understand their point of view.

""It's like a dam that could kind of inspire other people to also react the same way or think that is normalised,"" he said.

When Sammy Obeid watched Smith slap Rock at the Oscars, it transported him back to the time he was assaulted on stage five years ago in the US.

He had been performing at a corporate event when a drunk heckler jumped on stage and tried to punch him. He dodged the punch, but the man grabbed him and picked him up before returning to the audience.

That day was a lesson for Mr Obeid: ""If people find somebody not funny, it gets them very angry.""

Smith said he ""reacted emotionally"" to the joke Rock made about his wife's shaved head, since she suffers from alopecia, a condition that causes hair loss.

But Mr Obeid said that it doesn't always matter what you say that gets somebody mad, sometimes people just react to something they dislike.

""Very seldom do jokes get a neutral response. It's either they make you laugh, you think it's funny, or you're like, that was stupid, or that's hurtful.""

In his case, the joke he told that set the man off was downright innocuous - it was about cats. But it sent the man who attacked him - who was already not enjoying Mr Obeid's act - over the edge.

'We'll never get funding again'

An audience member once waited outside a club to beat him up (he waited in the green room until the hothead gave up and went home).

He's been arrested by the censure board in Malawi - powers-that-be thought a joke he did about his father, who worked for the government, was anti-government.

No matter where you go, there are unspoken rules about what you can and cannot say, Mr Chaponda said. When performing at a club in Zimbabwe when Robert Mugabe was in power, Mr Chaponda said he was not so much afraid for himself, but aware of the repercussions that his act could have on the owners of the venue.

""The venue said: 'Please don't do anything about the government. You are a foreigner, they'll probably let you go. But we'll never get funding again,'"" he said.

While he might not get arrested at a gig in North America or Britain, he said comedians can lose their audience or a gig if they are perceived to cross a line.

""I'm going to generalise… in Africa, you can make fun of groups, right? Be it an ethnic group, a sexuality, you can make fun of groups. But when you start making fun of powerful individuals, that's when you get in trouble,"" he said.

""In Western countries… tear apart Trump, tear apart Boris Johnson, talk about any sort of individual as much as you want. But when you start talking about the religious group or racial group, that's where you're more likely to get in trouble.""

""The person who's going to get up and punch you two weeks ago is still the drunk idiot who's going to do it this week,"" he said.

The issue of ""cancel culture"" has been in the spotlight for a number of years now, with some comedians saying a fear of offending - and the repercussions that follow - is killing comedy.

Ultimately, nobody should ever assault someone at work, she said.

""It's dangerous if someone goes up to the stage - that changes the game.""",Police
breitbart,Abortion,1575,breitbart,"MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave a record-breaking $275 million donation to abortion provider Planned Parenthood.

Scott’s $275 million donation is part of her pledge to donate the majority of her wealth. Scott walked away with a 4 percent stock interest in Amazon after her divorce from Bezos. Scott’s donation is the largest in Planned Parenthood’s history.

The multimillion-dollar donation comes as legal scholars anticipate Roe v. Wade may be overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court this term.

In their statement recognizing Scott’s donation, Planned Parenthood said 2021 “ was the worst year for abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.”

While conservative states like Texas and Mississippi have recently passed laws restricting access to abortions, the liberal state of California just passed a law making abortion free for those who want one.

Planned Parenthood president and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said Scott’s donation will help black women, who “will be most hurt by the loss of abortion access in the South and Midwest.”

“This funding will support our efforts to advance health equity by eliminating racial and structural barriers for our patients in the communities where Planned Parenthood works,” Johnson said, adding:

By starting with the Black health experience in partnership with local communities, we see this as an opportunity to not only improve health outcomes for Black patients, but to transform how all patients, especially those of color and those in rural and low income communities, experience our health care, education, and organizing efforts.

Scott announced she had donated over $3.8 billion to 465 different non-profit organizations, including Planned Parenthood, since last June. “Our team’s focus over these last nine months has included some new areas, but as always our aim has been to support the needs of underrepresented people from groups of all kinds,” Scott wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.

breitbart,Abortion,3150,breitbart,"Far-left Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) continued to speak about the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade — a ruling which hands decisions on abortion back to the states — asserting that “much” of the “forced birth movement” is not totally about life itself but about “intimidation, power, and control.”

In an Instagram story slide titled “The Forced Birth Movement & Violence,” Ocasio-Cortez asserted that the “organized forced birth movement in the US has a decades-long history of political violence,” providing a link to NARAL Pro-Choice America, which detailed actions taken by what it has dubbed “anti-choice extremists” and “anti-choice zealots” who “murdered 11 people … between 1993 and. 2016.” The post continues, asserting that pro-choice organizations have been the targets of murder, bombings, arson, kidnapping, assault, stalking, and vandalism.

Notably, Ocasio-Cortez, referencing the post, made no mention of the threats lodged against conservative justices, including Brett Kavanaugh’s recent death threat.

“Once again, much of this organized militant ‘movement’ is not about life. It is about intimidation, power, and control,” she continued before clarifying that it does not mean that all pro-life individuals are part of that movement.

“But if even the slightest risk of association makes you uncomfortable, imagine how our Muslim brothers and sisters feel about the spikes in Islamophobia whenever people conflate anyone who practices a given religion with terrorists,” she continued.

In another slide the New York lawmaker said she understood that some pro-life individuals are sincere but ultimately concluded that they do not have the right to impose their religious beliefs on others.

“‘Pro-life’ individuals can reject abortion and uphold the practices of their faith,” she said. “It does not grant them the right to violate others’ bodily autonomy,” she continued, ignoring the pro-life argument made for the baby’s bodily autonomy. She also shared a slide featuring a screenshot of an article titled, “White supremacy, racial patriarchy: two sides of the same coin.”

“If you’d like to read more about how Christian Fundamentalism is exploited politically to amplify right-wing misogynistic and racist movements, this is a thorough piece to start,” she wrote.

Her spiel comes days after calling on pro-abortion activists to go “into the streets” in protest:

“I think what the Supreme Court just did is that they chose to endanger the lives of all women and all birthing people in this country,” Ocasio-Cortez told CNN on Friday. “But not only that, they’ve chosen to strip rights from men, too. Because, frankly, the right to our own bodies and the right to form our families, this is something that belongs to all of us.”

She also took to Twitter over the weekend, accusing conservative justices of lying to Congress and calling for court expansion.",Abortion
breitbart,Abortion,1856,breitbart,"Watching Republican governors do the right thing concerning illegal aliens and the atrocities of abortion and child grooming is heartening.

It is long past time for GOP governors to vigorously defend the values of the people they represent and to do so in the same way local Democrats have done for decades.

Of course, Democrat politicians do the exact opposite of what Republican governors have started to do. Democrats are legalizing infanticide and aggressively inviting illegal aliens to flood their states — including all the violent criminals, drug mules, and sex traffickers that come with them. Democrat leaders also encourage the sexual grooming of prepubescent children, defund the police, empty the prisons, eliminate bail for violent offenders, and openly discriminate based on race and what people do with their sex organs.

In other words, Democrats are engaged in wickedness and destruction. And the results are painful to watch, especially the death and destruction in their cities, which don’t look all that different from Ukraine’s cities after a Russian retreat.

But now, and thanks in no small part to President Trump’s boldness, Republican governors are showing the same zeal as Democrats, but in ways that will improve the health and well-being of their states and citizens.

While up against enormous pressure from the corporate media’s child groomers and child groomer-enablers, Florida just passed a bill outlawing the sexual grooming of children ages four to eight in the classroom. This move protects small children from being gaslit into believing they are gay or bisexual or transsexual or pansexual or whatever other nutso shit these freaks have invented now. Additionally, this law has also smoked out the Democrat party, Never Trump, and the Walt Disney Co as degenerate child groomers and child groomer-enablers.

Other Republican-led states, like Georgia, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and about ten more, are looking at passing similar anti-grooming legislation to protect children from these predators.

Multiple Republican states are also stepping in to save unborn babies from being legally murdered.

Abortion is an atrocity. Snuffing out a human life because you can’t keep your legs closed or be bothered to get some free birth control is inexcusable and amoral. It is long past time to save the unborn. So while Democrat-led states seek to legalize abortion right up until the child is partially born, Republican-led states are stepping in to do the right thing.

Montana, Arkansas, South Carolina, Kansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, Idaho, Arizona, Wyoming, and Oklahoma, among others, are looking to put limits on or ban this ongoing slaughter of the innocent outright.

On the illegal alien front, Democrats are desperate to import sex traffickers and easily exploit labor. What’s more, you have His Fraudulency Joe Biden opening the border in the hopes of fulfilling the Democrat party’s stated desire to replace American voters with more compliant voters. Thankfully, we now have Republican-led states such as Florida and Texas pushing back. Both have pledged to ship the illegals whom feds have dumped in their states to Washington, DC, or Biden’s home state of Delaware.

I’d like to see Martha’s Vineyard added to that list.

As the federal government becomes increasingly corrupt, fascist, and lawless, as the corporate media, Hollywood, and the organized left openly target small children for abortion, sexual grooming, and other depravities, Republican-led states need to continue to step up.

breitbart,Abortion,3900,breitbart,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) has reportedly charged 11 pro-life advocates with federal charges related to a 2021 protest at a Tennessee abortion clinic.

In a press release announcing the charges on Wednesday, the Department of Justice said that the 11 individuals violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act during a 2021 protest in which they “engaged in a conspiracy to prevent” a Nashville-area abortion clinic “from providing, and patients from receiving, reproductive health services.” Their names: Chester Gallagher, Heather Idoni, Calvin Zastrow, Coleman Boyd, Caroline Davis, Paul Vaughn, Dennis Green, Eva Edl, Eva Zastrow, James Zastrow, and Paul Place.

Identifying Chester Gallagher as the leader, the department alleges that he utilized social media to coordinate the blockade of an abortion, otherwise known as a “rescue.”

“His coconspirators and others blocked the clinic’s entry doors and prevented a patient and an employee from entering,” said the department. “The 11 individuals, aided and abetted by one another, used force and physical obstruction to injure, intimidate and interfere with employees of the clinic and a patient who was seeking reproductive health services.”

Without going into specifics, the charges further allege that the activists used “physical obstruction to intimidate and interfere with the clinic’s employees and a patient, because the clinic was providing, and the patient sought reproductive health services.”

According to Live Action, the FBI attempted to raid the home of Chester (Chet) Gallagher over what they reported was a peaceful protest that local authorities did not see fit to prosecute:

The event in March 2021 was reportedly peaceful, with participants lining the inside hallway of a shared general medical office building which, in one area, houses the Carafem abortion facility. The rescuers who were gathered that day prayed and sang, and the event was nonviolent. Some recorded the events on video. Several participants were arrested by local police that day and were later released after posting bail for misdemeanor trespass charges.

FBI agents “arrived with guns drawn” at Gallagher’s home. Since Gallagher was out of state at the time, the agents also “attempted to gain information on his whereabouts from neighbors,” according to LiveAction. LifeNews reports officers “demanded his whereabouts from Gallagher’s family.”

A majority of the defendants could receive up to eleven years in prison, according to the DOJ’s announcement:

If convicted of the offenses, the seven conspiracy defendants each face up to a maximum of 11 years in prison, three years of supervised release and fines of up to $350,000. The remaining five defendants face a year in prison, one year of supervised release and a fine of up to $10,000.

The indictment was approved by a federal grand jury after the FBI raided the home of pro-life activist Mark Houck as his “screaming” children watched in horror last month over charges related to the FACE Act stemming from an incident in which Houck shoved a 72-year-old abortion activist who was escorting women into a Planned Parenthood clinic. Houck’s family maintains that the man had been harassing his 12-year-old son.",Abortion
breitbart,Abortion,2438,breitbart,"CLAIM: The Supreme Court’s impending reversal of Roe v. Wade (1973) means “a whole range of rights are in question.”

FALSE: The majority specifically confines its decision to abortion, which is unique because it involves potential human life.

Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito explicitly rejects the claim made by President Joe Biden and others on Tuesday that reversing Roe v. Wade means undoing all other Court rulings on social issues or undermining private rights in other cases.

Alito’s opinion for a 5-4 majority of the Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case about a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, was published by Politico on Monday after an unprecedented leak.

On Tuesday, President Biden reacted to the decision by warning that reversing Roe would mean undoing the right to contraception in Griswold v. Connecticut, and other rights involving privacy. “If the rationale of the decision, as released, were to be sustained, a whole range of rights are in question.”

Biden’s arguments were echoed by other left-wing pundits, and who warned that the right to interracial marriage in Lawrence, the right to same-sex marriage in Obergefell, and other rights were in danger.

Some even claimed, falsely, that Alito specifically linked his rationale for overturning Roe to these other cases. But Alito, in fact, distinguished the decision in Roe from these other cases, because only abortion involves taking a potential human life.

Alito began that portion of his argument (page 31 on the leaked draft) by noting that Casey v. Planned Parenthood (1992), a follow-up to Roe, defended the right to abortion by citing precedents establishing many of these other rights, which he listed.

Alito then noted that the right to privacy was not absolute: if it were, it would “license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like.” Moreover, he said, abortion was different from the many other rights the Court had recognized:

What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both these decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call “potential life” and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an “unborn human being.” See Roe, 410 U.S., at 159 (abortion is “inherently different”); Casey, 505 U.S., at 852 (abortion is a “unique act”). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.

Alito then turned to the argument that without abortion rights, people might not be able to choose “the types of relationships they desire,” and that women might not be able to compete with men in the workplace. Those, he said, were policy arguments, not arguments about rights, and such policy arguments belonged within the purview of the states, not the courts. He added that the pro-life side also made policy arguments, and that the proper venue for that debate was in legislatures.

Later in the draft decision, Alito again addressed the argument, put forward by the Biden administration’s solicitor general, that reversing Roe would affect other rights. He cited Casey, which itself recognized that abortion is “a unique act” because it ends “life or potential life.” He also cited Roe, which distinguished abortion from “marital intimacy.”

“And to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to case doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.”

Alito’s opinion is apparently joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts apparently would have upheld the Mississippi law, but sided with the Court’s liberals against overturning Roe.

breitbart,Abortion,1782,breitbart,"More Americans favor the idea of a 15-week abortion ban than oppose it, according to a new poll from the Wall Street Journal.

Nearly half — 48 percent — of 1,500 registered voters polled said they would “strongly or somewhat favor such restrictions, with exemptions to protect the health of the mother.” Forty-three percent of voters oppose the idea of a 15-week abortion ban. The results come as the Supreme Court considers whether to allow Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks gestation to stand.

“A total of 31 percent of voters said they strongly support a 15-week ban, while 17 percent were somewhat in support. Another 34 percent said they strongly opposed such a ban, and 10 percent said they were somewhat opposed,” according to the Journal.

However, 55 percent of voters reportedly say they want “abortion to be legal in all or most cases.” Thirty percent say abortion should be illegal except for cases that involve rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger. Eleven percent say abortion “should be illegal in all circumstances.”

“There are going to be hardened people on both ends,” Republican pollster Tony Fabrizi said. Fabrizi’s firm conducted the poll with Democrat pollster John Anzalone. “But most people are somewhere in between and a lot of people pick and choose.”

Unsurprisingly, 69 percent of Democrats polled say they are opposed to a 15-week abortion ban, while 21 percent say they support the ban. In contrast, 75 percent of Republicans support the ban and 20 percent oppose it.

The poll results are similar to other surveys taken in regards to how voters feel about limits on abortion. A Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll released on the eve of the 2022 March for Life revealed that 71 percent of Americans support legal limits on abortion. According to the poll’s results, 49 percent of Democrats support limits on abortion, while 93 percent of Republicans and 70 percent of independents support the same.

Another poll released by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) in June 2021, after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the Mississippi case, found that 53 percent of likely voters say they are more likely to vote for a Republican candidate who supports a 15-week limit on abortion compared to 28 percent who would rather vote for a Democrat who backs unlimited abortion up until the time of birth.

The Wall Street Journal poll was conducted with 1,500 registered voters between March 2-7. The margin of error for the question about whether voters wanted abortion to be legal or illegal was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and 3.6 percentage points for the question about the 15-week ban.

breitbart,Abortion,3898,breitbart,"President Joe Biden voiced concerns that there were not enough abortions allowed in the United States after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

The president warned that “extremist laws” in Republican states were limiting abortions across the country, which he complained was backward.

“Folks, what century are we in? I mean… How? What are we doing?” Biden said, warning that the right to contraception would soon be questioned.

Biden met with his “Reproductive Rights Taskforce” at the White House, which was put together to help women find access to abortions despite bans across the country.

“As I’ve said before, the court got Roe right nearly 50 years ago,” Biden insisted.

The president met with abortion doctors to discuss their own experiences of women in Republican states begging them for abortions, praising them for serving “on the front lines of this crisis.”

Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona warned that the Supreme Court ruling was creating a culture of “fear and confusion on college campuses” warning of a “chilling” effect on universities.

A number of hand-picked doctors visiting the White House also voiced their opposition to the Supreme Court decision.

“My colleagues and I have to think about whether we’re going to be criminalized and imprisoned, whether our licenses will be taken away, whether our livelihood will be threatened for providing compassionate evidence-based care (abortions),” one physician said.

One abortion doctor, who identified her pronouns as “she/her,” angrily denounced the decision as a way for Republicans to force women to have babies.

“Abortion is healthcare. It is our human right,” she said defiantly.

One physician complained that abortion was outlawed in the state of Wisconsin, except to save the life of the mother.

“Pregnant people don’t have a warning light when it crosses that threshold,” she said, adding that “the effects are chilling.”",Abortion
breitbart,Abortion,2412,breitbart,"Whoever leaked the alleged draft of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has committed the “original sin for judicial ethics,” said Jonathan Turley, criminal defense attorney and Shapiro professor of public interest law at George Washington University.

Politico published an alleged draft on Monday of the Court’s decision to overrule Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case. The case revolves around Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban and is the most significant challenge in decades to the Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which declared abortion to be protected by the U.S. Constitution. The draft was seemingly written by Justice Samuel Alito and has circulated inside the Court, the news outlet reported.

“We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Alito allegedly wrote in the document, which is labeled as the “Opinion of the Court.” “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”

Turley said the leak represents “one of the greatest breaches of security in the history of the Court.”

“The alleged leak of the opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization is nothing short of breathtaking. It would constitute one of the greatest breaches of security in the history of the Court,” Turley tweeted. “…The article represents the greatest crisis that Chief Justice John Roberts has faced in his tenure on the Court. It is a breach of the most fundamental obligations and traditions of the Court.”

Turley noted that if Politico indeed obtained a true copy of the drafted opinion, “it is hard not to view this as a malicious act.”

“What is the motivation of releasing such a decision? The only intent of such a leak is to trigger a response from outside of the Court,” he continued. “…This draft is from February and the majority can shift on such opinions. However, the act of leaking such a draft opinion ranks as an original sin for judicial ethics.”

He surmised the leak could be an effort to “pressure the Court and push the legislation in Congress on a federal abortion law before the midterm elections. It will also likely renew the call for court packing.”

“The fact that some are praising this leak shows how utterly craven we have become in our politics,” he concluded. “There appears no ethical rule or institutional interest that can withstand this age of rage.”

That could be a reference to rumors that the far-left “dark money” group Arabella Advisors has been pushing Jackson, funded by ultra-left activists like George Soros.

Jackson serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after receiving confirmation in 2021 with a vote of 53-47. Three Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) voted to confirm her in 2021.

Graham lamented Biden’s pick for the Supreme Court, having urged the president to nominate Michelle Childs, a judge for the U.S. District Court of South Carolina. He explained:

Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), another member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Friday:

President Biden’s announcement just days after an unprovoked full scale invasion by Russia is extremely inappropriate. Once again, Biden is putting the demands of the radical progressive left ahead of what is best for our nation. It is an attempt to hide that for over three months Biden refused to levy sanctions against Russia or send military assistance to Ukraine. However, I cannot hold President Biden’s failure to lead our nation against his nominee. I do plan on meeting with the President’s nominee in person, and thoroughly vetting her record to determine if she is a person of high character. A Supreme Court nominee must be committed to upholding the rule of law and Constitution as written. We must not blindly confirm a justice to serve as a rubber stamp for a radical progressive agenda.

Jackson has expressed many beliefs that many would consider leftist.

As an attorney, Jackson wrote a brief on behalf of pro-abortion groups, supporting a law that blocked pro-life advocates from approaching abortion clinics. She ruled against the Trump administration in a lawsuit challenging executive orders on the collective bargaining rights of federal employee unions.

She also overruled presidential immunity to require former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, a very troubling precedent against the idea that every person is entitled to attorney-client confidentiality when speaking with his lawyer, and that no one needs the ability to do that more than the U.S. president, regardless of political party.

Many anti-religious liberty, pro-abortion, and LGBT rights groups have endorsed Jackson.

Collins, who voted for Jackson for the D.C. Circuit, said in a statement on Friday, “Ketanji Brown Jackson is an experienced federal judge with impressive academic and legal credentials.”

She added, “I will conduct a thorough vetting of Judge Jackson’s nomination and look forward to her public hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and to meeting with her in my office.”

breitbart,Abortion,2567,breitbart,"A massive PR firm that represents high-profile corporations like Coca-Cola, AT&T, and Starbucks is privately advising its clients to remain silent on abortion rights, according to an internal email obtained by Popular Information.

With its top corporate clients – including Kia Motors, Astra Zeneca, and Pizza Hut, Zeno Group, a subsidiary of the world’s largest public relations conglomerate, Edelman Holdings, earns almost $120 million in annual revenue.

Zeno Group’s Executive Vice President for Media Strategy, Katie Cwayna, sent company staff “a template email to share with client contacts” with instructions on reacting to reports that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision.

According to the email, Zeno warned its clients that “the media” and others “will look for corporations to take a stand and make their views known.”

Zeno suggests its corporate clients remain silent on the issue because taking a public stance could be a “no-win” situation for companies.

Do not take a stance you cannot reverse, especially when the decision is not final. This topic is a textbook “50/50” issue. Subjects that divide the country can sometimes be no-win situations for companies because regardless of what they do they will alienate at least 15 to 30 percent of their stakeholders… Do not assume that all of your employees, customers or investors share your view.

Although the email paints abortion rights as a “50/50” issue, a recent poll found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be either “mostly” or “always” illegal, and support banning abortion completely after 15 weeks.

Zeno continued to warn its clients to stay away from the media entirely. “Avoid media’ fishing.’ Often during controversy, media will make general inquiries to multiple peer organizations, in which the first one to “raise its hand” becomes the lead,” the email template continued. Zeno told its clients that being at the center of the abortion issue is “not advisable,” and to “be judicious” with managing press inquiries.

The email template also provided its clients with advice on talking to reporters, which is to avoid them.

“Steer clear of breaking news networks/outlets,” the email said. “We anticipate the story will dominate newsfeeds for the rest of the week as more details unfold, so avoid pitching reporters and outlets that focus on breaking news.”

Along with media silence on the issue, companies are being told to remain silent on their social media accounts as well.

“Do not engage with direct questions about your company’s position,” the email added. “Whether in direct messages or public-facing posts, do not respond to questions about where your company stands on this issue.”

Zeno Group also consults top brands such as ASICS, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Phillips Health, Corona, Prudential, and Leveno.

Zeno’s message to its corporate clients telling them to avoid the abortion debate can be summed up by the following mantra: “go woke, go broke.”

Zeno Group also consults Netflix, which is dealing with its own fallout after the company made a dedicated shift towards “wokeness.”

In the last half-year, Netflix’s stock price has fallen from $671 to $215, and subscribers are also leaving the platform en masse. As a result, Netflix now performs the worst out of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500.

The PR firm’s advice to stay silent on this hot button issue also comes after the highly contested feud between Disney and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over the state’s recently enacted Parental Rights in Education Law.

However, Zeno Group CEO Barby Siegel told Popular Information the company believes in “a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare,” after the report on the internal email was published.

“At Zeno, we believe in equal access to healthcare for all, and a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare,” Siegel said. “At the same time, we live in a world with different opinions and different views, and we respect those differences.”

Siegel also added that the email template “does not accurately reflect Zeno’s position or the range of counsel that we are providing to clients.” Siegel claimed the advice was provided within the first 24 hours after Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion was leaked and intended to ” counsel clients to be measured in their immediate response to a complex developing story.”",Abortion
breitbart,Abortion,2537,breitbart,"Former state Rep. Vernon Jones, a conservative Democrat-turned-Republican running for Congress in Georgia, labeled the Democratic Party “the most extreme organization in the world” as he recalled the party’s support for slavery and the Ku Klux Klan, as well as its current attacks on law enforcement and “independent think[ing].”

In a video posted Thursday, Jones blasted the Democratic Party after President Joe Biden attacked MAGA — the acronym for former President Donald Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again.”

Biden made the divisive remarks Wednesday, as he addressed the impending Supreme Court decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade 1973 abortion case.

“What are the next things that are going to be attacked?” Biden asked. “Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that’s existed in American history, in recent American history.”

While campaigning in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, Jones said, “We’re taking it to them.”

“They’re feeling the burn but I have to pause for the cause because when I heard that Joe Biden said that we MAGA folks — that we’re the most extreme organization in the world, I almost fell off the campaign trail,” he said.

Jones, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump in his run for Congress, expressed his surprise over the remarks “because Joe Biden belongs to the Democratic Party,” which he accused of racism.

“That’s the most extreme organization in the world, if there is one,” he said in the nearly 2-minute clip.

“[T]he Democrats were the ones who opposed freeing the slaves; the Democrats were the ones who started the KKK,” he added.

He also called out the president for showing honor to Robert Byrd, the former majority leader of the Democratic Party and an avowed Klansman who was once an “exalted cyclops” in the Ku Klux Klan.

“It was Joe Biden’s best friend, Senator… Robert Byrd from Virginia, who was the chapter president of the Ku Klux Klan,” Jones said. “And Joe Biden eulogized him and called him his mentor.”

Claiming “this is [the] Democratic Party now,” Jones noted it was “a Democratic Party who attacked law enforcement officers [and] who want to defund the police departments.”

“This same group do not want babies to be born,” he said. “This is extreme.”

The 61-year-old congressional candidate warned that Democrats “will attack you for being an independent thinker,” as he pointed to COVID vaccination policies to highlight what he viewed as hypocrisy.

“This is the same group that said, ‘My body, my choice’ when it comes to abortions but not when it comes to the vaccine mandate,” he said. “But what happened to, ‘My body, my choice’ then?”

Referring to “Mr. extreme” Biden’s comments against MAGA, Jones replied that it was the president and his party that were, in fact, the extremists.

“So when Joe Biden says that, Joe Biden is the extreme [one] and so is the Democratic Party,” he said. “And that’s why we’re going to take our country back; we’re going to take our state back.”

Jones, who switched parties in 2020 and endorsed then-President Trump’s re-election campaign, is narrowly leading his closest competitor, trucking company owner Mike Collins, in the Republican primary race for U.S. Congress in Georgia’s Tenth District, according to an internal poll obtained by Breitbart News.

In 2020, he explained why “a lifelong Democrat [was] speaking at the Republican National Convention (RNC).”

“[Because] the Democratic Party does not want black people to leave their mental plantation; we’ve been forced to be there for decades and generations,” he said.

“But I have news for Joe Biden: We are free people with free minds,” Jones added. “I am part of a large and growing segment of the black community who are independent thinkers, and we believe that Donald Trump is the President that America needs to lead us forward.”",Abortion
breitbart,Abortion,2716,breitbart,"ARLINGTON, Virginia — Pro-abortion protesters outside George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School Thursday afternoon called for “mandatory vasectomies” and claimed that “the Bible itself tells you how to perform abortions.”

About 30 abortion advocates gathered outside the front entrance to the law school in Arlington, Virginia, to protest an address set to be given by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito at the school.

The address was being given by Alito remotely from the court building while fallout from a draft opinion overturing infamous pro-abortion case Roe v. Wade — written by Alito — was leaked, leading leftists to gather outside justices homes to protest.

According to reports, Alito had been moved to an undisclosed location for his own safety after justices’ home addresses were published online.

“The Bible itself tells you how to perform abortions,” one speaker, who spoke about an abortion she had gotten proudly next to her young daughter, claimed. “It talks about … performing abortions in numerous aspects.”

After seeking refuge under a tent as it began to sprinkle with rain, the same speaker asked the other protesters if there was legislation do mandate vasectomies. After the group responded, “No!” the woman started chanting, “mandatory vasectomies!”

This same speaker claimed “abortion is a human right” that is part of the reason she went to law school — apparently at George Mason University.

“Abortion saves lives,” she continued, apparently unironically. “It makes it to where kids can keep their mothers. Fifty-six percent of abortions are done by mothers.”

“Roe v. Wade is essential healthcare, it’s the right to privacy,” she said before erroneously claiming that the case also affects the legality of interracial marriage, contraception, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Speaking about women as though they are a monolithic voting block, the speaker said, “Don’t you think that if the women of this nation — the 52 percent of this nation that is female — stood up and took up arms that they would not have it and they would put in gun rights and gun restrictions almost immediately?”

She then questioned why Justice Amy Coney Barrett would have a police officer outside her home after her address was doxxed by leftists before questioning why Alito had to call in virtually instead of being in-person, apparently without recognizing that the left has made it dangerous for the justices to go out in public.

One freshman who said she is originally from Tennessee and said the Volunteer State put in place a “trigger law” that would make abortion illegal as soon as Roe was overturned officially.

“I think about my senator, Marsha Blackburn, who preaches about saving the children,” she said. “Marsha, how can you save the children if you are forcing them to give birth?”

“I think about my governor, Bill Lee, who passed this ‘trigger law,’ and I think about how he runs on the premise of bettering mental health in Tennessee,” she continued.

“What about the women who would rather kill themselves than give birth to a child?” she yelled to cheers. “What about the women who don’t want to have children because they could pass on hereditary mental illness?”

Addressing those who are in favor of ending abortion, the freshman said, “remember that ending abortion does not end abortion, it ends safe abortion.”

“You will be killing us with this ruling,” she continued. “To Justice Alito: I will not forget your brief when the women in my state are dying. And to every single judge that has voted in favor of overturning Roe: I will not forget you when the entire nation is dying.”

“You will have blood on your hands,” she yelled, apparently unironically. “And your hands will be covered in blood just like my state will be.”

breitbart,COVID,888,breitbart,"Dr. Ben Carson, a pediatric neurologist and former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the Trump administration, said children who have been forced to mask for more than two years because of the coronavirus will suffer consequences.

“You look at the mask-wearing, particularly at a young age when you’re trying to develop your sociological image of yourself,” Carson said on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando. “And a lot of that is because of positive feedback that you get by looking at people’s facial expressions.”

“We’re going to end up with a whole generation of pathological people who don’t know how to interact with each other,” Carson said and as evidenced by the behavior problems children are having when returning to the classroom after months of “remote learning.”

“Previous shifts from in-person to remote or hybrid learning (a combination of the two) during the COVID-19 pandemic have posed challenges for kids that have caused them to act out, according to Harvard University researchers,” U.S. News and World Report reported on the study.

Carson noted that over 2020 and 2021, the number of emergency room psychiatric visits by children increased by 40 percent.

Ferguson asked Carson if he was a “bad parent” because he didn’t want to vaccinate his young children.

“No, it makes you a very good parent,” Carson said. “It makes you someone who was really concerned. That’s why God gave children parents, you know, to be interested.”

“These people, for instance, who say parents really shouldn’t have anything to do with the education of their children. I mean, where did these people come from?” Carson said.",COVID
breitbart,COVID,1456,breitbart,"Anthony Fauci refuses to give the all-clear in regards to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, now claiming that “we have a way to go” before it is over.

Fauci, the highest-paid employee in the federal government, has said that he does not plan to retire until the U.S. is “out of the pandemic phase.” And while he previously stated that “I think we might be there already, if we can stay in this,” he flip-flopped over the weekend, telling ABC News’s George Stephanopoulos, “We have a way to go,” signaling that he is not leaving his post anytime soon.

“I’m not so sure, George,” Fauci said when asked if we are approaching a point past the pandemic phase.

“I want to make sure we’re really out of this before I really seriously consider doing anything different. We are still in this. We have a way to go,” he said, adding that he believes we are “clearly going the right direction.”

“I hope we stay that way,” he added.

In the interview, Fauci added that Americans should be prepared to “pivot and perhaps reinstitute some of those restrictions” if officials deem it necessary. He has made similar remarks over the last week.

“You can go ahead and continue to tiptoe towards normality, which is what we’re doing, but at the same time, be aware that you may have to reverse,” Fauci said during an appearance on the podcast Start Here.

breitbart,COVID,1186,breitbart,"Officials in Boston, Massachusetts, announced their decision to lift the city’s health emergency declaration, but they will continue to force children to wear masks in school for the time being.

The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) made the announcement Wednesday, lifting the declaration, which has remained in place for nearly two years.

“In the early stages of the pandemic, the declaration was really instrumental in our ability to establish an incident command structure and our ability to deploy staff and resources to perform crisis response, as well as health care coordination functions,” BPHC Executive Director Dr. Bisola Ojikutu claimed.

With this move, the orders, including the indoor mask mandate, will be no more. However, officials also made it clear they will use the health emergency declaration again in the future, if needed. As Boston.com reported:

But now, she said, all the orders that were under the declaration have been rescinded, or are set to rescind April 1. Those orders include the citywide indoor mask mandate, the eviction moratorium, the declaration of a public health crisis related to unsheltered homelessness and substance use disorder, and the proof of vaccination mandate for public indoor gatherings. Ojikutu made clear that the BPHC is still monitoring COVID-19 levels in the city, and is in the process of creating action plans should another variant surge occur. She said the commission will still be evaluating different COVID-19 metrics and could decide to reinstate the declaration in the future if necessary.

However, absent from the plans was an announcement freeing Boston school children from forced masking. While officials acknowledged the school system has seen a decrease in coronavirus cases, even avoiding recent spikes, they want to base the end of forced masking on the number of cases in the city per capita — a relatively bizarre metric, as they will no longer force adults to wear masks in public.

Once the marker drops to ten cases or less per 100,000 in the city, officials would recommend lifting the mask mandate on school children. The number currently sits at 13 per 100,000.

The decision to refrain from lifting the school mask mandate comes one month after Boston Mayor Michelle Wu (D) claimed that children wanted to remain masked up for a longer period of time:",COVID
breitbart,COVID,2310,breitbart,"The White House detailed plans Tuesday for more coronavirus vaccines, suggesting future vaccines would be more effective if the government continued to fund the research.

“It is possible that we may get a whole new generation of vaccines in the Fall or Winter that may be more effective and more durable,” White House COVID-⁠19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha told reporters during the daily briefing.

Jha said the Food and Drug agency was working with the Moderna and Pfizer pharmaceutical companies to develop new vaccines, and urged Congress to pass more coronavirus research funding.

“None of those are going to be available to the American people if we don’t get more funding,” he warned.

Jha is the new coronavirus czar for the Biden administration after Jeff Zients stepped down in March.

Zients also urged Congress to fund additional vaccine research and development, floating the idea of a “variant-specific vaccine” as the pandemic continues.

Sixty percent of Americans have been infected by the virus, including Vice President Kamala Harris who tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday.

Jha acknowledged the current vaccines were not able to prevent Americans from getting infected.

“We have a very, very contagious variant out there,” he said. “It is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets COVID in America. That’s not even a policy goal.”

But Jha stressed the importance of getting the entire world vaccinated for the virus, criticizing officials who wanted to focus on a “domestic-only” approach.

“That’s not a thing. You can’t do that,” he said. “If we’re going to fight a global pandemic, we have to have a global approach.”",COVID
breitbart,COVID,1128,breitbart,"Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), running for Senate in Alabama, is leading a House Republican effort to end the federal mask mandate on public transportation including United States domestic commercial flights.

“The American people are sick and tired of being dictated to by unelected Washington bureaucrats,” Brooks said in a statement.

Brooks has introduced the “Freedom to Fly Maskless Act” with co-sponsors like Reps. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Scott Perry (R-PA), and Tom Tiffany (R-WI), to prohibit the federal government from mandating masks, negative Chinese coronavirus tests, and vaccinations on all public transportation.

“Unelected bureaucrats have falsely claimed the power to foist unnecessary and anti-science mandates on the American people,” Brooks said. “These mandates have resulted in good Americans being fired from their jobs, being jabbed with needles against their will, and even losing their businesses in some cases.”

“It is time to throw off the heavy boot of tyranny that’s crushing the American spirit,” he continued. “Washington bureaucrats need reminding that America was founded on freedom and liberty.”

The federal mask mandate for Americans flying on commercial flights has remained in effect for nearly two years, even as airline executives have admitted that planes are some of the safest environments because of their highly filtrated air condition systems.

“Continued mandates are not justified, and it’s long past time Americans return to our pre-pandemic lives,” Brooks said.

In the Alabama Senate GOP primary race, set for May 24, Brooks has been endorsed by former President Trump and is backed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), and the National Association for Gun Rights, among others.

breitbart,COVID,805,breitbart,"Republican Study Committee (RSC) member Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) proposed a bill Tuesday that would allow citizens to sue the federal government as well as state and local governments that may jeopardize one’s job with harsh coronavirus vaccine mandates, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.

Harshbarger’s bill would allow citizens who feel forced to take the coronavirus vaccines to bring civil actions for compensatory damages, including economic and non-economic damages, against the federal government and any state or local government that imposes a mandate that threatens one’s employment.

Harshbarger said in a statement that Americans should not have to choose between their jobs and their employment,

“The Biden Administration’s unconstitutional mandates forced many Americans to choose between their job or getting vaccinated. While this is wrong and never should have happened, those forced into vaccination should have full rights to pursue legal action if they are injured,” she explained. “My bill — the Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act — is a step in the right direction towards holding this administration and our government accountable.”

“The Left forced Americans into medical procedures against their will and simultaneously restricted their right to sue for injuries,” RSC Chairman Jim Banks (R-IN) said. “It’s unacceptable. If vaccine mandates are ethical, why do they require a legal carveout? The Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act will give Americans hurt by a medical decision they were forced into a real, substantive legal recourse.”

Reps. Banks, Bill Posey (R-FL), Dough LaMalfa (R-CA). Randy Weber (R-TX), Brian Babin (R-TX), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Yvette Herrell (R-NM) are the original cosponsors of the legislation.

Under current law, Americans have few legal remedies to seek compensation for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates. Those seeking compensation generally have to use the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CPIP). This program has no court, judge, or right to appeal, and decisions are made solely by a bureaucratic administrator. Compensation for lost wages and death benefits are often arbitrarily capped, with no opportunity for collecting damages for pain and suffering, and a one-year statutory limit for making a claim. There is also no compensation for attorney fees, which makes it difficult for lower-income Americans to find legal counsel.

In contrast, Harshbarger’s legislation would let any citizen sue the federal government or any state or local government in a federal district court for relief and compensatory damages whose employment was impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates. It would also allow courts to award attorney’s fees to a citizen that wins in court.

Since the release of the coronavirus vaccines, and as of February 1, 2022, not one single American has been awarded compensation through CPIP for coronavirus-vaccine injury claims.

One study found that .3 percent of participants reported an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis after partial vaccination, and .2 percent experienced a negative reaction after full vaccination. The CDC maintains that less than one percent of those who received the Pfizer vaccine experienced a serious adverse effect.

The legislation’s “Congressional Findings” declare that coronavirus vaccine mandates are “authoritarian” and lack a “scientific basis” for public health needs:

Government-imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates that threaten Americans’ jobs and livelihoods are authoritarian, unnecessary, overreaching, irrational, needlessly divisive, and lack a purported scientific basis for public health needs. The policy of the United States is to recognize, defend, and protect the inherent rights of the individual, including the right of liberty, the right to be secure in one’s person, the right of the individual to be informed about any medical procedures, treatment, or vaccination, and the right of the individual to provide or withhold consent to such procedures, treatment, or vaccination. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that while COVID-19 vaccination can lessen the severity of illness for individuals in certain higher-risk categories, it DOES NOT preclude Americans from contracting, spreading, or being hospitalized by the COVID-19 virus. The protection of individual rights to make one’s own medical decisions in consultation with his or her health care provider — without fear of coercion, forced vaccination, loss of civil liberties, or risk of adverse employment action — is especially needed at a time when it is critical for our Nation to increase trust in public health officials. Protection of these individual rights is also vital for encouraging — where and when medically appropriate — vaccination and/or other scientific measures for keeping Americans safe and healthy.

“This Act further protects Americans’ constitutional medical rights by holding federal, state, and local governments accountable for unnecessary, irrational, overreaching, and liberty-infringing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, when many other scientifically-proven, and less liberty-intrusive tools exist for mitigating the effects of and protecting against COVID-19,” the findings conclude.

breitbart,COVID,206,breitbart,"A majority of U.S. voters oppose draconian coronavirus policies, including shifting schools to remote learning, vaccine passports, and mandatory booster shots.

According to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll released on Monday, 65.5 percent of respondents say they “oppose shifting schools to remote learning.” Nearly 73 percent are against a six-week worldwide shutdown “to end the pandemic once and for all.”

Likewise, 52.9 percent of 1,000 U.S. voters polled between Dec. 27-30 opposed requiring booster vaccination within the next 90 days in public spaces, and 54.5 percent are against vaccine passports for public spaces.

U.S. voters do approve of some coronavirus measures, including social distancing and masking — 64.6 percent support social distancing and 54.2 percent support masking in public spaces.

When asked when they think the coronavirus pandemic will end in the United States, most voters said “in a few years,” at 32.4 percent and, more worryingly, “never” at 32.3 percent. Nearly 18 percent say the pandemic will end in the U.S. by the end of 2022.

The survey, which has a margin of error of +/-3.1 percentage points, also found that 47.2 percent of voters disapprove of President Joe Biden’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, compared to 46.90 who approve.

The poll was taken right before at least 3,200 schools closed due to the low-risk omicron variant. Many large school districts, like Washington, DC, and Baltimore, Maryland, have decided to extend winter break to implement wide-scale testing before returning to school, as well as closures or remote learning.",COVID
breitbart,COVID,4455,breitbart,"A video unveiled by the White Coat Waste Project, a taxpayer watchdog group, shows that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) dismissed calls to stop the funding of dangerous gain-of-function projects abroad, deeming them “conspiracy theories.”

The organization, which blew the lid off the NIH funding the gain-of-function experiments in the Wuhan lab, recently discovered a June 9 video from the 124th Advisory Committee to the Director Meeting in which officials discussed a series of “amendments to watch” as they related to Republicans desiring to get a grip on funding for dangerous gain-of-function experiments across the globe.

Adrienne Hallett, NIH associate director for Legislative Policy and Analysis, asserted during the meeting that lawmakers were ” reacting to many of the controversies,” even accusing them of falling for “many of the conspiracy theories that swirled during the pandemic.”

“There’s a lot of conversation about enhanced pathogens. … There’s a lot of conversation about international research, possible restrictions on different kinds of research,” she continued, urging others to remain aware of these efforts.

“There are a lot of permutations of this language that are out there and moving. We’re watching all of it, but I want you to be aware of it,” she said. “If we get out of this calendar year without some kind of policy being made, next year I think this will come back”:

Dr. Anthony Fauci initially testified before Congress that the NIH did not fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan lab — an assertion the NIH ultimately contradicted via a letter, revealing that an NIH grant was awarded to EcoHealth Alliance, which was then sub-awarded to the Wuhan lab. The project tested “if spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model”:

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is one of the main politicians who has challenged Fauci for being dishonest about gain-of-function research, accusing him of changing the definition of that type of research to, he asserted, “cover your ass.”

“You’re simply saying it doesn’t exist because you changed the definition on the NIH website. This is terrible and you’re completely trying to escape the idea that we should do something about trying to prevent a pandemic from leaking from a lab,” Paul said during a November 2021 hearing.

And what you’ve done is change the definition on your website to try to cover your ass, basically. That’s what you’ve done; you’ve changed the website to change the definition that doesn’t include the risky research that’s going on. Until you admit that it’s risky, we’re not going to get anywhere. You have to admit that this research was risky. The NIH has now rebuked them; your own agency has rebuked them. You’re still unwilling to admit that they gained in function when they say they became sicker. They gained in lethality. It’s a new virus. That’s not gain-of-function?

“The NIH’s top white coats are spreading misinformation and circling the wagons because their worst nightmare is coming true: Democrats and Republicans in Congress and taxpayers across the country have united to cut the purse strings on the agency’s wasteful and dangerous spending on animal experiments,” Justin Goodman, senior vice president of Advocacy & Public Policy, White Coat Waste Project, said in a statement:

breitbart,COVID,168,breitbart,"California’s K-12 students suffered considerable academic setbacks during the 2020-21 pandemic school year, according to data from the state’s Department of Education.

Nearly half of students who took last year’s standardized test failed to meet English language arts standards set by the state. In addition, younger students performed worse than older students, indicating the impact remote learning had on those still developing their literacy skills.

About 60 percent of third and fourth graders did not meet English standards. For 11th graders, 40 percent failed to meet English standards. Over 60 percent of black and Latino students didn’t meet the criteria.

California Department of Education data shows students also suffered academically in their mathematics classes. About two-thirds of all California students failed to meet the state’s math standards. Nearly 70 percent of fifth, sixth, and eighth grade students didn’t reach the standards. For fourth, seventh, and 11th graders, close to 65 percent failed to meet math standards.

The 2020-21 standardized test was the first test administered since the U.S. Department of Education waived a federal testing requirement after classrooms closed in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Despite these setbacks, the data did not defeat California State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond. “The story is challenging but not as challenging as I expected it might be based on other projections — and for the older kids it’s much less discouraging than what we would have feared,” she said.

Along with disappointing math and English results, Graduation rates slightly declined statewide. In 2019-20, the four-year graduation rate was 84.2 percent. Last year, it declined to 83.6 percent. Again, black students were impacted the most, with their graduation rates falling over four points from 76.8 to 72.5 percent.

“For that 4 percent, those are students whose life trajectories have perhaps been changed forever,” said Heather Hough, executive director of Policy Analysis for California Education.

Adding to last year’s academic setbacks was an increased chronic absenteeism rate, where students are absent for at least ten percent of the school year. The chronic absenteeism rate rose from about 12 percent to 14 percent for the remote learning school year.

“Those students who didn’t participate are probably the most likely to have been disconnected from online learning, to be chronically absent or to not have as much support at home,” Hough said. “The results are alarming. I think they underscore something we have understood from prior research.”",COVID
breitbart,COVID,676,breitbart,"Randi Weingarten, the president of America’s largest teachers’ union, told CNN that keeping children masked in school is “absolutely the right way.”

Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom Thursday, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) leader applauded New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s (D) decision to maintain masking for children in schools until at least March while lifting virtually all other mask mandates in the state.

“I think I’m just going to lift up the one governor who I think is doing it absolutely the right way,” Weingarten said.

Hochul lifted New York’s mask mandates for businesses and most indoor public settings but excluded places where groups gather like public transit. She also excluded schools, despite the fact that children are at the lowest risk for negative effects of the coronavirus.

The Empire State’s governor has also advocated for children to get the vaccine and is not happy with the number of children in her state who have yet to get the shot. As such, she announced school districts will distribute testing kits and, given the results, make a determination on masks in schools.

New York parent and founder of “Keep NYC Schools Open” Daniella Jampel, a Democrat, said, “Starting today, maskless NYers can go to grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, and just about anywhere else. Our kids, however, will spend 7 hours behind a mask, struggling to hear their friends and understand their teacher.”

Weingarten, who claims to care about the wellbeing of children, has used her organization as a driving force behind keeping schools closed and children masked, despite the ample and growing evidence that both have been absolutely detrimental for the social and educational development of children as well as their mental health. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation have all skyrocketed among children, as well as learning loss and underdeveloped speaking, reading, and writing capabilities.

In November 2020, AFT affiliated United Federation of Teachers pushed heavily for the shut down of New York City’s entire public school system.

Meanwhile, Weingarten also recently came under fire for saying on MSNBC that masking children in school can only end when there is “no transmission in schools.”

breitbart,COVID,4261,breitbart,"Dr. Anthony Fauci is urging Americans to get tested for the Chinese coronavirus prior to attending Thanksgiving gatherings, adding that “everybody” should not only be vaccinated but boosted as well.

Fauci spoke on Tuesday for his last White House press briefing before stepping down and ended his stint by declaring that “everybody” should be at least triple jabbed, receiving the regular vaccine series as well as a booster shot.

“First of all, everybody should be vaccinated and boosted with flu and with COVID ,” he began. “Whether or not you wear a mask — or another thing we shouldn’t underestimate is testing.”

Fauci then urged Americans to get tested the day before attending holiday gatherings, including Thanksgiving, which is two days away.

“So when we’re gathering at a family gathering for Thanksgiving or for Christmas or for any other holiday as we get into the winter, it makes sense that you might want to get a test that day before you come into a place in which you might be infected and spread it, or other people who might be there in order to protect,” he said, identifying masking as “important” but describing “vaccine boosting” and “testing” as “part of the spectrum of protecting yourself.”

Fauci’s remark coincides with the recent plea from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which on Monday urged Americans to get an “updated” shot before the holidays:

The pleas for more vaccinations come despite the fact that the vaccines themselves do not prevent transmission of the virus, nor do they stop the vaccinated individual from contracting it, despite misinformation spread by President Biden last year.

“One last thing that’s really important is: We’re not in a position where we think that any virus — including the Delta virus, which is much more transmissible and more deadly in terms of non — unvaccinated people — the vi- — the various shots that people are getting now cover that,” Biden said during a CNN town hall in July 2021.

“They’re — you’re okay. You’re not going to — you’re not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations,” he claimed.

Biden falsely claimed, months later, that vaccinated individuals “do not spread the disease to anyone else” — yet another falsehood.

The quadruple vaccinated president would go on to contract the virus, despite his previous assertion that vaccinated individuals were covered.

Meanwhile, a report from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is recommending officials to “encourage or mandate” masking to fight against “long COVID,” conveniently after the midterm elections.",COVID
breitbart,COVID,1115,breitbart,"Former National Institutes of Health (NIH) chief Francis Collins, who was also recently appointed as President Joe Biden’s new science advisor, expressed support for vaccine mandates, emphasizing that people’s employment should be threatened.

Leaked audio obtained by The Daily Wire appeared to shatter Collins’ political neutrality, revealing that he not only had a deeply held conviction about the persuasive power of vaccine mandates but also had a particular dislike for former President Donald Trump. The audio originated from an Institute of Politics event on October 26 of last year, which was hosted by Christianity Today theologian Russell Moore at the University of Chicago. Institute of Politics was founded by David Axelrod, an adviser to former President Barack Obama.

After Moore introduced Collins as a personal friend and member of his book club, the talk segued into a discussion about vaccine mandates, during which the former NIH director said that there was “no question” in his “mind that the mandates are legal” and that people should have their employment threatened.

“The US government does have the authority to mandate vaccinations if there is an outbreak that is threatening people, because it’s not just about you, it’s about the people you’re going to infect,” Collins claimed.

Collin said this even though a bevy of evidence showed at the time that the vaccinated could still be infected with the virus and spread it to others.

“Do [mandates] convince people who otherwise wouldn’t get them?” Collins reportedly asked himself rhetorically before answering, “Oh yeah, especially if it means losing your job.”

Collins recalled how he used intimidation tactics at the NIH to push the hesitant employees, approximately 2,000 out of 46,000, into getting the vaccine, telling them they were “in serious danger of being fired in the next month if they [didn’t] do something about it.”

“Reality [was] sinking in,” Collins said, adding that the sudden compliance showed that “their resistance was not maybe quite that deeply seated.”

Collins even argued that some vaccine-hesitant people secretly wanted to get the shot but feared alienating their circle of friends. “They’re sort of thinking to themselves, you know, maybe I really should do it, but if I do, I lose my credibility with my peeps,” Collins said.

The mandates essentially gave such people an excuse, according to Collins.

“‘Well, my employer made me do it. I didn’t really want to get them.’ They get, you know, bonus points, because they’re now a victim. But they’ve also gotten the mandated vaccine that they kind of wanted anyway,” he said.

After knocking Evangelical Christians for emphasizing personal liberty at the expense of personal responsibility, Collins then revealed his partisan side when he blamed the preponderance of coronavirus deaths on former President Trump, ignoring the deaths under Joe Biden.

“Great harm was done to the people in this nation by a very, very self-involved and misguided president in the previous administration. Hundreds of thousands of people have died who should not have had to do so,” Collins said. “And so there was an effort to try to distract from that dreadful circumstance by finding somebody else to blame.”",COVID
breitbart,Climate Change,854,breitbart,"Vulnerable Democrats come out with a separate midterm agenda days before squad member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) delivers a formal response to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address in which she will complain about “moderate” Democrats, the purpose of which is to make them more appealing before voters go to the polls.

Vulnerable Democrats such as Reps. Abigail Spanberger (VA), Steven Horsford (NV), Josh Gottheimer (NJ), Dean Phillips (MN), and Elissa Slotkin (MI) wrote the draft agenda, the New York Times reported. The draft agenda includes approximately 75 bipartisan bills already drafted and broader bullet points to “embrace some of President Biden’s most popular initiatives and tackle rising prices while distancing lawmakers from the left’s most divisive ideas.”

Times stated that the plan from the vulnerable Democrats is meant to underscore attacks from Republicans and to show that the Democrats have been somewhat successful while “Republicans have been at weaponizing issues like pandemic-related school closures and ‘defund the police’ efforts against Democrats in politically competitive districts.”

“The plan avoids other items popular with progressives, such as a $15 minimum wage and a universal, single-payer ‘Medicare for all’ insurance system,” the Times wrote. “But it embraces some of the most broadly popular health care initiatives in Mr. Biden’s now-moribund Build Back Better Act.”

Some of its headline initiatives are not backed by the legislation below those programs. The plan promotes “Combating the Climate Crisis,” for instance, but the bills listed on that topic address the reliability and resilience of the electricity grid, top concerns for climate change deniers. But the agenda’s authors hope to at least revive a sense of momentum in a Democratic Congress that has entered the doldrums since enactment of a $1.2 trillion infrastructure law in November, followed by the Senate’s stymying of House-passed climate and social safety net legislation and a far-reaching voting rights bill. The dozens of bills listed in the agenda all have Democratic and Republican authors, many of them endangered either by anti-Democratic momentum or by challengers endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump.

The report also acknowledges that it was “no accident that the document is circulating just before Mr. Biden’s State of the Union address on March 1, and the following week’s House Democratic ‘issues’ retreat.” Tlaib is slated to give a formal response to Biden. A report from Politico indicated that she will complain about the “moderate” Democrats for not helping pass items from Biden’s legislative agenda.

Democrats have a lot on the line going into the election season while the vulnerable Democrats have to go through a tough election. Still, the battle for which party holds the majority is as essential. The Republicans are poised to take back the House majority since they only need to net five seats. A recent analysis by left-leaning Punchbowl News indicated that House Republicans are slated to pick up at least ten House seats because of Democrat retirements alone.

breitbart,Climate Change,1096,breitbart,"Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) on Monday slammed the Biden administration’s secret oil meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro as a “huge PR boost” for the socialist regime.

“Biden Admin secret meeting with #Maduro was a huge PR boost for #MaduroRegime,” Rubio tweeted after Biden reportedly sought an oil deal with the socialist nation.

“And a demoralizing betrayal of those who have risked everything to oppose Maduro & weren’t even told this was happening,” Rubio continued. “And for what?”

“The amount of oil #Venezuela can produce right now is insignificant,” Rubio said about the estimated 300,000 barrels a day the country’s state oil company produced in 2020.

Biden’s meeting with Maduro is likely a response to American dependence on Russian oil exports, which have been nixed by oil traders, impacting oil prices. Biden has refrained from sanctioning many relevant Russian energy companies in response to the Ukraine invasion:

Instead of supporting American energy independence, Biden is likely seeking a substitute for Russian oil. Russia provided ten percent of global supply last year. “Russia exported about 540,000 barrels a day to the U.S. in 2021, a little under what Venezuela exported to American refineries in 2018 before sanctions shut off the spigot,” the Wall Street Journal reported:

Venezuela faces serious challenges to increasing oil production, said Francisco Monaldi, a Venezuelan who is director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute. There have been no new wells drilled in Venezuela for months, he said, and to reach significant production levels Venezuela would need investments of $12 billion a year for five years. The country that was essential in providing crude to the Allied effort in World War II now pays down debt with oil to China. And Mr. Monaldi said its production is a “drop in the bucket in the world oil market.” “This won’t help ease the pain at the pump for American consumers,” Mr. Monaldi said of the possible lifting of oil sanctions.

breitbart,Climate Change,1198,breitbart,"Two New York State Senate Democrats have apologized for comparing climate change to the terrorist attacks of September 11.

Sen. Rachel May of Syracuse and Sen. Robert Jackson of New York City sparked a whirlwind of criticism on Tuesday when they posed with a banner that featured a plane on a collision course with the World Trade Center alongside the words “Climate Change.” The senators posed for the banner at a rally “outside the state capitol in Albany for supporters who want $15 billion included in the budget for ‘climate justice,'” according to Fox New York.

Photos of the state senators prompted fierce condemnation from Republicans.

“This shameful use of 9/11 imagery offends every New Yorker. My colleagues are using a horrific attack on our Nation to advance their political agenda. The [Democrats] should condemn this disgusting display,” tweeted Senate Republican leader Rob Ortt.

“They should never conflate 9/11 with climate change or, quite frankly, any issue,” Ortt told Fox New York.

Jackson immediately apologized on his Twitter account, claiming he was unaware of what the banner said after posing with multiple activists.

“I did not note the details of the artwork and would never support anything that denigrates the memory of all who were impacted by 9/11. The artwork depicted is wrong and I fully reject it,” he said on Twitter.

“As a NYC native who continues to be personally impacted by the events of that horrific day, I sincerely apologize to anyone who might be confused by any political ploy to mischaracterize my actions,” he continued.

May echoed many of Jackson’s sentiments, saying she “posed for numerous photos with activists, and did not see the content of the sign.”

“The imagery on the banner is unacceptable and I would never endorse such a cynical use of our state’s history to score cheap points,” May said. “I apologize sincerely to all New Yorkers and call upon the organizers to similarly condemn this message.”

While Jackson claims he never saw the banner, footage obtained from Fox New York showed otherwise. At one point, Jackson even repeated the very words on the banner.

“Images from the event showed Jackson addressing the crowd with the banner fully on display behind him,” the outlet noted. “However, after Jackson emailed his statement, Fox 5 News became aware of a video showing Jackson looking directly at the banner, holding a megaphone, and repeating the words that are on it.”

The climate change organization New York Renews originally posted a video of the banner on its Twitter and Facebook, but later removed it.

“We have deleted the video from our accounts so that the image will not be shared further,” the group told Fox. “New York Renews did not invite or sanction this banner and we condemn the use of this imagery.”",Climate Change
breitbart,Climate Change,1098,breitbart,"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg promoted electric cars on Monday as a solution to Americans struggling from high gas prices.

“Clean transportation can bring significant cost savings for the American people as well,” Buttigieg said, touting President Joe Biden’s $5 billion plan to bolster America’s electric charging network.

“So the people from rural, to suburban, to urban communities can all benefit from the gas savings of driving an EV,” he said.

The failed presidential candidate and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, spoke at the White House with Vice President Kamala Harris to promote clean transportation after the average cost of gas spiked over $4 a gallon over the weekend.

During his speech, Buttigieg criticized gas-powered vehicles for their impact on pollution and climate change.

“In our economy, transportation is the single biggest contributor to climate change,” he said disapprovingly.

He promoted the Biden administration’s effort to convert public transit to electric buses and encouraged all Americans to ride buses instead of driving to reduce pollution.

“One of our best tools for doing that is public transit; transit gets riders for where they need to be efficiently and affordably with far less pollution from driving,” he said, asserting that electric buses “don’t pollute at all.”

Since becoming the transportation secretary, Buttigieg has repeatedly urged Americans to purchase electric vehicles to save the climate and save money.

Only nine percent of passenger vehicles sold in the world in 2021 were electric, and only 535,000 electric vehicles were purchased in the United States.

“The people who stand to benefit most from owning an EV are often rural residents, who have the longest distances to drive. They often burn the most gas,” Buttigieg said in a November interview with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart.

The Biden administration has focused intently on heavy subsidies for the electric vehicle industry and making the moral argument that they are superior to gas-powered vehicles.

 In November, President Biden also urged Americans to look at buying an electric vehicle.

“For the hundreds of thousands of folks who bought one of those electric cars, they’re going to save $800 to $1000 in fuel costs this year,” he said.",Climate Change

This is happening … in America.

No, not in America… It’s happening in Joe Biden’s America.

And this is what happens when you give Democrats political power.

You see, above all — unless, of course, you’re an illegal alien — Democrats believe in scarcity.

Less is what Democrats believe in.

Less for everyone.

Less energy, less water, less speech, less housing, and (unless you’re an illegal alien), less baby formula.

The only thing Democrats want more of is gay porn in elementary schools, illegal aliens to replace Americans, Drag Queen Story Hours, and abortions.

“This is a crisis for us in health care,” said Dr. Mark Corkins, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Le Bonheur Children’s Hospital. “This is not every child, not normal children, but literally the formula recall has led to these children requiring hospitalization,” Corkins said. According to Corkins, the children’s bodies did not tolerate the switch to a different formula, when their parents could no longer find the formula they normally use.

Do you not yet understand that this is what Democrats want, to turn America into a third-world country without enough electricity, water, gasoline, and even baby food?

Why else would Democrats kill domestic exploration with energy prices at record highs?

Why else would Democrats kill desalination plants in the middle of California’s devastating drought?

Why else would Democrats try to pass more of the trillion-dollar spending boondoggles that have already resulted in crippling inflation?

Why else would Democrats take power companies offline, knowing there will be blackouts?

Why else would Democrats do absolutely nothing to ensure Americans get enough baby formula when Democrats have known since freakin’ February there would be a shortage?

Please give me a reasonable explanation. I’m all ears. But don’t try “incompetence.” This isn’t incompetence. This is deliberate. No one is stupid enough to stand idle knowing a baby formula shortage is coming. Lenny from Of Mice and Men wouldn’t stand idle if babies were at risk.

Give me a reasonable explanation for why, with energy, housing, and baby formula shortages, Biden is allowing a full-fledged invasion to occur over our southern border.

There is only one explanation… Democrats hate self-reliant, prosperous Americans of all races and creeds and want to punish and replace us.

breitbart,Climate Change,855,breitbart,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) on Thursday called on Congress to pass his legislation that would immediately restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands to combat rising energy prices and boost American energy independence.

“Congress must pass my bill, the SMART Energy Act, that requires President Biden to immediately restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands. We must support America’s energy independence, American energy jobs & American energy production. Especially during these times,” Daines said in a statement.

Daines’s Supporting Made in America Renewable and Traditional (SMART) Energy Act would require Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to hold four onshore oil and gas lease sales in the top seven oil and gas producing states as well as two offshore oil and gas lease sales in both the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska region. The top seven oil and gas producing states are Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Nevada. It would also support the expansion of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands.

Daines’ renewed his push for the SMART Energy Act as Americans continued to grapple with rampant inflation, and energy prices continued to rise after Russia started its assault on Ukraine. Oil topped $100 for the first time in seven years.

Last year, Biden issued a ban on all new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands. Although a federal judge blocked the ban, the Biden administration has yet to hold an oil or gas lease sale in Montana.

Only 24 percent said they strongly agreed that Biden is mentally fit to serve as president. Thirty-four percent strongly believed Biden is not mentally fit to serve as president, a ten-point spread.

Just 18 percent strongly agreed Biden is in good health as commander in chief. Thirty-one percent strongly disagreed with the statement that Biden “is in good health,” a 13-point difference.

Moreover, only 23 percent of voters strongly believe the president of the United States is stable. Thirty-four percent strongly do not believe Biden is stable, an 11-point difference.

The polling comes as Donald Trump’s 2020 prediction that gas prices would reach $7.00 per gallon under Biden came true this week. On Monday, gas prices in California were above $7.00.

The national average gas price on Tuesday reached an all-time high of $4.173, according to AAA.

The gas prices were already $1.00 higher than last year, but with Biden’s perceived weakness around the world, Russia invaded Ukraine, which added to the increase in American energy prices.

A Monday poll revealed 56 percent of Americans blame Biden’s deadly Afghan evacuation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Of the 56 percent who believe Putin’s invasion is linked to Biden’s deadly Afghanistan evacuation, 30 percent of respondents say they “strongly” agree and 26 percent say they “somewhat” agree with the causation.

As Breitbart News previously reported, 50-year-old Wynn Bruce died from injuries he sustained after lighting himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court to raise awareness about climate change:

According to Bruce’s Facebook page, he was a practicing Buddhist performing an act of self-immolation. In the hours following his untimely death, climate activists have taken to social media to hail him as a hero who performed a compassionate act of self-sacrifice.

“Climate activist Wynn Alan Bruce set himself on fire in front of the Supreme Court on Earth Day. He died from this act of self-immolation. Heed his warning. Take climate crisis seriously. End fossil fuels,” tweeted Washington Congressional candidate Rebecca Parson.

breitbart,Climate Change,1269,breitbart,"Former congressman and leading Republican gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday that as governor, he will use all powers available to him to stop illegal immigration, noting that many in the GOP do not have the backbone to stand against the radical left’s illegal immigration policies.

Recent polls show the Republican primary race as very much a two-man battle between himself and State Sen. Doug Mastriano. But with Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf (D) leaving office, Republicans have a clear chance to flip the governor’s mansion. Recent polls, Barletta said, are a “reflection on what we’re seeing on the ground,” as he has a “huge grassroots campaign.”

“People know who I am,” he said, noting that they can look at his record. Many remember the actions he took as the mayor of Hazleton, where he was essentially the first mayor to “stand up and fight against illegal immigration,” and he believes that is the kind of fighter they are looking for again.

“We see so many politicians making campaign promises, and they get in and become part of the problem and disappoint people,” Barletta said. “They want a fighter. They saw me on the national stage as a mayor of a small town and do something that nobody else in the country had the courage to do, and I really do believe that’s part of why we’re in front.”

As mayor, he prioritized fighting sanctuary city policies and the drugs pouring into his city.

“I didn’t talk about it. I actually did something about it,” he said, noting that he was elected in 2000 and watched as the town was “overcome by illegal immigrants.”

“Our population grew by 50 percent, but our tax revenue stayed the same,” he said, describing gangs moving in and recruiting children. Emergency times also increased as illegal aliens used emergency rooms as primary health care. Barletta, at the time, asked for help as violent crime went up.

“I couldn’t find an elected official anywhere in Pennsylvania,” he said, ultimately going to Washington, DC, and meeting with the Department of Justice in 2005. He “begged them for help” but realized “no one there was going to help, either.” Ultimately, Barletta took matters into his own hands and moved to suspend the license of “any business that knowingly hired an illegal alien because it is illegal to hire unlawful workers.” He added, “I would also suspend the license of any landlord who knowingly harbored or rented to illegal aliens.”

As a result, illegals represented by ACLU sued him, and he fought it to the Supreme Court. But many cities across the country followed what he did in Hazleton, and he battled for it in Congress as well.

“Unfortunately for us, I found out that even on our own side, people don’t like to talk about it, but they didn’t have the backbone or courage to do something about it, and look at the mess we have today,” he said, explaining that most politicians do not want to tackle issues regarding immigration because they will be called a racist or bigot. But he said as governor, he will have a lot more power to do something about the issue. Barletta added that he recently called out President Joe Biden, Gov. Tom Wolf (D), and State Attorney General Josh Shapiro over the “ghost flights” of illegals coming in the dead of the night, “dumping them all over Pennsylvania” without any knowledge.

He also noted that fentanyl deaths have hit a record high and “we know the fentanyl is coming from the southern border.” Yet Pennsylvania officials are continuing to allow Biden to dump illegal aliens in the Keystone State.

“That ends when I’m governor of Pennsylvania. I will go after anyone who aids — what I think is human trafficking here into Pennsylvania — dumping people without our knowledge into our communities,” he said. “I’ll go after the buses or anybody that helps relocate people who are illegally being brought into Pennsylvania.”

Barletta also said he will go after every sanctuary city “with every resource that [he has] in [his] power to protect the citizens of Pennsylvania.”

The former congressman also vowed to unleash energy in Pennsylvania as governor, noting that the Russian invasion of Ukraine “highlights Biden’s failure on our energy policy” — a major national security issue, he said.

“And Pennsylvania is the answer to that. We have more energy in Pennsylvania than countries around the world, in the Middle East. We can be a global leader, and we will be when I become governor,” Barletta said, vowing to drop the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

“We’re going to greenlight pipelines when I’m governor. We’re going to reform DEP [Department of Environmental Protection],” which, he said, they used as a weapon to stop natural gas companies.

“Pennsylvania is the answer to our national security issues, and when I’m governor, we’ll be a global leader again,” he promised.",Climate Change
breitbart,Climate Change,3186,breitbart,"President Joe Biden refused Thursday to ask Saudi Arabia to produce more oil to bring down the cost of gasoline in the United States and around the world.

Biden was specifically asked during his press conference in Europe about what he would say to Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about oil during their scheduled meeting in July.

“No, I’m not going to ask them,” he said, noting that he already “indicated” to all the Gulf heads of state his desire for them to produce more oil.

“I hope we see them, in their own interest, concluding that makes sense to do,” Biden said.

Biden argued that his trip to Saudi Arabia was about Middle East peace negotiations with Israel, not the production of oil.

“I’m sure — it’s in Saudi Arabia, but it’s not about Saudi Arabia,” he said. “It’s in Saudi Arabia.”

Biden said he was not even sure he would end up speaking to the Saudi leaders.

“I’m not even sure; I guess I will see the King and the Crown Prince, but that’s — that’s not the meeting I’m going to,” he said. “They’ll be part of a much larger meeting.”

Biden has frequently gone out of his way to criticize Saudi Arabia despite their influence on global oil markets.

During his presidential campaign, Biden vowed to treat Saudi Arabia as a “pariah” but ultimately agreed to a meeting with their leaders in July.

Biden blamed high gas prices around the world on Russia invading Ukraine — even though gas prices in the United States were already rising rapidly before the war began.

“The bottom line is: Ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia,” he said. “Russia, Russia, Russia.”

Biden and his administration continue to pursue anti-fossil fuel policies, putting the country more at the mercy of oil-rich foreign dictators.

When asked how long drivers would be paying for gas, Biden replied, “As long as it takes. So Russia cannot, in fact, defeat Ukraine and move beyond Ukraine.”",Climate Change

Gore’s 2006 film An Inconvenient Truth made him a wealthy man and he won an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, even though his predictions have not panned out.

His latest interview with the left-wing media, which embrace and advance the ideology, was with CBS News on Gore’s 400-acre farm in Tennessee where he has lived during the coronavirus pandemic and where he leaves the toil to others.

CBS News asked Gore if people think of him as a farmer.

“I don’t think so and truth to tell, I don’t have many calluses on my hands either,” Gore said.

“His team handles most of the farm work, tending to the sheep and raising the animals that help fertilize the land where they are growing everything from carrots and beets to a variety of greens,” CBS News reported.

CBS reported that Gore’s farm is his “climate change laboratory:”

“There are better ways to plant,” Gore said.

CBS’s glowing report on Gore included advancing the idea the weather can be controlled by human practices and time is running out:

Gore says Mother Nature is now making the most effective argument for climate action, and he is encouraged by the rapid growth of solar and wind power and people buying electric vehicles in record numbers. But the planet is still rapidly warming as we continue to pump near-record amounts of pollution into the sky, leading scientists to declare a code red for humanity.

“Job number one is to stop using the sky as an open sewer for all this man-made global warming pollution,” Gore said. “That’s what’s making the weather crazy and dangerous—leading to all of the consequences that are on the TV news almost every night now.” Gore went on:

A realist will tell you ‘Look, we’ve done some damage, some of it regrettably is not recoverable.’ But we go from where we are. You want to avoid tipping people into despair because some people go from denial to despair without pausing at the intermediate step of actually doing something about it.

“This crisis is still getting worse faster than we’re deploying the solutions,” Gore said. “There is a remaining question about whether we can solve it in time.”

“The more they march, the more noise they can make, the more demands they insist upon, the faster progress we’ll make. I’m a firm believer in that,” Gore said.",Climate Change
breitbart,Economy,372,breitbart,"The Washington Post editorial board on Thursday endorsed the idea of banning lawmakers from trading individual stocks.

While lawmakers have reportedly bought and sold nearly $290 million throughout 2021 in equities alone, the paper owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos announced it opposes lawmakers, their spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, calling it “easy to understand — and implement”:

Senators and representatives receive a substantial amount of information that the public does not, including details about how U.S. companies operate and how the government scrutinizes businesses. The fact that so much congressional stock trading goes on — with thousands of stocks traded each year by members of both parties — raises legitimate questions about whether lawmakers are using their access to that information to enrich themselves, rather than to serve the public.

The Post questioned what should be done about stocks previously bought before the lawmakers assumed office. “And what about stocks purchased before a member is elected? Should those have to be sold or is it sufficient to put them in a blind trust?” it wrote.

The paper also pointed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) as a “roadblock to the ban” and noted “[h]er husband, Paul, has been a frequent trader over the years”:

Last month, Ms. Pelosi stunned many, including this editorial board, when she defended congressional stock trading. She argued it’s enough that lawmakers have to disclosure their trades for the public to see. In reality, 54 members of Congress failed to disclose their trades on time in the past two years, according to an Insider investigation.

On Thursday, Pelosi changed her mind and told reporters she is open to banning members from trading stocks. “I just don’t buy into it, but if members want to do that I’m OK with that,” Pelosi said.

 “We’re a free-market economy,” Pelosi said December 16. “They [lawmakers] should be able to participate in that.”

The Post’s endorsement of banning congressional stock trades comes as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) is reportedly weighing a ban on congressional stock trading if he wins the speaker’s gavel in November. Several bills have been written to facilitate the ban, though fresh bills would need to be refreshed when the next Congress takes office.

He also claimed that inflation at the grocery store was “down slightly,” even though the cost of food at home is up 12.4 percent from the previous year.

breitbart,Economy,1541,breitbart,"Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA) has submitted document preservation notices to twelve individuals from the intelligence community, White House, Facebook, and Twitter — as Republicans in Congress are gearing up to take back majorities and investigate election interference with regard to the suppression of the “Laptop From Hell” series in October 2020.

Rep. Issa is demanding former DNI boss James Clapper, former CIA boss Micheal Hayden, former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, former CIA head John Brennan, former top CIA aide Nick Shapiro, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Meta Communications Director Andy Stone, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal all preserve documents relating to their involvement in suppressing the New York Post’s bombshell exposé on the Hunter Biden laptop in the lead up to the 2020 presidential election, according to letters obtained exclusively by Breitbart News.

The news comes as Breitbart News exclusively reported Wednesday that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) announced House Republicans had sent dozens of preservation notices across the federal government to agencies and departments throughout Biden administration, ordering them to preserve documents in anticipation of eventual subpoenas from House Republicans after the 2022 midterm elections.

The letters from Issa to the various characters begin similarly, demanding the recipient “immediately initiate document preservation for all materials relating to questions, inquiry, conversation, strategy, and response, from 2020 to current, to the media reporting of the Hunter Biden laptop and/or its contents that first appeared in the New York Post on October 14, 2020.”

The notices state the recipient should “[construe the request] as an instruction to preserve all documents, communications, and other information, including electronic information and metadata, that is or may be potentially responsible to this congressional inquiry,” including electronic messages, text messages, or communications on encrypted software sent from official or personal devices.

Issa adds in his letters that the information will be “essential for Congress to conduct a comprehensive fact-finding investigation into the actions by technology companies, media organizations, and political allies to suppress information and prevent public awareness of matters involving the Biden Family.”

Rep. Issa told Breitbart News in a statement that he is putting those who participated in the effort to suppress the laptop from hell “on notice” and that he will be taking up the role of a watchdog when Republicans take a majority in the House in November.

“Big Tech, the mainstream media and the Democrats’ deep state intelligence community want to either rewrite the history of their collusion – or erase it entirely. We’re not going to let them do that,” Issa said in a statement to Breitbart News.

“These letters are putting everyone on notice: real accountability is going to happen. And we won’t rest until the full truth is known.”

The letters come as Republicans anticipate taking back power in Congress, and in the wake of the New York Times becoming just the latest legacy outlet to admit that the Laptop and reporting on its contents were authentic and accurate — despite broad, unsubstantiated, and false claims at the time that the report was “Russian disinformation.”

When the original Post stories were reported in October 2020, the security state, the media, Big Tech, and the Democratic Party worked in machine-like coordination to suppress the information.

Big Tech immediately shut down the ability to share the Post link to the story and suspended accounts attempting to do so — claiming to be curbing “misinformation.”

Five days after the first story was published, Politico obtained and reported on a letter signed by “more than 50 former senior intelligence officials” claiming the Post’s reporting “has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,” despite zero evidence for the claim, which, evidently, was false.

Now-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki immediately amplified the narrative set by the former spies, tweeting out the Politico story that same day.

Then, when former-President Trump confronted then-candidate Joe Biden about the contents of the report days later at the presidential debate, Biden claimed, “there are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant. … Five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage.”

Following the election in November of 2020, McLaughlin & Associates released a poll showing that 36% of Biden voters were not aware of the Laptop exposé and that “13% of those said they would not have voted for Biden had they known.”

“Such a shift away from Biden would have meant President Trump would have won the election with 289 electoral votes,” the pollsters concluded.

GOP lawmakers’ move to dismantle the corporate carveout comes after Disney CEO Bob Chapek pledged to oppose the state’s the Parental Rights in Education Law, and the embattled entertainment brand is openly pushing LGBTQIA+ content to young audiences.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) signed legislation into law Friday intended to dissolve Disney’s special tax and governing jurisdiction in Florida. GOP lawmakers’ move to dismantle the corporate carveout comes after Disney CEO Bob Chapek pledged to oppose the state’s the Parental Rights in Education Law, and the embattled entertainment brand is openly pushing LGBTQIA+ content to young audiences.

The legislation DeSantis signed would eliminate the Reedy Creek Improvement District, which has existed for 55 years as a vehicle for Disney to govern itself within the state. Florida established Disney’s special tax district in 1967 after Walt Disney asked the Florida Legislature for more control over the development of Walt Disney World.

Disney has paid taxes and fees to the Reedy Creek district since its creation, and in exchange, the district provides governmental services for Disney World, including emergency medial services, road maintenance, electric power, and other public safety services.

The Reedy Creek district, along with several other similarly situated special tax districts, will be dissolved effective June 1, 2023. However, the law allows the districts to be reestablished in the future, which could happen after further negotiation.

After Florida passed the Parental Rights in Education Law, which prohibits certain grade school teachers from talking about sexuality in the classroom, Chapek said Disney’s goal “is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.”

DeSantis called Disney for being a California-based corporation that is butting its head into Florida politics at the bill’s signing.

“You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re gonna marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state. We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that,” said DeSantis.

“You know, you did have the issue with our Parents Rights and Education bill…for whatever reason, Disney got on that bandwagon, they demagogued it, they lied about it,” DeSantis added.

DeSantis’ signature on the bill comes after the Florida legislature moved quickly on the measure to repeal Disney’s special tax status. The Florida state House voted 70-38 in favor of the bill after the state Senate voted 23-16 to approve the measure.

Once the dissolution is finalized in 2023, Florida’s Orange and Osceola counties would absorb Reedy Creek’s debt, which is reportedly around $1 billion.

“The moment that it dissolves, that money’s gone. Just gone. And instead, what happens is all the debts and obligations of Reedy Creek get transferred over to Orange County government,” said Scott Randolph, Orange County tax collector.",Economy

Skinner told Breitbart News. “And at the end of the day, the people who get the most hurt are everyday consumers and everyday taxpayers who are footing the bill for a political money game.”

At the center of the Shady Trial Lawyer Pipeline is AAJ PAC, an organization tied to the American Association for Justice, a trial lawyers advocacy group. AAJ PAC, the Truth and Justice Fund Company, and various Justice PACs, are closely tied to plaintiff-side trial firms fueled by money the firms get from contracts with state or local governments.

Alliance for Consumer’s previous report focused on the “shady eight” law firms that donated $15 million to pro-Democrat groups after securing contracts with state governments.

Between 2017 to 2022, these Shady Trial Lawyers PACs reportedly donated $17.5 million on behalf of Democrat organizations, with $2 million spent in the last 15 months alone.

“One hundred percent of the independent expenditures that they recorded with the FEC went in support of Democratic candidates for the US Senate. Ninety-nine percent of the overall money went to left wing committees, Democratic committees,” Skinner said. “And to locate where that money went is equally as telling.”

The PACs’ money went to far-left groups like America Votes, which prides itself as “the coordination hub of the progressive community.” The abortion advocacy group Emily’s List also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Shady Trial Lawyer PACs.

Another beneficiary of the PAC is the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which is led by former President Barack Obama’s former Attorney General, Eric Holder. Finally, the Shady Trial Lawyer PACs reportedly donated more than half a million dollars to Priorities USA Action, a nonprofit organization that focuses on mobilizing progressive voters.

“Ninety-nine percent of the money goes to democratic causes, left wing causes, super ideological causes, that would really be, I think, offensive and upsetting to your everyday consumer, your everyday citizen who’s getting a bad deal and probably doesn’t have values that align with where this money’s going,” Skinner said.

“This partisan political giving is supported by law firms that hold lucrative public contracts and get big money as a result, money that really belongs in the pockets of taxpayers and consumers,” the report said.

Consumers and taxpayers are harmed by the one-sided nature of these contracts between governments and law firms. As Skinner explained to Breitbart News, most of these contracts do not protect state governments and can lead to a state being usurped by a left-leaning city that provides the law firm a better deal.

So sometimes these law firms can get a contract that says, any settlement that relates to prescription drugs, you know something very broad, we get paid, even if the law firm doesn’t work on the case, even if the attorney general or whoever it is, finds a way to get money coming back to the state because the company did something wrong and the law firm wasn’t involved.

“So the punch line is there’s long, there’s these contracts that cover millions and millions of dollars, and they have no end date,” he added. “You don’t have conflicts protections to make sure that the state isn’t getting taken advantage of if the law firm has a city or a town like a leftwing city.”",Economy
breitbart,Economy,4565,breitbart,"Democrats in control of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee released six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns on Friday, an unprecedented intrusion that revealed nothing in particular.

The release marked the first time Congress had ever obtained and published the tax returns of any individual.

Trump had resisted calls to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election, saying that they were under audit. He was also reluctant to give political ammunition to his rivals. (In 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) claimed that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had not paid taxes for years, a claim that was given credibility by the media but had no basis in fact.)

Democrats speculated that Trump must have been hiding something, and fantasized about what his returns might show. But when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow published a 2005 tax return showing he paid $38 million in income taxes, she was widely mocked.

In 2019, the New York Times claimed to have obtained “decades” of Trump’s tax returns. Though the paper reported that he shown “chronic losses and years of tax avoidance,” it could find nothing illegal or untoward.

The Times story, if based on authentic documents, appears to debunk several conspiracy theories held by Democrats for years. The tax returns do not “any previously unreported connections to Russia,” the Times reports. Moreover, the Times story appears to confirm Trump’s claim — long treated as an excuse by Democrats — that he is under audit by the IRS. And the Times could not find “any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen,” ostensibly the subject of the New York investigation [into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels].

Nevertheless, Democrats tried to use their majority on the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, to force Trump to release his returns, though there was no real legislative purpose in doing so.

Trump resisted the committee’s efforts in the courts, until finally losing at the Supreme Court, which allowed the Committee to compel the IRS to turn over the tax returns of Trump, now a private citizen.

The House Ways and Means Committee released the returns just days before Democrats formally lose their majority in the House of Representatives — and, with it, majority control of the various House committees.

The six years of newly-released returns, covering the years 2015 through 2020, show that Trump paid a total of $4.4 million in federal income taxes over that period, with an adjusted gross income of -$53.2 million. “The Trumps paid some form of federal taxes every year, but they reported income-tax liability of $750 or less in three of the six years,” the Wall Street Journal noted. Democrats point to some potential problems. They claim that Trump’s tax returns as president were not properly audited by the IRS (a claim the IRS disputes). They also complained about charitable deductions and whether loans to his children should have been taxed as income.

However, there appeared to be few bombshells. In a statement on Truth Social, his social media platform, the former president said the returns showed “how proudly successful I have been” and warned that “the Democrats should never have done it.”

Republicans echoed the latter sentiment, saying the release of the tax returns seemed to have a purely political motive, and opened the door for Republicans to do the same in future.

breitbart,Economy,3087,breitbart,"Disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti entered a guilty plea on Thursday in a California federal court on wire fraud and tax-related charges.

Avenatti, who represented himself during the criminal proceedings, changed his plea from “not guilty” to “guilty” on four counts of wire fraud and one count of obstructing the administration of the Internal Revenue Code.

He entered his guilty plea despite not reaching a deal with federal prosecutors, meaning he could be sentenced to the statutory maximum of 83 years in prison.

United States District Judge James Selna set Avenatti’s sentencing for September 19, but that could be vacated if federal prosecutors decide to go forward with 31 other counts he is facing.

The decision on whether prosecutors will go forward with the remaining counts is expected next week. The additional charges include multiple wire fraud, bank fraud, bankruptcy fraud, aggravated identity theft, and tax charges.

On the four counts of wire fraud, Avenatti admitted he embezzled money from his legal clients by misappropriating their money and lying about receiving it or falsely claiming he sent it to them already.

Avenatti also admitted that he “corruptly obstructed and impeded the IRS’s efforts to collect unpaid payroll taxes,” which the federal government estimates to be about $5 million.

Avenatti will reportedly have to pay $1 million in fines and $14 million in restitution. In court on Thursday, Avenatti reportedly told the judge he “misappropriated and misused” client funds and “acted corruptly” in his dealings with the IRS.

“The financial investigation conducted by the IRS details a man who allegedly failed to meet his obligations to the government, stole from his clients, and used his ill-gotten gains to support his racing team, the ownership of Tully’s coffee shops, and a private jet,” the IRS’s Acting Special Agent in Charge Ryan L. Korner said after a grand jury indicted Avenatti on the charges in 2019.

Avenatti is currently serving four years in California federal prison after a jury found him guilty of stealing book proceeds from his former client, porn star Stormy Daniels. He was also sentenced to 30 months in federal prison after he was found guilty of extorting Nike.

The State Bar of California has already suspended Avenatti’s license to practice law due to his criminal conduct.

breitbart,Economy,4243,breitbart,"Globalization of the United States economy has had a crippling impact on American towns as free trade makes it easier for companies to move production and jobs overseas, a report from the U.S. International Trade Commission details.

The report, which assembled union representatives, economists, and others to discuss the impact of decades-long U.S. free trade policy, was requested by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and conducted in March and April of this year.

Among other findings, the report found that U.S. free trade policy has allowed companies to more readily move American jobs overseas and keep wages low for jobs that remain in the U.S.

“Participants identified trade policy as the cause of job losses. One union representative noted that trade policies often have loopholes or are manipulated by China and other countries so that the policies are not operating as intended,” the report states:

When U.S. free trade policy enables companies to offshore production, the report states, American employees are not the only ones directly impacted by such moves. Towns and communities as a whole, along with Americans in supporting industries, feel the devastating impact as well.

“Participants noted that, when jobs are lost, local businesses — such as gas stations and restaurants — that rely on affected workers as customers and clients, as well as other businesses in the industry’s supply chain, suffer as a result,” the report states. “A retired steelworker also noted that company bankruptcies can have effects beyond job loss, such as lost pensions.”

Societal impacts as a result of companies offshoring U.S. production, the report finds, include rising mental health issues, suicide, lower life expectancy, divorce, domestic violence, higher crime rates, and worse off public schools.

In particular, when a plant closed in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, the report states, because of U.S. free trade policy, neighboring mom-and-pop shops, local businesses, and grocery stores suffered tremendously to stay afloat. Many ended up closing as well.

“Another union representative noted that, when General Motors Company shut down production in Lansing, Michigan, jobs throughout the local community suffered as a result,” the report states:

Two other union representatives spoke about the impact of plant closures and production cutbacks on employees. An academic and a business owner reported that plant closures can lead to the loss of opportunity for upward career mobility and a shift to services jobs that tend to have lower wages and fewer benefits. Other union representatives, including one who is retired, said that the closure of the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019, and the threat of offshoring has been used to suppress worker wages and benefits. Another union representative spoke about Cooper Tire in Finley, Ohio, which reportedly faced competition from dumped imports from China in 2007. Employees at this facility were reportedly scheduled for shifts that were two days on and two days off and could not file for unemployment. [Emphasis added]

In Rep. Tim Ryan’s northeast Ohio district, nearly 25,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost over the last two decades. At the same time, drug overdose deaths in the area have skyrocketed by 400 percent in some communities.

“A retired union representative said that families and neighborhoods in the Mahoning Valley and Youngstown, Ohio, are still being affected by manufacturing job losses that occurred over 40 years ago, as well as more recent plant closures,” the report states. “She described a cycle of decline, decay, and blight, as the population has dropped to one-third of its previous size and homes lay vacant as children and grandchildren move away.”

The economic and social decay of Ryan’s district is partially why Ohio’s Senator-elect J.D. Vance explained to Breitbart News last month that tariffs on foreign imports must be the center of the nation’s industrial policy to “rebuild the industrial heartland of America.”

Offshoring, spurred by U.S. free trade policy, is not letting up.

This month, for example, executives with technology parts manufacturer Jabil Inc. announced that they would be laying off about 1,400 of their American employees in California and closing six plants across the state.

Similarly, a 125-year-old plant Avon plant in Suffern, New York is shuttering and laying off nearly 140 of its American employees. Avon executives said those U.S. jobs will be sent to Brazil and Poland where the price of labor is substantially lower.

Also this month, medical device company Vapotherm announced that it is closing its Exeter, New Hampshire manufacturing plant, laying off nearly 50 of its American employees, and sending production to low-wage Tijuana, Mexico.

Executives with Norcold, the refrigerator manufacturer, are laying off nearly 360 of their American employees at two Shelby County, Ohio plants and sending all production to foreign countries.

breitbart,Economy,552,breitbart,"The “modern Republican” Party is scrapping its old-guard corporate ties and business special interests, an Axios report details, as Breitbart News and small-dollar donors to former President Trump steer the party’s future.

Fourteen of the top GOP consultants and operatives detail how the Republican Party has shifted away from the Chamber of Commerce, the Koch brothers’ network of donor class organizations, National Review, and economic libertarian groups toward Trump’s small-dollar donors, populist-nationalist outlets like Breitbart News, and Tucker Carlson.

These days, it is Trump’s voters, Breitbart News readers, and Carlson viewers that Republicans hope to win over in elections rather than seeking out corporate campaign contributions through endorsements from the Heritage Foundation, FreedomWorks, and the Senate Conservatives Fund.

“You don’t want Breitbart on your ass,” a GOP operative told Axios.

J.D. Vance, the New York Times best-selling author now running for Senate in Ohio, said the party’s shift comes as beltway conservative orthodoxy has been busted through by the likes of Trump, Breitbart News, and Carlson.

“We all owe Donald Trump a great deal for singlehandedly destroying the corrupt globalist and corporatist orthodoxies that previously defined the Republican Party, in favor of a new Republican Party, that is pro-worker and always puts America first,” Vance told Breitbart News.

That shift seeks to increasingly align Republican lawmakers and those running for office with the nation’s largest voting bloc: economic populists who are socially conservative.

The Republican Party’s connections to the Chamber, while financially still tied, have faded dramatically in recent election years.

“If the U.S. Chamber of Commerce calls you and says ‘We want to endorse,’ You’re like, ‘Please don’t,'” a high-profile GOP political consultant told Axios. Most recently, the Chamber urged President Joe Biden and Congress to double legal immigration levels and provide amnesty to the nation’s 11 to 22 million illegal aliens.

Last year, the Chamber’s political action committee (PAC) donated thousands to Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Todd Young (R-IN), John Thune (R-SD), and Mike Lee (R-UT), as well as to Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-FL), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), Maria Salazar (R-FL), and Don Bacon (R-NE), among others.

The same goes for the Koch network.

Whereas Republicans once vied for campaign cash from the Kochs, major backers of mass immigration and job-killing free trade, candidates try to steer clear of the network while running against open borders and in support of industrial policy to reshore America’s manufacturing base.

“… none of the operatives we interviewed considered Koch support to be important in 2022,” the Axios report notes.

For the 2022 midterms, nearly 100 Republican lawmakers have accepted donations from the Koch Industries PAC, including Reps. Liz Cheney (R-WY), Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Don Bacon (R-NE), Tony Gonzalez (R-TX), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), Ashley Hinson (R-IA), Julia Letlow (R-LA), Jackie Walorski (R-IN), Garret Graves (R-LA), Jim Banks (R-IN), Byron Donalds (R-FL), Yvette Herrell (R-NM), and Jim Jordan (R-OH), among others.

A new wave of Republicans, though, are fiercely breaking all ties with the old guard.

Andrew McCarthy, running in New York’s 24th congressional district, told Breitbart News that he, Joe Kent, running in Washington’s 3rd congressional district, and Anthony Sabatini, running in Florida’s 7th congressional district, are just a handful of some of the new blood campaigning to offer voters an “America First approach to policy” with teeth.

“You’re getting policy that is untainted and untouched by these beltway, second-tier groups,” McCarthy said. The shift, he said, can be seen in endorsements that long-established groups like the Club for Growth have recently made.

In Alabama, the Club for Growth is backing Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) — an avid opponent of mass immigration — for Senate. In Arizona, the organization just endorsed Blake Masters for Senate. Masters’ central issue is advocating for domestic economic policy that ensures working- and middle-class Americans can support their families on a single income.

Patrick Witt, running in Georgia’s 10th congressional district, told Breitbart News that the shift is a “recognition that beltway conservatives hide behind free market ideology while supporting anti-free market practices.” Big Tech, Witt said, is just one example.

“Those are not free markets. Those are monopolies.”

On the campaign trail, Witt said Republican primary voters are not interested in endorsements from beltway think tanks. Voters, he said, want fighters for their economic and social interests.

“The Republican Party needs a big wake-up call if they think big business is their friend,” Witt said. “It is often an enemy of social conservatism. The wake-up call is long overdue.”

In Congress, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has embodied the shift. He is currently trying to get conservative lawmakers on board with plans to break up giant tech conglomerates with vigorous antitrust enforcement. Last month, Hawley introduced a bill to ban members of Congress from trading stocks.

Likewise, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) made headlines in 2020 when he vowed never to take donations from corporate-funded PACs. Hawley and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) have since followed.

The shift is not just occurring in Washington, D.C.

At the state level, Republican legislators and governors are charting a similar course. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), for instance, has laid out an ambitious legislative agenda that includes blacklisting companies from receiving state licenses if they are found to facilitate illegal immigration.

In West Virginia last year, Delegate Riley Keaton led a group of the state’s House delegates in demanding Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) oppose immigration provisions included in Biden’s Build Back Better Act.

Their focus: Mass immigration boosts corporate profits at the expense of Americans.

“Amnesty for illegal immigrants redistributes wealth from working class Americans through increased economic competition,” they wrote. “Academic research has found, time and again, that immigration, especially illegal immigration, has a direct, negative impact on the Americans we should be trying to help get ahead — the working class.”

breitbart,Economy,2558,breitbart,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) doubled down on Friday, warning that the state will not “subsidize” Disney’s “corporate speech” and vowed that the woke company “is not going to have its own government in Florida.”

Speaking at a press conference, where he announced the biggest tax relief package in the state’s history, DeSantis pointed to other wins the state has racked up, including “leading the effort in the country to make sure that our school system is for education, not for indoctrination.”

“That involves things like making sure every parent in Florida has the right to access the curriculum that’s being used in their kid’s school,” he said, explaining that the far-left has fought against his administration on that issue:

We want to make sure that we’re focusing on teaching kids to get the right answer and not being diverted by ideologies and other type of stuff that really isn’t pertinent in any of this. And then obviously we believe, you know, parents have the right to send their kids to like kindergarten without having a lot of this sexual content injected into the curriculum. And, you know, I think parents overwhelmingly agree with that.

“There’s one company that’s headquartered in Burbank, California that didn’t agree with that,” he said, referencing his administration’s war with Disney and making it clear that “we run this state, they do not run this state.”

“We’re going to do what’s right for parents,” he said, adding that it is “not the responsibility of Florida citizens to subsidize your corporate speech.”

As a result, the legislature took action to dissolve Disney’s special taxing district, sparking outcry from leftists.

“At the end of the day, Disney is not going to have its own government in Florida,” he vowed. “Disney is going to have to live under the same laws that everybody else lives under in Florida.”

“Disney will pay its fair share of taxes, and Disney is going to be responsible for all the debt it has racked up. That will happen. Anyone that tells you differently is not being honest about it,” he said, adding that they will outline the proposals in the “coming weeks and months.”

Disney has continued to pay the price, literally, for making it clear that it does not respect parental rights, as Walt Disney Co. lost nearly $63 billion in market capitalization since coming out against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, which protects children in kindergarten through third grade from classroom discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity.",Economy
breitbart,Economy,1110,breitbart,"Nearly one in three (30 percent) of Americans drove less in February, with the majority of those citing President Joe Biden’s high gas prices as the cause for less time on the road, a Monday Morning Consult poll revealed.

While about 85 percent of Americans commute to work by car, 57 percent of Americans who drove less in February did so because of the high price of gas. Thirty-three percent said they utilized their cars less because their routine was different. Fourteen percent cited “other” reasons.

Overall, 53 percent said they drove the same amount of time in February. Only nine percent said they drove more.

The poll comes as the price of gas per gallon has reached more than $4.00 amid inflationary pressures. Breitbart News reported:

West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the U.S. benchmark, rose as high as $130.50 a barrel before retreating to $123.09. WTI’s highest price since 1983 was $143.67 in 2008. Adjusted for inflation that would be $186.73. Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, traded as high as $139.13 on Sunday evening. By 8:45 P.M. EST, Brent was down to $126.30. Oil prices have risen on fears of a full embargo against Russian oil, which accounted for about 10 percent of the global supply before the invasion of Ukraine. As well, many in the market are refusing to bid, ship, or unload Russian oil, pushing up demand for other sources. The Russian benchmark, known as Urals, has traded at a steep discount to Brent over the past week.

Meanwhile, Biden reportedly sent a delegation to meet Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro to discuss buying Venezuelan oil. Venezuela is likely perceived by Biden as a source for oil to replace Russia’s energy supply to the West.

Biden seems to prefer purchasing oil from socialist Venezuela to ramping up domestic oil supply from American producers. America’s dependence on foreign oil contributed to the $1.00 per gallon gas price increase over Biden’s first year as president.

Kelly voted in favor of a bill dubbed the “American Rescue Act” early last year. Since its passage, economists have noted that the bill is one of the driving forces behind inflation. Even economists associated with the Democrat party have noted that the American Rescue Plan has had disastrous effects.

Jason Furman, a Harvard economist who previously chaired the White House Council of Economic Advisors for the Obama administration, called the bill the “original sin” that drove inflation. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) also warned that the Biden administration’s spending could cause increased inflation

While Kelly is on the board of the Joint Economic Committee, he responded to concerns about inflation by saying that he is an “engineer, not an economist.”

Now, Phoenix, Arizona, is facing rampant inflation. The Phoenix metro area experienced a whopping 11 percent inflation rate between April 2021 and April 2022.

The surge in prices has led some swing voters in the Grand Canyon State to lean towards the Republican Party in the upcoming midterm elections. Jillian Birnbaum, a 37-year-old nurse and mother of two is an independent who says that she is considering voting for the Republican Party because of the high costs of living.

Birnbaum told the Wall Street Journal, “There must be some reason for why it’s happening with this administration and not the last one.” The independent voter also remarked, “We are giving out money like it’s growing on trees,” citing the federal government’s spending as a driving factor of inflation.

Mark Kelly will face off against Trump-endorsed Senate candidate Blake Masters in November.

breitbart,Election,4070,breitbart,"Anti-war protesters challenged far-left “squad” member Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) during a town hall event on Thursday in Richfield, Minnesota, for helping to send billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine.

“Both parties are for war, so what difference does it make?” one protester asked the congresswoman, to which she replied claiming to be “anti-war” and suggesting the man vote for independent candidates if he is displeased with the two-party system.

“$80 billion to Ukraine is not anti-war,” the protester replied, before accusing Ukraine of “killing its own citizens.”

“We are helping people survive war,” Omar said while shaking her finger. “We are helping little children like me that haven’t been helped—”

Omar began to shout at the man about “millions of Ukrainians that have been displaced” and “piles of bodies that are being found in mass graves.”

“There are little children whose lives are being lost,” she continued to shout. “You can sit here and talk, but unless you are someone like me that has been that child, you do not get to tell me what my votes mean and how I get to vote in supporting people who desperately need support right now.”

Omar attempted to call on another town hall attendee, but the protester interrupted, yelling, “The United States started this war.”

“It is sad and dangerous for you to a say a war that has been waged by Russia was started by the U.S.,” she replied, later telling the man, “I hope that you find the help that you need.”

Omar is not the only “squad” member to receive backlash for sending money to Ukraine — much of which, research has noted, is ending up in the hands of highly powerful and well-connected Defense Department contractors such as Raytheon Technologies.

Two constituents confronted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) in mid-October for voting to send billions in American taxpayer money to fund the war in Ukraine against Russia, which some say could potentially provoke nuclear war.

Ocasio-Cortez could be heard suggesting that there is “a line” between being an anti-war proponent and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to which a man responded: “There is no line because this is bullshit. None of this matters if we’re all dead. None of it. You know that.”

Congress has so far appropriated $65 billion in military and economic aid to Ukraine since the conflict between Russia and the embattled nation began. Congress as recently as September allocated $12 billion in aid to Ukraine in a stopgap spending bill to continue funding the government through December. NBC News reported last week that Congress is now pursuing a roughly $50 billion Ukraine aid package.",Election
breitbart,Election,4358,breitbart,"Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY) announced over the weekend that he has “seriously” considered the pleas to run for Republican National Committee (RNC) chair and will announce his decision on December 7, after the Georgia runoff election.

“I’ve been seriously considering your requests to run for RNC Chair. I will announce my decision at 8am EST on December 7th, waiting until Wednesday to keep the focus on the Georgia runoff,” the former New York gubernatorial candidate said, urging those in the Peach State to get out and vote for Republican Herschel Walker:

Reports first surfaced of Zeldin’s consideration last month following the conclusion of the Empire State’s gubernatorial race. While he failed to unseat Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY), his efforts helped trigger a host of victories for other Republicans across the state, which ultimately helped Republicans secure a majority in the U.S. House. And, despite his loss, it was still one of the closest gubernatorial race in two decades:

In mid-November, Zeldin’s media consultant, John Brabender, affirmed that the Republican was “fielding calls” and “talking to people” in regards to running for RNC chair. However, at the time, Brabender said it had not gone beyond that.

Shortly after, reports surfaced, indicating that RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel planned to seek reelection to her current position. She has served as chairwoman since 2017.

Last month, Zeldin sent a letter out to committee members, emphasizing the need for the Republican Party to “to retool, transform, win back the Presidency in 2024, expand our number of Republican held seats in Congress, and elect the maximum number of down ballot races across the country.”

“The Republican Party needs to be all in to do everything in its power to save America,” he said, adding:

Not only should the Republican Party compete in all 50 states, and ensure we are driving up turnout within our base, but we also need to go to all communities no matter how blue they are, show up often, build relationships, and advance our proposals on education, upward economic mobility, housing, mental health, public safety, and more.

“This means making sure people know what we stand for, and not just what we are against,” Zeldin wrote.

Zeldin’s announcement will come roughly a week after the announcement of the Republican Party Advisory Council, which will closely examine the Republican Party’s relatively lackluster performance in the 2022 midterm elections.",Election
breitbart,Election,2482,breitbart,"Special Counsel John H. Durham won a victory Wednesday when a federal judge in Washington, DC, agreed to compel the production of documents that Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign said were protected by attorney-client privilege.

Durham is prosecuting former Clinton lawyer Michael Sussmann for lying to the FBI when he claimed to be acting as a private citizen in providing false information purporting to link then-candidate Donald Trump to the Russian government via Alfa Bank.

As the New York Post noted earlier in the week:

In court papers filed last month, Durham said the Democratic National Committee, Hillary for America, the Fusion GPS research company and the powerhouse Perkins Coie law firm — where Sussmann was formerly a partner — “have all withheld and/or redacted documents and communications” that could potentially be used against the defendant.” Durham said they made that decision “based on an apparent theory that political opposition research and/or public relations work … falls within the legitimate scope of attorney-client privilege and work-product protections.” “They have done so despite the fact that almost all of these materials appear to lack any connection to actual or expected litigation or the provision of legal advice,” members of Durham’s team wrote.

In that motion, Durham argued that the documents he sought were crucial to demonstrating the relationship between Sussmann and others, even if the substance of the documents were to be redacted.

On Wednesday, a federal judge agreed, according to legal blogger Techno_Fog:

The court will review the documents “in camera” — that is, behind closed doors — before deciding whether they must be turned over to the prosecution and possibly admitted into evidence during the trial, which starts in earnest later this month.

The court will only review 38 documents of 1,500 over which the defendants and their associates have asserted privilege, according to the Washington Examiner. However, others could be introduced in future trials, the prosecution said:

It remains to be seen how the judge will rule on the privilege claims after taking a look at the Alfa Bank-related documents. Thirty are internal Fusion emails, and eight relate to [tech executive Rodney] Joffe and Fusion. The judge asked Durham prosecutor Jonathan Algor whether Durham would come back for the other 1,500 documents if the judge ended up agreeing with the prosecution about these 38 records. Algor said “not for this trial” but left the door open for the future, saying that “Your Honor’s decision is important” for the investigation. Clinton campaign lawyer Robert Trout argued, “The government here has an erroneously cramped view of privilege” and called it a “false choice” to say something is either opposition research or covered by privilege. He said, “It is true that Donald Trump was an opposition candidate” but claimed Fusion had been hired to help with legal advice for the campaign. He said: “It may have been research about an opposition candidate, but the real purpose was to get our facts straight.”

The judge said that while some of the work done by Fusion GPS might have been legal in nature, the opposition research did not qualify, and therefore some of the documents would have to be reviewed.

Five Hillary Clinton associates are already expected to assert their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in the trial, in which prosecutors have alleged a “conspiracy” to invent the idea that Trump colluded with Russia, and to plant it in the media and feed it to law enforcement.

breitbart,Election,2729,breitbart,"An ethics watchdog organization asked the House Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate Rep. Charlie Crist (D-FL) for allegedly abusing the proxy vote process.

Under the House Clerk’s coronavirus policies, members of Congress are allowed to vote by proxy if they are unable to vote in person on the House floor due to the “public health emergency.”

However, Crist has cited this House policy as the reason for voting by proxy over 100 times between January to April 7. During this period, Crist only voted in person 18 times over four days in March.

Crist reportedly filed letters to the House Clerk that said he continues “to be unable to physically attend proceedings in the House Chamber due to the ongoing public health emergency.”

The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a nonprofit organization founded by former President Donald Trump’s once Acting Attorney General Matthew Whittaker, argued the real reason Crist used proxy voting 107 times was due to his ongoing gubernatorial campaign in Florida.

However, contrary to Crist’s statement to the House Clerk, it is evident that the true reason he is voting by proxy and virtually attending committee hearings is unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rather, the reason is so he can campaign for governor. On days he has voted by proxy, Crist has attended public events for his gubernatorial campaign

FACT’s call for an investigation came after Crist’s spokesperson admitted the Florida gubernatorial hopeful used the proxy vote process so he could maintain his ongoing campaign.

FACT supplemented its complaint with multiple examples of Crist voting by proxy while he was on the campaign trail in Florida.

FACT executive director Kendra Arnold accused Crist of not fulfilling his obligation to “maintain the integrity of government action.”

In this case, both public and on the record, evidence leave little room for doubt that Rep. Crist is taking advantage of a rule passed for a national health emergency in attempts to further his political career. The ethics rules function to maintain the integrity of government action, and the Office of Congressional Ethics is responsible for ensuring each Member fulfills the public trust inherent in the office and that they comply with the House’s ethical standards.

“Unfortunately, in this case Rep. Crist appears to have fallen far short of this standard, therefore, we urge the Board to immediately investigate Rep. Crist for abusing the proxy vote,” Arnold concluded.

Recent polling data shows that Crist will likely lose Florida’s gubernatorial election if he advances through the Democrat primary and faces Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in November. DeSantis beats Crist by an average of 8.8 percent, according to RealClearPolitics current data.",Election
breitbart,Election,2203,breitbart,"Former President Donald Trump is endorsing people, such as Republican Senate candidate for Ohio J.D. Vance, who can beat Democrats in the general election, Trump senior adviser Lynne Patton told Breitbart News Saturday ahead of Saturday night’s rally in Delaware County.

Trump is holding a rally in Ohio Saturday with J.D. Vance, whom he endorsed this month, noting that Vance champions America First policies. Patton predicted that it is going to be an “electric” event.

“Primaries are critical, but the general is even more important and Trump is endorsing people who can beat the Democrat candidate in Ohio, and nothing is more important,” Patton said. “And as I stated last week, Trump’s endorsement is the most sought-after prize in politics.”

“Trump’s undeniable hold on the Republican Party and MAGA base is tighter than G.I. Joe’s Kung Fu Grip and remains unmatched as evidenced by the fact that Trump has raised more money than the RNC and DNC combined this quarter,” she continued, explaining that 98 percent of the donations have been less than $200, which confirms that Trump’s grassroots support is growing.

Vance, Patton continued, reaped the benefits immediately after Trump’s endorsement, as nearly $5 million in new donations poured in.

“And he’s taken the lead in this race for Senate for the first time since tossing his name in the ring,” she said, explaining that Vance’s positions are aligned with Trump’s — from closing the border to tariffs on China.

“And at the end of the day, that’s what matters and the polls reflect it,” she said.

“Democrats don’t have an agenda that delivers results, and they know it,” she said as she and host Matthew Boyle discussed the left’s latest attempts to drive a wedge between Trump and GOP party leaders, such as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).

Americans are dealing with surging immigration, a supply chain crisis, rising crime, rampant inflation — all of which have “single handedly lifted our party to the highest midterm election vote in the last 40 years,” Patton said, also noting the diversity of the GOP candidates running across the country.

Americans were safer, healthier, and richer under Trump, she continued, noting that Americans are now paying hundreds more per month on living expenses because of President Biden’s leadership.

Trump’s endorsement of Vance in Ohio is of particular interest, as Trump flipped the state by breaking through to working class communities. His tax incentives encouraged factories to stay in the U.S. instead of moving overseas, and more Americans were working under Trump, Patton explained, noting that “when you earn more, you spend more.” Disposable income, she continued, grew by “nearly” ten percent, and consumer confidence reached a record high. Americans were spending more and saving more, from five percent to eight percent, Patton continued, explaining that Ohio, specifically, benefited because Trump rolled back Obama’s “job killing regulations,” including the Waters of the U.S. rule, which she said “literally crippled farmers across this country.”

America had the best economic optimism in decades as Trump continued to put America first, pulling the U.S. out of bad trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Patton described as a “huge deal.” Americans, she said, saw the benefits immediately as Trump continued to negotiate other deals, including pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord. Yet, America became energy independent for the first time in decades, and the U.S. led the world in lowest carbon emissions without being part of the bad deal, she said, explaining that Trump showed that imbalanced deals never put America first.

“It boils down to common sense, Matt. Trump put America first. It’s not that complicated, but evidently, in a world of politics and Democrats, they continually put other countries ahead of us,” she said, ultimately encouraging Ohio Republicans to get out and vote.",Election
breitbart,Election,984,breitbart,"Every candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump in Texas’s Republican primaries have either won or are substantially leading their races as of 11:00 p.m. ET, potentially solidifying Trump’s kingmaker status in the first primaries of 2022.

The 45th president gave his stamp of approval — a much coveted prize among Republican hopefuls — to 33 candidates. Polling out of Texas has already shown that GOP voters are more likely to support candidates who have passed Trump’s muster.

The former president released a statement celebrating his late night victory:

Big night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff. Governor Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick have won in a landslide. Thank you, and congratulations to all!

Trump’s endorsement secured the nomination of incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who faced fierce primary opposition from former State Sen. Don Huffines and former State Party Chairman Allen West. He also lifted two of House Republicans’ top recruits to the nomination without a runoff: Monica De La Cruz and Wesley Hunt, who are both at 56 percent with well over half the votes counted.

The Texas primaries are the first regularly scheduled primary elections in the 2022 cycle, making it the first opportunity to test the power of Trump’s endorsement post-presidency. As Breitbart News previously reported, how Trump fares on these races could influence how aggressive he gets in future primaries elsewhere in America.

“After incredible success with President Trump’s endorsements up and down the ballot last year, all 33 of President Trump’s endorsed candidates came in first tonight – an unprecedented start to the 2022 midterms,” President Trump’s former White House Political Director Brian Jack told Breitbart News.",Election
breitbart,Election,2688,breitbart,"George P. Bush may be floundering in his race for Texas attorney general due to the political toxicity of his family name, according to all available data.

In decades past, there were few political dynasties in Texas as unstoppable as the Bush family name with a solid legacy stretching all the way back to the 1960s. In the age of Trump, the name’s staying power appears to have waned, and George P. Bush may be the latest casualty. Up against incumbent Ken Paxton, Bush cannot seem to find a rhythm with voters who either view him as an untrustworthy RINO or an opportunist spouting Trumpian slogans to win MAGA support. Per the Texas Tribune:

His ubiquitous name recognition is emerging as a liability in the Republican party. George P. Bush, who currently serves as the state’s land commissioner, is trailing Paxton in polls. Some of the top reasons Republican voters are reluctant about him are his ties to his family’s center-right political leanings and his own past policy positions. Bush said those attacks are led by Paxton and don’t reflect the support he has seen on the campaign trail. The sitting attorney general’s ads against Bush focus on labeling him a RINO — Republican in name only — and linking him to his famous family.

In fairness to George P. Bush, he endorsed Trump both times he ran for president and has courted his endorsement during the attorney general race (Trump endorsed Ken Paxton early on). Similar to Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance, he has also completely reversed some of his past centrist policy proposals on issues like immigration and border security, but no matter how authentic the turnaround, Bush may not be able to escape his own name.

“What drives me crazy about people like George P. Bush and the establishment is that they just want to focus on slogans like ‘Keep Texas red’ and they don’t seem to understand that in order to do that, we have to really fight hard,” said Texas voter Christin Bentley.

“Right now, we need people who are not afraid of controversy and be very aggressive in protecting the rights of Texans and not politically correct kind of people,” added Bentley.

Beyond the attorney general race, the Bush name has floundered in other areas as well. His cousin, Pierce Bush, finished third in the 2020 race for a Houston congressional seat and there is virtually no national Bush brand to speak of.

Jason Villalba, chair of the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation, said that the days of Bush’s compassionate conservatism may finally be at an end.

“The compassionate conservatism that George W. Bush embodied when he was governor is no longer that something that people that vote in Republican primaries are looking for,” he said. “That’s not popular today. What’s popular is the far-right, strident wing of Trump in the Republican party. And that’s not him.”",Election
breitbart,Election,1844,breitbart,"Businessman David McCormick has been trending upwards in the poll as celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz appears to be in free fall as the primary election is roughly one month away.

Two separate polls on the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary show McCormick in the lead, surging ahead of the celebrity doctor.

The most recent poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies for the McCormick-aligned super PAC, Honor Pennsylvania, which the Washington Examiner first reported, showed McCormick with 22 percent in the poll. In comparison, Dr. Oz only has 16 percent.

The poll also showed McCormick in the lead since February and Dr. Oz declining 15 percentage points since January, just before McCormick officially entered the race.

While McCormick and Dr. Oz have traded jabs as the frontrunners, Kathy Barnett, Carla Sands, and Jeff Bartos are also in the race, polling around ten percent. The poll was conducted from March 29 to April 3 with 600 likely voter respondents and a four percent margin of error.

The Examiner reported that the poll indicated that Dr. Oz’s image had fallen since January. His favorabilitly reportedly started at 49 percent and is now at 37 percent, and his unfavorability has gone from 24 percent to 49 percent.

Mark Harris, a strategist with the McCormick-aligned super PAC, told the Examiner that Dr. Oz “has a 49% unfavorable image, and only 17% of those polled think he’s a conservative,” said Harris. “That is a very bad place to be in a GOP primary.”

A Fox News poll conducted in a joint effort with the Democrat polling firm Beacon Research and Republican polling firm Shaw & Company Research in early March, showed a similar trend, with McCormick in the lead.

McCormick showed 24 percent in the poll, while the celebrity doctor showed 15 percent. The other candidates — Barnett, Carla, and Bartos — hovered between six and nine percent.

The Fox News poll was conducted from March 2 to 6 with 960 Pennsylvania Republican primary voters and a three percent margin of error.

breitbart,Election,4056,breitbart,"Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) said during a campaign event that Utahns need to reelect Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) to stop Democrat “warmongers” from pushing America closer to nuclear war with Russia.

Gabbard — who recently left the Democrat Party because of its “cowardly wokeness” and “stoking anti-white racism” — appeared at a packed gymnasium with Lee at the American Preparatory Academy in Draper, Utah.

The former Hawaii congresswoman, who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, called Democrats “warmongers” who are “subservient to the military industrial complex” and are continuing to push the country towards nuclear war.

Gabbard said voters have to send politicians such as Lee to the Senate to “push the brakes on this and stop them [Democrats] from destroying life as we know it.”

She continued, saying that America’s “freedom is at stake,” noting that Democrat leaders are attacking and undermining freedom of speech, religion, and other rights. She said that Democrats are “throwing our Constitution in the trash.”

The former Democrat noted that women are under attack with “all this business about Title IX and trans ideology.”

“They’re trying to erase us as women, as an entire category of people, saying that we don’t actually exist,” she added.

McMullin, a former CIA agent, called Gabbard an “apologist” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Tulsi Gabbard is most known for her cozy relationship with Vladimir Putin. Sen. Lee inviting her here to Utah as Putin commits unspeakable atrocities in Ukraine is a terrible mistake,” McMullin said.

Lee asked Gabbard during the campaign event if she loves Putin.

breitbart,Election,1916,breitbart,"President Joe Biden exploited an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) in October 2020, blaming President Donald Trump after sensational arrests in a crucial swing state — yet the trial ended Friday without any convictions.

Two of the accused, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were acquitted. The jury deadlocked on the charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft, the supposed leaders of the plot.

The Biden campaign and the establishment media treated all of the accused as if they were Trump supporters, yet Caserta was seen online in front of an anarchist flag, and Harris had joined a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020 — both facts that were buried by the Democrat and the media in blaming Trump.

At the time the FBI announced the charges in October 2020, with the presidential campaign at a crucial point, Biden suggested that the defendants were white supremacists, and that Trump was at fault for the plot:

There is no place for hate in America. And both of us [including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) have been talking about this for some time, about how white supremacists and these militias area a genuine threat. I want to compliment the FBI and the police agencies for what they did, and how they stepped up. But look –the words of a president matter. Whether they can — you’ve heard me say this before. They can cause a nation to have th market rise or fall, go to war or bring peace, but they can also breathe oxygen into those who are filled with hate and danger, and I just think It’s got to stop. The president has to realize the words he utters matter.

There was no evidence at the time tying Trump to the plot whatsoever, nor did any such evidence emerge during the trial.

As the trial continued, questions were raised about the role of the FBI informants, suggesting that they may have entrapped the defendants, or concocted the plot themselves. As Buzzfeed News — hardly a right-wing outlet — noted last year:

An examination of the case by BuzzFeed News also reveals that some of those informants, acting under the direction of the FBI, played a far larger role than has previously been reported. Working in secret, they did more than just passively observe and report on the actions of the suspects. Instead, they had a hand in nearly every aspect of the alleged plot, starting with its inception. The extent of their involvement raises questions as to whether there would have even been a conspiracy without them.

The judge issued jury instructions on entrapment, telling jurors they could find the defendants not guilty if they believed “[t]hat the agents or informants sought to persuade or pressure the men into agreeing to such a plot; and that the defendants showed no predisposition to commit such a crime until after the FBI came into the picture,” the Associated Press noted.

The FBI had shown a consistent hostility toward Trump both before and during his administration, with key FBI figures involved in pursuing the false “Russia collusion” conspiracy theory, even lying to a court to obtain a surveillance warrant.

breitbart,Election,1051,breitbart,"Gov. Brian Kemp continues to hold a modest lead over former Sen. David Perdue in the heated Republican primary race for governor in Georgia, according to a poll published Thursday.

The poll, conducted February 28 to March 1 by Fox5 Atlanta/InsiderAdvantage, showed Kemp leading Perdue by nine points, 44 percent to 35 percent. Three percent of respondents backed right-wing candidate Kandiss Taylor, who remains in a distant third place, and another 15 percent said they were undecided or had no opinion.

Kemp’s lead is consistent with that of two other recent polls. A Quinnipiac poll conducted in January showed Kemp with a seven-point edge over Perdue, and a Trafalgar survey taken in February had the governor at a ten-point advantage over his opponent.

The primary race is being closely watched across the country largely because former President Donald Trump has drawn attention to it by repeatedly voicing his desire to unseat Kemp because of Trump’s disapproval of Georgia’s 2020 election process.

Trump quickly announced his endorsement of Perdue when Perdue entered the race in December and sought to strengthen Perdue’s position in the race by urging Democrat-turned-Republican Vernon Jones, a former state representative, to drop out of the gubernatorial primary and instead compete in a congressional race. Jones did so on February 7 and received Trump’s coveted endorsement for his congressional bid just two days later.

While Perdue appears to be lagging at this stage of the primary, with a little under three months to go until race day, InsiderAdvantage noted that “the one bit of good news for Perdue is that Kemp, as an incumbent governor, continues to remain under fifty percent in the polls. Usually, that signals a potential upset for the incumbent.”

The poll also weighed the primary field for the Senate race, which is poised to become an expensive battleground general election contest between incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) and the leading Republican candidate, Herschel Walker.

Walker, a former football legend and household name in Georgia, has continued to hold outsize leads over his closest Republican opponent, Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black. While Walker’s lead has seen a reduction from roughly 80 percent to 70 percent to now 63 percent in the InsiderAdvantage poll, Black continues to poll in the single digits, receiving six percent in the latest poll.

Walker, who is currently in a comfortable position to win his primary, recently spoke out about the contentious gubernatorial primary battle, saying he was “mad at both” Kemp and Perdue and concerned that bitter campaign fighting could prove so divisive that it ends up thwarting Republicans’ chances of defeating the Democrat candidate, voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, in the general election.

“We’ve got to bring this party together,” Walker said during a recent appearance at the University of North Georgia.

“What has happened now is some people get sour grapes, and they don’t get out and vote,” Walker continued. “And I want to say whoever loses that race, whether it’s Gov. Kemp or Sen. Perdue, he needs to tell his people to go out and vote for the other. It’s time for you to stop having sour grapes and think about this party.”

breitbart,Election,4478,breitbart,"MIAMI, Florida — Former President Donald Trump told the conservatives currently withholding support from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy in McCarthy’s speakership bid to stand down in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News here on Friday.

“I like him,” Trump said of McCarthy, before teeing off on those working against him such as Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Matt Rosendale (R-MT), Bob Good (R-VA), and Ralph Norman (R-SC). While Trump did not name those trying to stop McCarthy from taking the Speaker’s gavel on January 3, he in no uncertain terms said he disagrees with their efforts—and warned that there could be serious consequences if McCarthy does not get the gavel and they could make Washington worse for conservatives.

Trump’s interview came Friday morning here at his Doral golf resort in Miami and covered a broad range of topics including the Speakership race and much more.

Trump warned that when conservatives took out now-former House Speaker John Boehner in 2015, they ended with now-former Speaker Paul Ryan—who he said was much worse—in the process.

“I think it’s a very dangerous game that’s being played,” Trump said. “It’s a very dangerous game. Some bad things could happen. Look, we had Boehner and he was a strange person but we ended up with Paul Ryan who was ten times worse. Paul Ryan was an incompetent speaker. I think he goes down as the worst speaker in history. We took [out] Boehner—and a group of people, some of whom are the same, and they’re very good friends of mine. All those people are very good friends of mine.”

Trump is hardly the first major conservative leader to raise these concerns. Nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin has raised the concerns, as have people such as Reps. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and James Comer (R-KY)—the incoming chairmen respectively of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees. Congresswoman-elect Harriet Hageman of Wyoming, who just defeated outgoing Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), has also warned of the concerns.

Trump also expanded on the point of just how bad Ryan was for the party, saying Boehner was like a historic world leader in comparison, and now Republicans have to “live with this maniac” Ryan, who he said is hurting Fox News and the New York Post from his position on the board at the Fox Corporation.

“Think of it—we ended up with Paul Ryan. Boehner was like Winston Churchill compared to Paul Ryan,” Trump said. “Boehner wasn’t perfect—nobody’s perfect—but Paul Ryan was a disaster for the Republican Party. That’s what we got. Now we have to live with him. He’s destroying Fox and he’s destroying the New York Post. We got to live with this maniac. This guy, Paul Ryan, couldn’t have gotten elected in his own area of Wisconsin. I went with him after I won the election and we had a tremendous crowd of people and they booed him off the stage. You remember that? They booed him off the stage. This guy is now telling Fox what to do.”

Asked if this all means he backs McCarthy in the race, Trump said, “Yeah, I support McCarthy.”

“Everybody wants my support,” Trump said. “I was 99 percent on endorsements [in the primary]. I don’t know the percentage but I was 233 and 22 on general election. Everybody would say that ‘yeah for the nomination he’s incredible but for the general election…’ But what’s that percentage? 233 and 22—it’s incredible. They always want my endorsement.”

Then Trump further explained why he believes McCarthy deserves the gavel.

“Look, I think this: Kevin has worked very hard,” Trump said. “He is just—it’s been exhausting. If you think, he’s been all over. I think he deserves the shot. Hopefully he’s going to be very strong and going to be very good and he’s going to do what everybody wants.”

Trump also noted, again without naming them specifically, that he is “friendly” with many of the people working against McCarthy—but warned them to knock it off or they could make things worse. Trump even referenced the concerns, as a recent Breitbart News article reported, warning of a “doomsday scenario” where Democrats might partner with an establishment Republican, if McCarthy goes down, to hand that establishment figure the Speakership. In exchange for Democrat votes, the concern is that such a Republican might agree to a House rules change, weakening or altogether scrapping subpoena power.

“Now, I’m friendly with a lot of those people who are against Kevin. I think almost every one of them are very much inclined toward Trump, and me toward them. But I have to tell them, and I have told them, you’re playing a very dangerous game,” Trump said. “You could end up with the worse situation. I don’t even want to say what it is, but I could tell you it’s a worse situation. You could end up with some very bad situations. I use the Boehner to Paul Ryan example. You understand what I’m saying? It could be a doomsday scenario. It could be. You could end up with somebody who would be a disaster like Paul Ryan was.”",Election
breitbart,Immigration,4117,breitbart,"Former President Donald Trump on Thursday cautioned an Iowa crowd against voting for Democrats in next week’s midterm election, arguing that they will “defund the police,” while Republicans will “defund the cartels.”

In one of his final rallies before Election Day, Trump highlighted his administration’s success at securing the Southern border and encouraged Iowans to vote Republican to return to those successful policies.

“We had the best years in 31 years on stopping drugs, stopping human trafficking and all other things,” Trump said. “But they went up 2,500 percent. And it’s now a $13 billion-a-year industry. Can you believe it? It’s like an industry.”

“The choice this election is very simple,” Trump added. “Democrats will defund the police. Republicans will defund the cartels, and we were doing that.”

Trump touted his immigration successes, which include, amongst other things, ending catch-and-release at the border and implementing the Remain in Mexico policy.

Under my leadership, we waged war on the cartels. We ended catch and release, we stopped asylum fraud, and we threw illegal alien gang members out of our country by the tens of thousands. And we got their countries to accept them. They wouldn’t take them under the previous administration. We got them to accept. I said, “How much do we pay those countries?” Three countries, you know, the countries. “Sir, it’s $750 million a year.” I said, tell them we’re not paying them anymore unless they take them back. And they say, “Sir, we’d love to take them back. Nobody’s ever asked us quite that way. Not quite that way.”

Trump also encouraged voters to turn out in massive numbers on Election Day and deliver a “giant red wave” for Republicans in Congress.

“There’s only one choice to end this madness. If you support the decline and fall of America, then vote for the radical left Democrats. It’s very simple,” Trump said. “And if you want to stop destruction, save our country and save the American dream, then this Tuesday, you must vote Republican in a giant red wave, giant red wave.”

breitbart,Immigration,1382,breitbart,"Russian missiles struck an airport near Lviv on Friday – the far-western Ukrainian city where hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Russian invasion have sought shelter, and hundreds of foreign journalists are based. Lviv is less than 50 miles from the Polish border.

Until now, Lviv has been one of the major Ukrainian cities least affected by the Russian attack. It has become a hub for Ukrainian refugees heading for Poland, with a “humanitarian village” sprouting on its outskirts.

Mayor Andriy Sadovy told the Financial Times on Friday that his city is at “the limits of our capacity” for refugees, with “all available infrastructure” stressed to the limit, so he had to raise “the red flag.”

“If we don’t get substantial support in the next week there will be difficult times ahead,” Sadovy warned.

Sadovy described Lviv as the “soul” of Ukraine, pointing to the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the center of the city, with historic buildings dating back to the fifth century.

“During the first and second world wars, Lviv wasn’t bombarded. But you saw what the Taliban did to Afghanistan’s architectural monuments. Will Putin follow that path? I just don’t know,” he said.

The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) warned on Friday that Ukraine’s food supply chain is “falling apart,” as the movement of goods has “slowed down due to insecurity and the reluctance of drivers.” WFP further cautioned that it obtains almost half of its wheat, for humanitarian aid missions around the world, from Ukraine.

Lviv’s International Media Center, established a few days before the Russian invasion, began with help from the Ukrainian national government and has played host to over 800 journalists from 50 different countries.

Reporters Without Borders (widely known by its French acronym RSF) created a Press Freedom Center in Lviv on March 4, “located within the premises” of the existing International Media Center. In addition to providing Internet access and media resources for journalists, the RSF project distributes protective gear and provides “shelter in the event of an attack.”

The first attack came on Friday, as Russian missiles struck on the outskirts of Lviv, as well as in the Ukrainian national capital of Kyiv.

CBS News described clouds of black smoke rising into the clear sky over Lviv on Friday morning, after a Russian strike “hit what was said to be a facility for the repair of military aircraft.”

Mayor Sadovy said at least one person was injured in the attack. The casualty count was low because the plant was not in operation at the time of the missile strike.

The Ukrainian air force said the Russian strike involved six “cruise missiles,” probably launched from Russian heavy strategic bombers over the Black Sea. It said two of the missiles were destroyed in flight. A similar cruise missile attack struck the Yavoriv military base west of Lviv last weekend, killing 35.",Immigration
breitbart,Immigration,2494,breitbart,"An explosive report from James O’Keefe’s watchdog organization Project Veritas accuses President Joe Biden’s administration of resettling Afghans, listed on the federal government’s “Terrorism Watch List,” across American communities over the last eight months as part of its withdrawal from Afghanistan.

With the help of Republicans and Democrats in Congress, Biden has resettled more than 85,000 Afghans in American communities across 46 states since mid-August 2021 and plans to continue resettling tens of thousands of Afghans throughout the year.

Biden is currently asking Congress to authorize the resettlement of Afghans for the next decade and to put resettled Afghans on a fast-track to naturalized American citizenship. That plan is being supported by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Rob Portman (R-OH).

This week, Project Veritas released a report alleging that whistleblowers from inside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have handed over documentation allegedly showing that Biden resettled Afghans in the U.S. who are considered national security threats with ties to terrorism.

Breitbart News was not able to independently verify whether the individuals named in the Project Veritas report were, in fact, the individuals on the Terrorism Watch List.

“The records we’ve obtained confirm these individuals as national security threats currently within our borders,” O’Keefe states.

Anwarallhaq Wahidi, for example, is allegedly listed as a “Category 15” threat on the agency’s Terrorism Watch List for having used explosives or arms in the past, according to Project Veritas, and is considered armed and dangerous.

“Documents further reveal he was only added to the Terrorist Watch List after already being admitted into the U.S. on October 17, 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome,” O’Keefe states. “Wahidi applied the next day for a two-year work visa and 10 days later, it was approved.”

Nazir Ahmad Rahimi is allegedly listed as a “Category 7” threat on the Terrorism Watch List, alleges to Project Veritas. The report claims that Rahimi entered the U.S. on August 24, 2021, and was allegedly flagged by DHS for having “engaged or is likely to engage in an unspecified terrorist act.”

Project Veritas claims that Rahimi was taken into custody by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency on December 1, 2021, but has not been deported. Project Veritas alleges that his last known address is located in Washington, D.C.

Ismail Jurat arrived in the U.S. on August 31, 2021, according to Project Veritas. Less than a month after his U.S. arrival, Project Veritas alleges, DHS re-added Jurat to their Terrorism Watch List as a “Category 15” threat.

Jurat’s work visa, Project Veritas claims, has been approved by DHS.

Tahsinullah Wafa Manozai was given humanitarian parole by the Biden administration on October 14, 2021, upon entry into the U.S., according to Project Veritas, and was allegedly added to the Terrorism Watch List the following day as a “Category 7” threat. His two-year work visa was approved, Project Veritas claims.

Iobal Alokozay was allegedly arrested in Afghanistan for murder in December 2014, according to Project Veritas, and given humanitarian parole after entering the U.S. on August 25, 2021. Abiding by Biden’s so-called “sanctuary country” orders, ICE dismissed Alokozay’s case, Project Veritas alleges, because it “does not meet ICE enforcement priorities.”

Alokozay remains in the U.S., and his work visa application is currently pending, according to Project Veritas.

The Project Veritas accusations come as Breitbart News has extensively chronicled the Biden administration’s failed vetting of Afghan nationals to the U.S.

In February, the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Inspector General issued a report detailing how the Biden administration resettled Afghans in American communities without properly vetting them beforehand.

Many have been deemed “significant security concerns” and cannot be located in the U.S.

Specifically, the Defense Department report details how Biden’s “agencies did not use all available data when vetting Afghan evacuees” and therefore, the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) discovered “Afghans with derogatory information … who were believed to be in the U.S.”

“As of November 2, 2021, NGIC personnel had identified 50 Afghan personnel in the United States with information in DOD records that would indicate potentially significant security concerns … DOD personnel could not locate some Afghan evacuees whom NGIC personnel identified as having derogatory information,” the report concluded.

The report indicates that the unvetted Afghans flagged for security concerns who have gone missing inside the U.S. interior “could pose a security risk to the United States.” Biden’s State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) also run the risk of providing those Afghans with visas, green cards, and naturalized American citizenship.

“The U.S. government could mistakenly grant ineligible Afghan evacuees with derogatory information from the DoD ABIS database SIV or parolee status,” the report states.

breitbart,Immigration,1652,breitbart,"While the mainstream media focuses 24/7 on the war over the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine, the territorial sovereignty of the United States may get even worse. The open-borders Left has been putting intense pressure on the Biden Administration to end the use of “Title 42” removals at the border—a policy that Biden’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is about to review in April.

Title 42 removals are based on the provision of federal law found at 42 U.S.C. § 265 that empowers the president “to prohibit, in whole or in part, the introduction of persons and property” into the United States in order to stop a contagious disease from spreading. President Trump’s CDC issued an order announcing the use of this provision on March 20, 2020, to stop the spread of COVID-19; and the Biden Administration has kept it in place. It allows the Border Patrol to immediately remove aliens encountered at the border.

Since March 2020, the federal government has executed 1.72 million expulsions of illegal aliens under Title 42. The pace of Title 42 removals increased during the Biden Administration. In its first full 13 months in office, the Biden Administration expelled 1,256,748 illegal aliens—or about 97,000 per month. It’s the only effective immigration enforcement tool that the Biden Administration has left in place since taking office.

It has allowed the Border Patrol to at least do something meaningful to respond to the invasion at our southern border.

But that’s only half of the immigration enforcement equation. The other half is interior enforcement to remove illegal aliens who are already in the country, which the Biden Administration has all but destroyed. In January, February, and September of 2021, the Biden Administration issued three policy memoranda that effectively prevent ICE officers from detaining or removing illegal aliens—even though federal law mandates that those aliens must be detained and removed. The consequences of the new Biden non-enforcement policy were devastating.

At the beginning of 2022, many people were wondering why the Biden Administration had not yet issued its FY 2021 ICE Annual Report, which provides total deportation numbers for the fiscal year. We knew that the lax interior enforcement had encouraged a surge of illegal immigration at the border with over 200,000 apprehensions per month at the border during the Summer of 2021. The calendar year 2021 saw approximately 1.9 million apprehensions, more than triple the previous year. But just how bad were the interior enforcement numbers?

Finally, three months late, ICE issued the report on March 11, 2022. And it became clear why the Biden Administration was so reluctant to release it. The numbers were embarrassingly low. In FY 2021, ICE removed only 59,011 noncitizens. That number was down from 185,884 in FY 2020. In other words, in FY 2021 ICE removed only 32% of the number of aliens it removed in FY 2020.

Biden’s immigration policy is like playing defense in a football game without a defensive backfield—no safeties, no defensive backs, and no linebackers either. In such a game, all the offense has to do is get past the defensive line (the Border Patrol); and they score a touchdown every play. Once illegal aliens get a few miles into the United States and past the outmanned Border Patrol, their probability of ever being deported is nearly zero.

And now the Biden Administration is considering removing half of the defensive line too. If Title 42 expulsions are ended, the Border Patrol will become little more than a processing agency for incoming illegal aliens. The losers in this game will be the American people and American sovereignty.

Kris W. Kobach served as the elected Secretary of State of Kansas during 2011-19. He currently serves as general counsel for the Alliance for Free Citizens and is lead counsel for Texas sheriffs and Federal Police Foundation ICE officers who are suing to stop the illegal Biden policies in federal court.

breitbart,Immigration,3475,breitbart,"Former U.S. Army General Don Bolduc, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in New Hampshire, blasted Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) in an interview with Breitbart News and said New Hampshire voters should support him because he is “an outsider who’s not bought and paid for.”

Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle opened the interview by asking Bolduc about his thoughts on Senate Democrats’ latest reconciliation bill, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Bolduc told Boyle, “We’ve seen this movie before, and it never ends well, and it hasn’t ended well.”

“And we have the Biden administration, with the full support of Senator Hassan, almost 100% of the time voting to what? Undermine our energy independence, create inflation, make our borders insecure, cost Granite Staters and Americans millions and billions of dollars,” Bolduc said. “It’s totally irresponsible, they’re weak, feckless, dangerous, and hugely expensive.”

Stopping excessive government spending is a priority to Bolduc, who started the “hell no to spending caucus.”

He criticized Hassan for being a part of the establishment that has made life unbearable for most Americans.

“Maggie Hassan for the last 40 years in politics as a state senator, a governor, and now five and a half miserable years for Granite Staters,” he said. “She does nothing but increase the size of government, increase taxes, and is very irresponsible in her spending, although she claims otherwise.”

Bolduc distinguished himself from his opponent by touting his status as an outsider candidate who is not bought and paid for by big money organizations.

“I am the right candidate because, one, I’m an outsider. I’m not bought and paid for the establishment across the board,” Bolduc said.

Bolduc also highlighted the policies he plans to advocate for if elected to the Senate this fall.

I’m not going down there to work for any individual Senator, I’m not going down there to work for any individual party, although I am a Republican, I’m going down into work for Granite Staters, and the American people and do the right common sense things, to get our economy back to where it needs to be, because we are weak, and it just takes common sense to just reverse the energy policies, reverse the border policies.

“You need a common sense person who’s an outsider, who’s not bought and paid for, I don’t take money from Big Pharma, Big Education, Big Med, Big Tech. And and so I’m going to be an independent Senator down there,” Bolduc said. “And that’s how I’m going to operate, because I’m not going to have them waiting for me in my office before I even get sworn in.”

Bolduc discussed his time in the military, where he served 36 years in the U.S. Army and did ten tours in Afghanistan and Africa.

Bolduc went to military basic training less than two weeks after graduating high school and worked his way from the bottom “all the way up to general, both in Afghanistan and in Africa.”

You know, from private to Sergeant, I served in the fourth ID and in the 82nd airborne division as an enlisted soldier. I cut my teeth there from the bottom up and decided that I would go to college. And it was the Green to Gold program through the Massachusetts National Guard. And, you know, going from enlisted to Lieutenant Green to Gold. Gold Bar got commissioned in 1988. Within two years, I had passed Special Forces selection. And I was off into the Q Course.

Bolduc said the 72 troops he lost in service are his “‘why for service every single day.”

While serving in the Army, Bolduc told those above him “what they needed to hear, not what they wanted to hear.”

He also talked about standing up to former President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff, Denis McDonough, when the administration changed their Afghanistan strategy.

“And I told him, I said, Hey, you change strategy now, and you’ll never get Afghanistan back. And of course, that’s exactly what happened as soon as Biden became president,” Bolduc said.

While talking about foreign policy, Bolduc mentioned that President Joe Biden’s recent killing of terrorist Ayman al-Zawahiri was not comparable to the “big kill” that former President Donald Trump had when he killed Iran’s Qasem Soleimani.

“So this guy has had a huge influence over this, but he’s been relatively ineffective. He’s not the big kill that the Trump administration did, you know, taking on Iran like that,” Bolduc said. “Oh, do you know how many times we’ve wanted to do that? Right, but we couldn’t do it. And then, you know, Trump comes in and says, Hey, we gotta get rid of this guy. And boom, we get rid of them.”

Bolduc said the messaging from corporate media surrounding al-Zawahiri’s killing is “just a bunch of administrative, administration propaganda by the National Security Council coordinator of misinformation, Admiral Kirby.”

breitbart,Immigration,1317,breitbart,"Celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, told reporters he would forego specific security clearances provided to U.S. Senators in order to maintain his dual citizenship with Turkey.

Oz reportedly said he would choose his Turkish citizenship over receiving certain security clearances. “I can love my country and love my mom,” Oz’s said, whose mother suffers from Alzheimer’s disease.

When asked about his dual citizenship with the United States and Turkey, Oz explained that he keeps his Turkish citizenship to care for his mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’s Disease. When queried what he would do if this would disqualify him from security clearances, Oz stated that he would forego them in this situation, noting “I can love my country and love my mom.” His parents were born in Turkey and under Turkish nationality law, children born to a Turkish mother or a Turkish father are Turkish citizens from birth. Oz served in the Turkish military to maintain dual citizenship.

Although federal law does not prevent dual nationals from serving in Congress, pundits have raised concerns over Oz’s willingness to maintain dual citizenship.

“Oz’s dual citizenship – and his reluctance to renounce Turkish citizenship – will keep the FBI and security managers up at night,” said American Enterprise Institute’s Michael Rubin.

Council of Foreign Relations senior fellow Steve Cook had this to say:

Is he really an agent of the government? There’s not really any evidence of that. But if Oz has business connections that rely on being in the good graces of the government, there are legitimate questions about his views on these issues.

Oz spoke about his desire to maintain Turkish citizenship on the same day reports revealed he is in talks to return to television if his Senate candidacy is unsuccessful. “No one wants to admit defeat, but he isn’t a stupid man. He knows his campaign is on life support. Like any good doctor, he is already looking for alternatives to keep his career alive if he doesn’t win,” a source said.

With the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary scheduled for May 17, Oz has a lot of ground to make up if he wants to win the Republican nomination. A recent poll found Oz trailing Republican candidate David McCormick by nine points.",Immigration
breitbart,Immigration,2024,breitbart,"President Joe Biden’s net approval rating among independents is 19 points lower than former President Donald Trump’s at the same point in their respective presidencies.

Trump held a 39/50 percent approval rating among independents or a net difference of -11 during the spring of 2018.

According to an overall devastating Quinnipiac poll for Biden, his approval rating among independents is 26/56 percent, or a net difference of -30.

Therefore, Biden’s net approval rating among independents is 19 points less than Trump’s (-11/-30).

Trump’s approval rating among the general electorate, compared to Biden’s, again at the same point in their respective presidencies, is a net ten points greater.

Trump’s April 2018 approval rating was 41/52 percent or -11 points. Biden’s April approval rating is 33/54 percent or -21 points. Thus, Trump has an overall net positive difference of ten percentage points.

Biden’s terrible approval rating comes as his administration is dealing with many crises. In February, Russia invaded Ukraine after Biden’s sanctions did not prevent the invasion.

Meanwhile, Biden has not reduced 40-year-high inflation, secured the border, reduced fentanyl overdoses, increased energy independence to reduce gas prices from all-time highs, stopped weekly wages from shrinking, increased supply chain channels, or admitted the deadly Afghanistan withdrawal was a deep embarrassment to the nation.

Instead, Biden has blamed the crises on others.

Biden blamed 40-year-high inflation and record-high gas prices on “Putin’s price hike,” though the evidence says otherwise. As a result, weekly wages have not kelp up with the cost of living, which has only been exacerbated by supply chain woes.

Biden has also spent more time defending Ukraine’s border than the U.S. southern border, where fentanyl has become the greatest killer among 18- to 45-year-olds.

None of these crises were growing during Trump’s presidency.

Instead, Biden was securing the southern border to keep fentanyl out. Gas prices were very low after peace was negotiated in the Middle East. Trump involved the U.S. in no new wars, nor did he embarrass the nation by conducting a deadly withdrawal that killed 14 troops.

Moreover, Trump’s strengths brought greater peace to the world, causing gas prices to remain low while he built up American energy independence.",Immigration
breitbart,Immigration,3113,breitbart,"For the fifth time in a year, House Democrats have blocked a plan that would halt President Joe Biden’s seeking to end the CenterS for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Title 42 authority at the United States-Mexico border, which has helped stem waves of illegal immigration for over two years.

In April, CDC officials announced that the Biden administration would end Title 42 authority at the southern border by May 23. The authority allows Border Patrol agents to quickly return illegal aliens to Mexico after crossing the border and was first imposed by former President Trump in March 2020.

Last month, though, Trump-appointed Judge Robert R. Summerhays ordered Biden to keep Title 42 in place while the issue makes its way through the federal courts.

To ensure Title 42 is preserved, Rep. Yvette Herrell (R-NM) filed legislation known as the PAUSE Act which would prevent Biden from ending the authority at the border until all Chinese coronavirus advisories and emergencies are ended by the federal government.

On Wednesday, for the fifth time, 215 House Democrats blocked consideration of Herrell’s PAUSE Act to preserve Title 42. Democrats previously stopped the legislation from being considered in the House in June and July of 2021, as well as twice in April of this year.

“Dangerous drugs are pouring across the border — 80 percent of the fentanyl killing Americans comes into our country at the southern border,” Rep. Mayra Flores (R-TX) said on the House floor, urging Democrats to stop blocking the legislation.

Flores was sworn into Congress on Tuesday after her historic win in south Texas where she flipped the longtime Democrat-held 34th congressional district. Flores is the first Mexico-born female lawmaker to enter Congress.

Most recently, a number of Republicans have suggested that the use of Title 42 at the border be transferred to combat the nation’s deadly fentanyl crisis rather than the coronavirus.

“More than 100,000 Americans died last year from drug overdoses — mostly from fentanyl — which are really more akin to Chinese Communist Party-engineered poisonings … we desperately need Title 42 to fight this drug epidemic,” Hagerty said.

Without Title 42, Biden officials admit that up to half a million border crossers and illegal aliens — the equivalent of the resident population of Atlanta, Georgia — could arrive at the border every month.

Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) told Breitbart News that he would expect 30,000 border crossers and illegal aliens every day at the border without Title 42. In Tijuana, Mexico, alone, Breitbart News exclusively reported that up to 6,000 foreign nationals are waiting to rush the border when Title 42 is ended.

The Biden administration’s plan for ending Title 42, which Breitbart News reported and published, details “broadscale release mechanisms” that transform the border into a mere checkpoint for foreign nationals arriving every day.

breitbart,Immigration,3690,breitbart,"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) is promising “emergency housing” for migrants bused from Texas even as rents in Chicago have skyrocketed for residents.

Last week, Texas governor Greg Abbott (R) started busing border crossers to the sanctuary city of Chicago after sending thousands over the last few months to the sanctuary cities of Washington, DC and New York City.

In response, Pritzker is promising migrants “emergency housing” as well as “health care screenings, the offer of COVID-19 vaccines and … additional legal resettlement assistance.”

Meanwhile, as Breitbart News has reported, Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot has called Abbott’s sending of the migrant buses “racist and xenophobic” along with “immoral” and “unpatriotic.”

Pritzker’s pledge of emergency housing for migrants comes as Chicagoans face sky-high rents and housing costs. The most recent analysis shows that Chicagoans are paying about 20 percent more on rent this year compared to last year.

Today, the average rent in Chicago is more than $2,900, which is nearly 20 percent higher than the cost of rent at the same time last year. Rents in Chicago have increased so much that tenants are forming unions to fight their landlords and the city.

Real estate investors are some of the biggest beneficiaries of mass immigration to the United States. Immigration-driven population growth, set to bring the United States population to more than 400 million by 2060, is likely to send housing prices even higher.

A 2017 study published in the Journal of Housing Economics found that “increases in immigration into a metropolitan statistical area are linked with rising rents and home prices in that metropolitan statistical area and neighboring metropolitan statistical areas.”

As legal immigration brings over a million legal immigrants to the United States annually, as well as more than a million more on temporary work visas, President Joe Biden’s administration has also implemented an expansive Catch and Release network where every month thousands of border crossers and illegal aliens are sent all over the nation to await court hearings.

In the meantime, those new arrivals need housing.

While it is unclear exactly where border crossers and illegal aliens are resettling, the administration’s Alternative to Detention (ATD) program gives insight into the level of mass immigration into each city coinciding with record-high housing costs.

In August, the Biden administration had more than 13,000 border crossers and illegal aliens in Chicago on the ATD program. In November 2020 fewer than 6,600 border crossers and illegal aliens had been sent to Chicago on the ATD program.

breitbart,Immigration,1350,breitbart,"High gas prices in the United States and now the banning of Russian oil imports following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine are causing Americans to favor domestic energy production, including a poll that shows 71 percent “favor very much” or “favor somewhat” restarting the Keystone XL Pipeline.

The Canadian website The Province reported on the poll:

The idea that Canadian oil and gas could help fill shortfalls in Europe and the United States has received considerable traction in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, with some re-evaluating energy projects such as Keystone XL and Energy East. While 64 per cent of American believe Canada should fill the void left following the ban on Russian oil, the challenge for Canada would be in increasing production — it could take years, not weeks or months — and figuring out how to ship it across the border. Between 2014 and 2017, according to polling from the Pew Research Center, support for the Keystone XL pipeline dropped 17 percentage points, from 59 percent to 42 percent. It also had a major partisan divide in 2017, with 76 percent of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents supporting it, and 74 percent of Democrats opposing it. That year, then-president Donald Trump reversed former president Barack Obama’s decision to halt the pipeline. In January 2021, Biden revoked the cross-border permits the pipeline needed, and the project was officially dead by June 2021.

breitbart,Immigration,1591,breitbart,"President Joe Biden on Saturday compared the plight of Ukrainian refugees fleeing war in their country to the migrants crossing the southern border of the United States.

The president commented on migrants and refugees during an expanded bilateral meeting with Polish president Andrzej Duda at the presidential palace in Warsaw.

Biden praised Poland for accepting millions of Ukrainian refugees after Russia started bombing their country.

“We understand that because we have, in our southern border, thousands of people a day — literally, not figuratively — trying to get into the United States,” Biden commented, signaling solidarity with Poland.

He promised the United States would accept Ukrainian war refugees as well.

“[W]e believe that we, the United States, should do our part relative to Ukraine as well, by opening our borders to another hundred thousand people,” he said.

Biden announced Thursday he would open the United States to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, allowing them to live in the United States legally and possibly receive work permits.

He repeatedly vowed to defend Poland’s border including “every inch” of NATO territory.

“We take as a sacred obligation Article 5 — a sacred obligation, Article 5. And you can count on that,” he said, and added, “For your freedom is ours.”

The president spoke prior to meeting Ukrainian refugees in front of the media, where he engaged with children who had fled their home country.

“You see all those little children? Just wanted to — just want a hug. They just want to say thanks,” he commented to the press after the meeting. “I mean, they’re — I mean, it’s — it just makes you so damn proud. And they’re wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.”",Immigration
breitbart,Immigration,2481,breitbart,"Celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz is under fire from national security experts after a resurfaced photo showed him casting a ballot in Turkey’s 2018 presidential election.

Oz, a dual U.S-Turkish citizen, pledged to revoke his Turkish citizenship if elected to the U.S. Senate after initially saying he’d forego security clearances to maintain it.

Even though Oz claimed on the campaign trail to have “never been politically involved in Turkey in any capacity,” he voted in Turkey’s most recent presidential election, according to his spokesperson, Brittany Yanick, who confirmed the photo’s authenticity.

Yanick defended Oz’s vote by distinguishing casting a ballot from being “actively engaged” in the Turkish government. “Voting in an election is far different from being actively engaged in the political work of the Turkish government, which Dr. Oz has never been involved with,” Yanick told ABC News. “There is no security issue whatsoever.”

Yanick added that Oz’s vote was a last minute decision while visiting Turkey’s consulate to discuss “humanitarian work on behalf of Syrian refugees in Turkey.” Oz reportedly voted for Muharrem Ince in his failed attempt to unseat Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

A former government attorney familiar with federal security clearances said that Oz’s 2018 vote “is problematic from a security clearance perspective.”

With Oz’s dual citizenship at the center of his candidacy for Senate, some national security experts are worried his Turkish ties would set off a “giant, flashing red light” for the civilian background check process.

Elected officials are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny as civilians who seek security clearances for sensitive government work; once sworn-in, lawmakers are granted access to classified information, unless the executive branch denies them certain information. But the background check process for civilians can also “provide a framework for analyzing whether someone is trustworthy or not,” according to Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, a nonprofit public interest law firm. And for McClanahan, voting in another country’s election would set off a “giant, flashing red light.”

Oz reportedly maintains his Turkish citizenship to care for his mother in the country while she battles Alzheimer’s disease. However, Oz had to serve in the Turkish military to receive Turkish citizenship, which he did briefly during the early 1980s.

In addition to his vote in Turkey’s election, national security experts worry about his significant financial ties to the foreign country. Oz has hundreds of thousands of dollars in real estate holdings in Turkey, according to his financial disclosures. Oz even leases out one of his buildings for free to the Turkish Ministry of Education.

Apart from his real estate interests in the country, Oz also has an endorsement deal with Turkish Airlines, the country’s national airline. Oz appeared in a 2018 Super Bowl commercial for the airlines and most recently starred in a four-minute informercial detailing the airlines’ coronavirus safety protocols last year.

“Any single one of those would be enough to torpedo a [security] clearance,” McClanahan told ABC News. “Taken together, I would not put good odds on that person getting a clearance anywhere.”

Another foreign policy expert said that Oz, who promised to “be the harshest critic of Erdogan” in the Senate, would have no choice but to be friendly with Ergodan to maintain the Turkish Airlines brand ambassador position over the years.

“If you wanted to have a lucrative career as a spokesman for Turkish Airlines, you certainly couldn’t say anything negative about Erdogan,” said Nicholas Danforth, a non-resident fellow at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy.

Oz’s financial disclosures also drew criticism for his ties to China after he reportedly made millions of dollars doing deals with a company that produced its products in China.

Along with national security experts, members of the Armenian-American and Greek-American communities have expressed concerns about Oz’s Turkish ties. They fear that his ties to the country could potentially mainstream Armenian Genocide denial.

However, former President Donald Trump’s former Director of National Intelligence, Ric Grenell, said Oz’s understanding of Turkey is an asset when dealing with totalitarian leaders like Ergodan.

“It is frankly un-American to suggest that first- and second-generation Americans are unworthy or suspect to work as a U.S. official,” Grenell said. “They’ve seen fascism and totalitarianism and are actually more clear-eyed about what is at stake.”

Oz received the Trump endorsement last month ahead of Pennsylvania’s Republican Senate primary, which will occur on May 17.

Other experts lauded Oz for his transparency about his dual citizenship, noting that it would be more of a political risk than a national security risk.

“The fact that [Oz] has made no effort to conceal his dual citizenship counts in his favor,” said Federation of American Scientists senior analyst Steve Aftergood. “Voters will have an opportunity to decide whether or not it is of concern to them.”",Immigration
breitbart,Police,1899,breitbart,"Photos, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, show the extent of damage that was left behind from a fatal drunk-driving crash where an illegal alien was charged with killing a 72-year-old man in Walton County, Florida.

As Breitbart News exclusively reported, 42-year-old illegal alien Jose Virgilio Carcamo Elvir was charged with four felonies, including DUI manslaughter, after allegedly causing an eight-vehicle crash that killed 72-year-old Perry Adrian Cole and injuring three others.

Florida Highway Patrol, as well as eyewitnesses, said Elvir was drunk at the time of the crash and had multiple opened Budweiser cans in his vehicle. Elvir had been driving with an expired license from Alabama though it is unclear how he was able to secure a license being an illegal alien.

Sources close to Breitbart News are now revealing photos from the fatal crash:

The Walton County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that Elvir is an illegal alien living in the United States and that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has placed a detainer on him so that, if he is released, they will take over custody.

According to a report issued by Florida Highway Patrol, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, Elvir was driving drunk in Walton County on April 3 when he crashed into the back of another vehicle and caused an eight-vehicle crash as a result.

Cole, a resident of Palmetto Bay, Florida, was involved in the crash and rushed to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Santa Rosa, Florida, where he was later pronounced dead as a result of his injuries. Three other Americans sustained serious bodily injuries in the crash and were taken to a nearby hospital.

“Just weeks after a Haitian criminal alien brutally murdered a Florida husband and wife in Daytona Beach, another innocent Floridian lost his life at the hands of an illegal alien in Walton County,” Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R) office wrote in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News. “How much senseless violence and suffering will Americans endure, while the Biden Administration doubles down on their reckless open-borders agenda?”

breitbart,Police,4173,breitbart,"A Democrat circular firing squad has targeted far-left Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) for the party’s losses in the U.S. House of Representatives that will likely give Republicans the majority.

The fight erupted on Thursday when Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY) reflected on his failed reelection campaign, lamenting to the New York Times how AOC did not contribute to the Democrats’ overall agenda this election cycle.

“The last time I ran into A.O.C., we were beating her endorsed candidate two to one in a primary, and I didn’t see her one minute of these midterms helping our House majority,” he told the Times.

“But let’s be clear, she had almost nothing to do with what turned out to be an historic defense of our majority,” he added. “Didn’t pay a dollar of dues. Didn’t do anything for our frontline candidates except give them money when they didn’t want it from her.”

Republicans performed well in the state of New York, where they flipped several seats in the suburbs largely thanks to Rep. Lee Zeldin’s impressive campaign against Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul that mobilized turnout due to fears about rampant crime. Though Zeldin did not win the race, political candidates have credited his strong showing against Hochul for the wins that down-ballot Republicans enjoyed in the Empire State.

Maloney stressed that a majority of voters simply do not identify with AOC’s extreme politics.

“There are other voices who should be heard, especially when suburban voters have clearly rejected the ideas that she’s most associated with, from defunding the police on down,” Maloney said. “She’s an important voice in our politics. But when it comes to passing our agenda through the Congress, or standing our ground on the political battlefield, she was nowhere to be found.”

Maloney also feels that Kathy Hochul addressed the crime problem in New York too late in her campaign, yielding to losses in the suburbs.

“New York is home to the fiercest outlet in the News Corporation fear machine,” said Maloney. “In fairness to the governor, she and the rest of us have to contend with the hysteria of The New York Post and of Fox News combined.

breitbart,Police,1672,breitbart,"Senate Democrats discharged Biden Federal Reserve nominee Dr. Lisa Cook, who has a history of canceling those critical of Black Lives Matter (BLM), supporting reparations, and advocating for policies that could politicize the Fed.

The Senate voted on Tuesday to discharge Cook from the deadlocked Senate Banking Committee when the committee voted 12-12 after Banking Republicans unanimously opposed her nomination. Republicans all voted against the motion to discharge her nomination, except for Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), who did not vote. Kennedy had voted against her nomination in committee.

The Senate voted 50-49 to discharge her from the committee, which will make her eligible for a full Senate confirmation vote, although she will face a tough voting schedule, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) plans to spend next week confirming Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) said in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News that Cook would politicize the Federal Reserve.

Cook, if confirmed, would be the first black woman Fed governor, and Democrats have claimed that she would bring a different perspective to the nation’s central bank.

“She’s a Ph.D. economist, she is a tenured professor, and she is sought by organizations around the world for her input and perspective. She will bring a critical voice to the Fed — one that has been missing for far too long,” Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-OH) said.

Republicans have questioned her experience and sounded the alarm about her political activism.

Sen. Pat Toomey (R-PA), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote:

Professor Cook’s history of extreme left-wing political advocacy and hostility to opposing viewpoints also makes her unfit to serve on the Fed. As I’ve said numerous times, it is exceptionally important to keep politics out of the money supply. But unfortunately, we’ve seen the encroachment of politics at the historically independent Federal Reserve. There are people on the left, including in the Biden administration, advocating that the Fed use its supervisory powers to resolve complex political issues, like what to do about global warming, social justice, and even education policy. These are important issues. But they’re wholly unrelated to the Fed’s limited statutory mandates and expertise. Professor Cook’s record indicates that she is likely to inject further political bias into the Fed’s work—at a time when hyper-focus on inflation and adherence to the Fed’s dual mandate is at its most critical. In over 30,000 public tweets and retweets, Professor Cook has supported race-based reparations, promoted conspiracies about Georgia voter laws, and sought to cancel those who disagree with her views, such as publicly calling for the firing of an economist who dared to tweet that he opposed defunding the Chicago police. After Banking Committee Republican staff highlighted these tweets for the public’s attention, Professor Cook blocked the Banking Committee Republican Twitter account—one day before her nomination hearing. Apparently Prof. Cook not only realizes how inflammatory her own tweets are, but also has no regard for the Senate’s constitutional responsibility to vet her public statements.

Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University, gave a presentation in support of H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study and develop reparations proposals.

She has also appeared to agree with calls to have the Federal Reserve focus on targeting its federal funds rate to improve the black unemployment rate, rather than the national employment rate.

The Federal Reserve nominee has also said that alleged disparities in coronavirus aid are due to “systemic racism.”

She has also indicated support for reparations, instituting affirmative action at California universities, corporate board diversity quotas, and job guarantees.

She seemed to suggest that this may not be enough, which is why we need “blue sky thinking” to address the “systemic issues … “structural racism and racial disparities.”

University of Chicago economics professor Harald Uhlig in June 2020 criticized the Black Lives Matter movement for its “full fledged-support” of defunding the police.

Cook soon took to Twitter to accuse Uhlig of “racial harassment” and called on Uhlig to be fired as the editor of the Journal of Political Economy and removed from working with students.

She claimed that “free speech has its limits.”",Police
breitbart,Police,3935,breitbart,"Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko claimed in an interview on Tuesday that Russian missiles have damaged at least 30 percent of the energy infrastructure of the entire nation since Vladimir Putin announced a “massive” strike on Monday.

Halushchenko made the remarks in an interview with CNN.

Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, colonizing its Crimean peninsula with little response from then-American President Barack Obama or the greater West. The invasion, which continued in the form of hostilities in the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine for eight years, escalated into a full-scale attack on the country in February. Last week, an explosive detonated on the Kerch Strait Bridge, a bridge that Putin’s regime built to connect Crimea to Russia, prompting Putin to announce a new initiative specifically targeting Ukraine’s ability to generate electricity.

Russian news outlets have reported, similar to Halushchenko’s assessment, widespread blackouts throughout Ukraine and an ongoing missile assault bombing energy facilities.

Halushchenko said on Tuesday that he believed that the Ukrainian power grid was “still stable” on a large scale, but he could not guarantee how long that would continue to be true and urged the international community to help Ukraine “protect the sky.”

“Russians they are not playing on some games on international laws. They don’t care about any kind of international agreements or conventions,” the energy minister said, noting that bombing energy infrastructure was unprecedented for the Russians in the course of this war.

The Ukrainian outlet Ukrainska Pravda accused Russia of bombing energy facilities to diminish Kyiv’s profits from selling electricity to other countries – a claim that Russia’s Tass news agency echoed. According to Tass, the Russian government and Russian media had identified “massive electricity outages” across the country, noting that, in addition to hurting civilians in Ukraine, the attacks may limit access to electricity for neighboring countries.

“For Ukraine, electricity exports are primarily a source of budget revenues. Kiev [sic] exports power to four countries, namely Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova, Macroeconomic Analysis Chief at Finam Olga Belenkaya explained,” Tass relayed, citing other Russian media. “According to her, the export amounts are hardly critical for Europe but given the current energy crisis, any relatively cheap electricity supplies are vital. As for Ukraine, additional energy-generating capacity will matter a bit later, when the cold weather sets in and consumption rises.”

Russia’s Defense Ministry announced during its regular briefing on Tuesday that the bombings throughout the day had “achieved their goals.”

“Moscow targeted Ukrainian power plants and other critical facilities after what Russian President Vladimir Putin called a series of ‘terrorist attacks’ orchestrated by Ukrainian special services on Russian soil,” Russian propaganda outlet RT relayed, confirming that Russia’s military objective in its latest escalation was to deprive Ukraine of electricity.

The bombings struck far outside Donbas, where the war has raged for nearly a decade, reaching far-west Lviv, about 40 miles from Poland. Lviv, which has taken in thousands of Ukrainians from other parts of the country in the past year, is also suffering rolling blackouts, according to its mayor in posts on the Russian application Telegram on Monday.

RT also accused the Ukrainians of targeting electrical infrastructure within Russia. Citing “local authorities,” RT claimed on Tuesday that Ukrainian forces had begun targeting facilities in the Russian region of Belgorod in response to the missile strikes, successfully bombing an electrical substation.

“The attack on the facility, located in the village of Shebekino, sparked a fire at a transformer and disrupted power supply for some 2,000 people in the area,” RT claimed.

The bombing of the Kerch Strait Bridge, which awoke in flames on Saturday morning, appears to have been a turning point for Putin. The bridge opened in 2018, giving Russia direct access to Crimea without having to travel through other parts of Ukraine and appearing to cement Putin’s stranglehold over the occupied region. The bridge also served to block large ships from crossing out of the Sea of Azov into the Black Sea, effectively blockading the key Ukrainian port cities of Mariupol and Berdyansk.

Russian officials claimed that a truck bomb was detonated on the bridge on Saturday, killing three passersby. Moscow insisted shortly thereafter, however, that the bridge did not sustain major structural damage and published footage of traffic crossing it hours after the bombing.

On Monday, Putin convened a meeting of Russia’s Security Council to discuss the bombing in which he announced that he would dramatically reconfigure military goals in Ukraine to destroying the country’s energy infrastructure.

“This morning, at the proposal of the Defence Ministry and in accordance with the plan of Russia’s General Staff, a massive strike was launched with long-range precision air, sea and land-based weapons against Ukrainian energy, military and communications facilities,” Putin said, according to the Kremlin. “In the event of more attempts to stage terrorist attacks on our territory, Russia’s response will be harsh and commensurate with the threats posed to the Russian Federation. Nobody should have any doubts about that.”

Putin called the bombing an “act of terrorism” and accused the Ukrainian government of executing it. The administration of President Volodymyr Zelensky has not taken responsibility for the bombing, but has celebrated it openly.",Police
breitbart,Police,2399,breitbart,"Antifa rioters attacked a Republican political rally in Portland, Oregon, Saturday and threw smoke canisters and other objects. Attendees said police took more than 20 minutes to respond to calls for help. In a separate incident on Friday, Antifa members threw paint-filled bags, fireworks, and rocks at “People’s Convoy” vehicles.

Supporters of Sandy, Oregon, Mayor Stan Pulliam gathered in a Portland park on Saturday to support his campaign for governor. A short time later, Antifa members arrived and began throwing smoke canisters, paint-filled balloons, and fireworks, Fox News reported. Understaffed Portland police officers reportedly took more than 20 minutes to respond. By the time they arrived, the Antifa members had dispersed.

After police finally arrived, Pulliam told reporters that his supporters experienced what “neighbors throughout the Portland community have to experience on almost a daily basis.”

“We called the police, we called 911,” the gubernatorial candidate running on a platform to “re-fund police” continued. “In fact, at the Justice of Peace Center, we were just outside of their headquarters, sat on hold for over 20 minutes. No police officers ever arrive until the very end, just to take our statement.”

At least two people reportedly sustained injuries during the Antifa attack.

“This is what happens when a Republican dares to hold an event in Portland to talk about funding our police,” Pulliam added. “Antifa shows up. Well, we won’t be intimidated and stop speaking the truth.”

Portland police officials reported they only had “a few officers available in the precinct. They said a sergeant initially responded to monitor the situation and gather resources.

breitbart,Police,1515,breitbart,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that “there were no identifiable victims” in a case where she reduced the prison sentence of a self-proclaimed drug “kingpin.”

During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jackson was asked about the case of convicted drug trafficker Keith Young whom, in 2018, she sentenced to 20 years in prison, but later reduced the sentence.

Young trafficked heroin laced with fentanyl, the deadly drug just one kilogram of which can kill half a million people. There are a million milligrams in one kilogram.

When asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) if she had contacted the victims before reducing Young’s sentence, Jackson suggested that “there were no identifiable victims.”

The exchange went as follows:

COTTON: Judge Jackson, before you granted this fentanyl kingpin’s motion to reduce his sentence, did you contact any of the victims in his case? JACKSON: Senator, thank you for allowing me to address Mr. Young’s situation. COTTON: I asked a simple question, did you contact the victims in his case or not? JACKSON: Senator, Mr. Young was not released. His sentence was reduced and I did not contact the victims in this case because there were no victims. He committed a crime, a drug crime. There were no identifiable victims in his case. COTTON: Drug crimes are not victimless crimes — 100,000 Americans are killed by overdoses. JACKSON: Understood Senator, but there was no one to contact because there were no identifiable…

As Cotton noted, Jackson initially apologized to Young for having to sentence him to 20 years in prison. Following passage of the First Step Act and amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Young requested compassionate release from federal prison.

Though Jackson denied the request, she rewarded him with a reduced sentence that cut his time in prison by at least seven years. Young bragged about his role as a drug “kingpin” and was authorizing payments for drugs while in prison before Jackson cut his sentence.

“You reduced his sentence. He didn’t file a motion to reduce his sentence. He wasn’t eligible for a reduced sentence under the First Step Act because it wasn’t retroactive toward him,” Cotton said.

“You took a motion for compassionate release, to get out of prison, and turned it into a motion to reduce a sentence so he is going to be released seven and a half years earlier, years from now,” he continued.

Across the United States, drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in recent years. From April 2020 to April 2021, for example, more than 100,000 Americans died from overdoses. Deaths from overdoses now outpace the number of Americans killed from car crashes and guns, combined.

breitbart,Police,171,breitbart,"Texas teacher Sarah Beam has been charged with locking her son in the trunk of her car to protect herself from catching the coronavirus.

“The woman faces a charge of child endangerment after she arrived at a Covid-19 testing site with the 13-year-old boy in the back of the vehicle, according to an arrest warrant filed Wednesday,” reports far-left NBC News.

This alleged lunatic is a high school English teacher. According to authorities, she drove into a drive-thru COVID testing station in Houston on Monday and told the people her son was locked in the trunk in order to protect herself from getting infected. Earlier, he had tested positive with the China Flu. So she was bringing him back for additional testing.

According to the warrant, the staffer asked to see the boy, and sure enough, Mom Of The Year opened the trunk, and the poor kid was lying inside.

The staffer reportedly told her to put the kid in the backseat and then called 911. As a result, the mother has been placed on “administrative leave” at her school and an arrest warrant for child endangerment has been issued. She is not yet in custody.

With all the caveats about innocent until proven guilty and all that, here’s another look at one of the hysterical morons who have control of your children all day, every day, for ten months a year in our rotted and corrupt public school system.

Do you have any idea how dangerous it is to put someone in the trunk of a car? One exhaust leak and that poor kid is dead in ten minutes. Someone rear-ends you going just 25 miles per hour… Need I go on? Not to mention the psychological cruelty of having your own mother treat you worse than any decent person would treat an animal.

I’ll bet you dollars to dimes this woman is triple-vaccinated. On top of that, she’s also only 42 years old. This means she has almost nothing to worry about from the China Flu. And yet, it seems pretty safe to guess that a toxic combination of teachers union propaganda and corporate media propaganda have twisted her into a full-blown hysteric, one willing to abuse her own child.

Assuming the reports are accurate (apparently, there’s video footage of the kid exiting the trunk), was she really that scared of catching the China Flu, or was she just worried about her social standing within her peer group? Among the left, if you catch COVID, you must have done something wrong… You must have somehow violated the tenets of the Faith of Fauci.

Teachers are the worst. The very worst.

If she locked this kid in a trunk, you have to wonder what hellscape his life was like at home.

breitbart,Police,614,breitbart,"A recent investigation by the left-wing ProPublica laments that speed cameras are disproportionately ticketing black drivers in cities such as Chicago, even though the technology allows for race-neutral enforcement.

The investigation concluded that drivers from mostly-black neighborhoods are receiving more than twice as many citations from the automated technology than drivers from mostly-white neighborhoods. Authors Emily Hopkins and Melissa Sanchez frame this data point with an activist’s claim that a “punitive approach” to traffic safety laws still upholds “structural racism”:

For all of their safety benefits, the hundreds of cameras that dot the city — and generate tens of millions of dollars a year for City Hall — have come at a steep cost for motorists from the city’s black and Latino neighborhoods. A ProPublica analysis of millions of citations found that households in majority Black and Hispanic ZIP codes received tickets at around twice the rate of those in white areas between 2015 and 2019. The consequences have been especially punishing in black neighborhoods, which have been hit with more than half a billion dollars in penalties over the last 15 years, contributing to thousands of vehicle impoundments, driver’s license suspensions and bankruptcies, according to ProPublica’s analysis. The coronavirus pandemic widened the ticketing disparities. Black and Latino workers have been far less likely than others to have jobs that allow them to work remotely, forcing them into their vehicles more often. In 2020, ProPublica found, the ticketing rate for households in majority-Black ZIP codes jumped to more than three times that of households in majority-white areas. For households in majority-Hispanic ZIP codes, there was an increase, but it was much smaller.

ProPublica noted that it did not count warnings for first-time violators “because they carry no financial penalties.”

The story also includes the extreme example of Rodney Perry, an entrepreneur who received three tickets for running red lights and eight for speeding in a single year, at one point receiving an immobilizing boot on his wheels. Cameras issued many of those citations because Mayor Lori Lightfoot “lowered the threshold for tickets” down to six or seven mph over the speed limit.

“Perry said he takes responsibility for getting tickets,” the ProPublica report said. “But he can’t help but notice something every time he drives through majority-Black neighborhoods: There are fewer pedestrians and more vacant lots and industrial areas.

“It’s almost like you feel like there is nothing there. Nothing to slow you down,” Perry said.

And ProPublica found experts who agree roads, not people, are to blame. Jesus Barajas, an assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at the University of California Davis claimed, “wide roads without what are often called calming measures … encourage speeding.”

A 2020 article in the Insurance Journal highlighted the history of ticketing American drivers using cameras, including the idea that “PhotoCops” would only penalize people based on violating traffic laws and not because of the color of their skin.

The report noted that speed cameras were first installed in Galveston County, Texas, in 1986 but despite spreading around the country since then, there are “only 153 jurisdictions in 17 states that use speed cameras, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, with almost a third of those in one state, Maryland.

The report quoted what a reporter wrote in Vice magazine. “Any effort to eliminate racism in American policing must figure out what to do about traffic enforcement, which is the leading cause of interactions between police and the public, according to the Department of Justice,” the article said. “And, by law, it is almost entirely up to the officer whether to let the person go with a warning, give them a ticket, ask to search their vehicle, or escalate the situation even further. It is an interaction intentionally designed to let the officer do virtually whatever he or she wants, reflecting the inherent biases of our legal system.”

There’s lots of evidence that law enforcement traffic stops disproportionately target Black motorists, and not a whole lot of counter-evidence (although there is some). Even after controlling for multiple possible confounding factors, the bias seems to persist. Perhaps most tellingly, it is less apparent at night, when it’s harder to see what drivers look like. In 2016, South Carolina U.S. Senator Tim Scott, a conservative Black Republican not exactly known as a critic of law enforcement, described how earlier in his political career he had been pulled over seven times in a single year, usually for “nothing more than driving a new car in the wrong neighborhood or some other reason just as trivial.” More-widespread use of speed and red-light cameras wouldn’t eliminate this practice, as there would still be lots of other reasons to pull over drivers. But it would surely reduce its incidence. It would also result in more consistent, fair and comprehensive enforcement of traffic laws.

ProPublica reported that Chicago issues approximately one million camera tickets — about evenly split between the two types of infractions — and that cameras have generated more than $1.3 billion in revenue since the first one was installed nearly two decades ago.

All this under Democrat Mayors Richard M. Daley, Rahm Emanuel, and current Mayor Lori Lightfoot.",Police
breitbart,Police,696,breitbart,"Several Canadian provincial executives resisted Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s invocation of emergency powers on Monday to shut down the Freedom Convoy protests against vaccine mandates.

“I am concerned that there’s a certain kind of person who will hear if the federal government proceeds with this, who will be further enflamed, and that could lead to a prolongation of some of these protests,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said on Monday.

“The view I have, which I conveyed to the prime minister during the forum of first ministers this morning, is that this is not necessary, at least for an Alberta context,” Kenney told reporters.

Kenney stressed that he believes provincial officials already have the powers needed to handle protesters who break the law. He mused several times during press conferences on Monday that unnecessary federal overreach could compromise the authority of provincial governments and further inflame public tensions.

“I think at this point, for the federal government to reach in over top of us, without offering anything in particular, would frankly be unhelpful. I think we need to find ways to effectively enforce without escalating the situation,” he said.

Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe also said his administration “does not support the Trudeau government invoking the Emergencies Act.”

“The illegal blockades must end, but police already have sufficient tools to enforce the law and clear the blockades, as they did over the weekend in Windsor,” Moe said, making an argument similar to Kenney’s.

“If the federal government does proceed with this measure, I would hope it would only be invoked in provinces that request it, as the legislation allows,” Moe added.

Manitoba Premier Heather Stefanson described Trudeau’s move as “unnecessary” and provocative. She refused to “escalate” the situation by following Trudeau’s lead.

“The use of the Emergencies Act is very, very serious, and needs to be considered very seriously before enacting something like that,” Stefanson said after a minister’s meeting with Trudeau on Monday.

“I think it’s important that Manitobans and Canadians know and understand that it’s not necessary, and we need to think very carefully and clearly before going in that direction,” she said.

Stefanson praised law enforcement agencies for “doing very good work” during the protests, and said, they should be left to “do their jobs.”

“At some point, these protests will end one way or another. We just encourage those protesters, we’ve heard you loud and clear,” she said.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault said he was “very clear” during his conversation with Trudeau that “the Federal Emergencies Act should not, must not, apply in Quebec.”

“We don’t have any problems in Quebec so far. The Sureté du Québec has everything under control,” Legault said, referring to his provincial police force.

“I think that at this moment, it would not help the social climate. There’s a lot of pressure right now, and I think we have to be careful. We really don’t need to throw oil on the fire,” he said, drawing parallels with the controversial invocation of emergency powers in Quebec in 1970 by the current prime minister’s predecessor and father, Pierre Trudeau.

Legault added that he thought the situation in the partially paralyzed national capital of Ottawa was more severe and could justify stricter measures in response.

“I can understand that enough is enough in Ottawa. You can protest, but you can’t do what they’ve been doing for two weeks,” he said.

While the other premiers faced some disagreement from opposition parties in their provinces, Legault’s position was swiftly endorsed by opposition leaders in Quebec. In turn, the National Post on Monday quoted opposition leaders across Canada criticizing Trudeau for invoking the Emergencies Act, either because they opposed the emergency powers as “ham-fisted” or because they thought Trudeau was conceding “failure” by resorting to them.

The National Post also observed that premiers supportive of Trudeau’s emergency powers appeared queasy about using them, demanding assurances that the measures would be exercised for sharply limited periods of time in clearly-defined trouble spots, with full cooperation between federal and provincial officials.

Even the most enthusiastic supporter of Trudeau’s action, Ontario Prime Minister Doug Ford, said he told the prime minister that “these measures should be targeted and time-limited.”

“Those participating in illegal blockades in Ontario and across Canada need to know there are serious consequences for their actions. That is why, similar to the steps our government took last week, I support the federal government in providing additional tools to help police resolve the situation in the nation’s capital,” said Ford, who declared his own provincial state of emergency on Friday.",Police
breitbart,Police,4119,breitbart,"Former President Donald Trump will rally with supporters in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, the same evening President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama will team up for a final rally together ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday.

Trump will campaign with Dr. Mehmet Oz, his hand-selected candidate for the Senate race while Obama and Biden will campaign with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democrat nominee struggling to recover from a stroke that occurred in May.

Biden believes his politics are strongest in Pennsylvania, as he has visited the state on multiple occasions to campaign for Democrat candidates and promote his economic agenda.

“This election is not a referendum. It’s a choice,” Biden told Pennsylvania Democrats at a party dinner last week. “A choice between two vastly different visions of America.”

Biden prided himself on winning Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election after Trump shocked the political world by winning the state and its 20 electoral votes in the 2016 election.

The president continues preaching his belief in taxing the wealthy more and giving the working and middle classes more government benefits, as he says, so they can “just have a little bit of breathing room.”

But as Democrats face tough political headwinds, Biden is reaching out to his old boss for assistance in motivating Democrats to get back to the polls.

The Obama and Biden rally in Philadelphia is where Democrats are making their last stand, hoping that Biden’s first two years as president will inspire Democrats to stand with him despite concerns about crime, inflation, and high gas prices.

But Trump is eager for a rematch, viewing Biden as a weak political force that will collapse in the face of eager Republicans, and some independents who are ready for a change.

Trump is campaigning outside of Pittsburgh, where his political message continues to resonate as rural supporters in the state fly their Trump flags and more aggressive flags denouncing Biden.

As president, Trump famously vowed to represent “Pittsburgh, not Paris” and continues to campaign on making America great again by getting tough on crime, boosting the production of American energy, and lowering inflation.

The showdown in Pennsylvania will signal where the state and the country are going as both Trump and Biden are eyeing their presidential campaigns in 2024.",Police
breitbart,Police,1462,breitbart,"Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) leaped to the defense of President Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee on the second day of her confirmation hearing, favorably questioning her record of “lenient” sentences for defendants who were caught in possession of child pornography.

Durbin, who is the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, started off the hearing by raising questions about Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record of sentencing “non-production” cases below federal guidelines — a line of questioning which was in direct response to Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-MO) Twitter thread last week. In these tweets, Hawley detailed Jackson’s rulings, interviews, articles, and speeches and accused her of “having a pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes.”

Durbin’s first sympathetically queried about how Jackson’s family must have felt hearing Hawley’s accusations before asking her to comment on her judgment in the many cases Hawley detailed in his tweets.

“I thought about his charges as I watched you and your family listening carefully yesterday, and what impact it might’ve had on you personally to know that your daughters, husband, parents, family, and friends were hearing the charges that your implementation of this law, sentencing, endangered children,” Durbin said. “Could you tell us what was going through your mind at that point?”

Jackson maintained that “as a mother and a judge” who has had to rule in those types of cases, she thought that “nothing could be further from the truth.” The nominee offered a lengthy and at times visibly emotional explanation for why she sentenced “non-production” sex offenders below recommended federal sentencing guidelines, a trend which has been increasing among judges, according to a 2021 report from the United States Sentencing Commission.

“The statute [set by Congress] doesn’t say ‘impose the highest possible penalty for this sickening and egregious crime.’ The statute says ‘calculate the guidelines, but also look at various aspects of this offense and impose a sentence that is sufficient but not greater than necessary to promote the purposes of punishment,”‘ Jackson explained.

Upon further prompting from Durbin, who cited fact-checks from corporate media and the National Review as supposed proof that Hawley’s claims are “unfair,” Jackson explained that the original statutory scheme for sentencing these types of sex offenders was created at a time when “more serious child pornography offenders” were judged based on the “number of photographs that they received in the mail.” She added that she believes the guidelines “made total sense before when we didn’t have internet.”

“But the way that the guideline is now structured based on that set of circumstances is leading to extreme disparities in the system because it’s so easy for people to get volumes of this kind of material now by computers,” she said. “It’s not doing the work of differentiating who is a more serious offender in the way that it used to. So, the commission has taken that into account, and perhaps more importantly, courts are adjusting their sentences in order to account for the changed circumstances — but it says nothing about the court’s view of the seriousness of this offense.”

Jackson also said that as a judge, when dealing with these kinds of cases, it was “important to [her] to make sure that the children’s perspectives — children’s voices are represented” in her sentences.

“And what that means, is that for every defendant who comes before me, and who suggests — as they often do — that they’re just a looker, that these crimes don’t really matter, that they’ve collected these things on the internet and it’s fine — I tell them about the victims’ statements that have come into me as a judge,” she said. “I tell them about the adults who were former child sex abuse victims who tell me that they will never have a normal adult relationship because of this abuse. I tell them about the ones who said, ‘I went into prostitution.’ ‘I fell into drugs because I was trying to suppress the hurt that was done to me as an infant.’”

“…I say to them that there’s only a market for this kind of material because there are lookers. That you are contributing to child sex abuse. And then I impose a significant sentence and all of the additional restraints that are available in the law,” she continued.

Hawley’s Twitter thread included several examples of Jackson’s various child porn possession rulings. In one of the cases, United States v. Hawkins, the defendant reportedly “had multiple images of child porn” and was over 18 years old when Jackson sentenced him to three months in prison instead of a sentence of up to ten years, per the Sentencing Guidelines.

“In United States v. Stewart, the criminal possessed thousands of images of child porn and also hoped to travel across state lines to abuse a 9-year-old girl,” Hawley wrote of another case. “The Guidelines called for a sentence of 97-121 months. Judge Jackson sentenced the criminal to just 57 months.”

“In United States v. Sears, the sex offender distributed more than 102 child porn videos. He also sent lewd pictures of his own 10-year-old daughter. The Guidelines recommended 97-121 months in prison. Judge Jackson gave him 71 months,” he continued.

In addition to detailing several other cases, Hawley wrote that Jackson has a “disturbing record for any judge…”

“…But especially one nominated to the highest court in the land. Protecting the most vulnerable shouldn’t be up for debate. Sending child predators to jail shouldn’t be controversial,” he said.

Hawley was scheduled to question Jackson much later in the hearing, which gave Durbin the chance to question Jackson before Republican members of the committee.

The left-wing-aligned “think tank” called Third Way, trying to shift the blame and defeat a major Republican talking point, published a report called “The Red State Murder Problem,” which shows the murder rate per capita was the highest in the six states that voted for Trump in 2020 and the highest in the top eight of ten in the states that voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election this century.

The report claims that the American people should not believe the “attention-grabbing headlines” from news outlets — FOX News, CNN, and the New York Times — giving an example headline, “US cities hit all-time murder records”:

Every news outlet from FOX to CNN to The New York Times to local newspapers has a story with attention-grabbing headlines like “US cities hit all-time murder records.” Fox News and Republicans have jumped on this and framed it as a “Democrat” problem. They blame it on Democrat’s “soft-on-crime” approach and have even referred to a New York District Attorney’s approach as “hug-a-thug.” Many news stories outside of Fox have also purported that police reform is responsible for this rise in murder and have pointed to cities like New York and Los Angeles. The current narrative around crime and murder is convenient and wrong. Whether you’re watching CNN or Fox News, or getting news online or from a traditional newspaper, you would think that the increase in murder is a phenomenon found mostly in liberal cities. Many have tried attributing this increase to Democratic policies, specifically police reform. Republican lawmakers and ad makers have contributed to this narrative through clever messaging and strategies.

In fact, the report from the “think tank” showed that they believe Fox News and Republicans as a whole are trying to play the blame game by saying Democrats have taken the “soft-on-crime” approach despite some national and local Democrats lobbying for defunding the police.

But, it also acknowledged that many news stories indicate “police reform is responsible for this rise in murder and noting that “blue” cities — Chicago, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, and Philadelphia — have seen a “persistent increase in homicides.”

The report claimed, “A more accurate conclusion from the data is that Republicans do a far better job blaming others for high murder rates than actually reducing high murder rates.”

It also noted that the 25 states that voted for Donald Trump had the higher average, 8.20 murders per 100,000 residents, and have not tried to defund the police, while the 25 states that voted for Joe Biden had a lower average, 5.78 murders per 100,000 residents.

The “think tank’s” EVP for policy told Axios: “Republicans seem to do a much better job of talking about stopping crime than stopping crime.”

dailykos,Abortion,4713,dailykos,"I’m posting the latest in a series of updates relating to my airport detention experience (there’s an abortion element here for those of you who haven't read about it already). CBP have changed their story again—and it differs greatly from what their special agent told me on the phone—to say “the correct terminology is pregnancy loss”. I wasn’t asked about ""pregnancy loss"" ever. It was: “Have you had a recent abortion?”

VICE reporting on the phone call I took:

“The questions you were asked were in line with the policies and procedures related to travellers in CBP custody,” the CBP official said. “Under current guidelines, CBP officials are required to collect information regarding potential medical issues, including pregnancy, postpartum and termination of pregnancy to childbearing females in CBP custody. This is done to ensure the health and wellbeing of those under our custody and is a top priority for CBP.” The wording of the special agent conflicts with the CBP’s publicly available policy regarding women of childbearing age, where termination is not mentioned once. It defines pregnancy loss as “stillbirths and miscarriages.”

ProPublica also ran a piece. In it, they were able to highlight other, far more serious problems female detainees have experienced. This one was particularly shocking.

Then, earlier today, I received an email from the US Government's FOIA team saying no records exist in relation to my dealings with CBP at LAX on 30 June 2022. What does everyone think about this? Where does this leave me—the traveller who was refused entry—in terms of getting my deportation paperwork?",Abortion
dailykos,Abortion,4714,dailykos,"Yesterday, in a private Facebook group, I was asked why I, a green-minded innkeeper, am VOTING BLUE today, esp., seeing how the mainstream Democrats seem to represent corporate America to the same extent as the GOPs.



Hochul's main competition (Zeldin) is seriously seedy, and he has openly accepted all the dark money from ""the same folks"" that want to strip American of both its humanity and harmony, not to mention, Democracy, from what little we have left.



Example: There are two big old white GOP goons out here, State Senator Tom O’Mara (R,C,I-Big Flats) and Assemblyman Phil Palmesano (R,C,I-Corning) and that are irrationally up in arms over farmworkers getting overtime pay at 40 hours. They are part of the old boy’s club, out here in the reddest part of NY state.

Also, both of these Republicans are against the Humane Alternatives to Solidarity Confinement Act, otherwise known as the HALT Act.



Here is how Republicans spin their desire to continue the practice of systemic racism, as, ""business as usual.""

O'Mara: “Governor Hochul and her Cuomo-appointed labor commissioner had the opportunity to choose the future of farming over the so-called ‘progressive’ ideology that is driving this state into the ground.""



These two seedy GOPs always represent the big factory corporate farms. To hell with us regular folks! This is why they have so much money in their campaigns. Seedy donors!



My God! As anyone who knows me, I refuse to just VOTE BLUE no matter who. BUT, in this case, Kathy Houchul has earned my vote for her reelection.



No way does Zeldin get my vote. Hell no!! You Go Governor Hochul!

 

 Here is what she had to say regarding Roe vs Wade:



""We have been fighting this battle for too long. I refuse to go backwards. I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights generations have fought for and won, rights that she should be guaranteed.""

“For anyone who needs access to care, our state will welcome you with open arms. New York will always be a place where abortion rights are protected and where abortion is safe and accessible. Just as the Statue of Liberty lifts her lamp tall in our harbor, New York will never stop fighting for what’s right — unafraid and undeterred.”

dailykos,Abortion,4623,dailykos,"I was out of the country in May when news of the SCOTUS leak in which Justice Samuel Alito’s policy statement went viral. I hadn’t watched TV for a week and barely signed onto social media but when I did, I read astute and deeply troubling reactions to the document designed to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has been considered established law for 50 years.

The document Justice Alito wrote was supported by four of his Court colleagues, revealing unsurprisingly that a majority of the Court concurred with ending women’s right to abortion. The timing of the leak was significant; it occurred when the Court was scheduled to rule on the constitutionality of a Mississippi abortion law which prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

If the Court finds that the Mississippi law stands, it will have sanctioned ending Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws regarding abortion. Some states have already established Draconian laws that include charging women with murder if they miscarry or have an abortion. Some have ruled that physicians who perform abortions can be charged with a felony crime and some have set up vigilante laws that could affect anyone who helps a woman get an abortion.

Essentially the demise of the constitutional right to abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy will end women’s right to abortion in over half the states in this country. The implications are huge, not only for American women but for the future of the country, and they are abundantly clear.

Many analysts and pundits have written cogently and urgently about the legal, physical, economic and emotional consequences for women and others in this country, and for all of us with respect to our civil and human rights. As a women’s health educator and advocate I am all too familiar with those consequences. I have heard women’s testimonials, read their memoirs, listened to their stories. I have helped them access abortion care and as a doula I have helped them give birth to much wanted babies.

After the Alito document was revealed (and during the last confirmation hearings) I thought about the great legal minds of the past who had served on the Supreme Court, Justices like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg among them. Now I mourn what has become of that institution, where several judges lied under oath to Congress regarding precedent, and where many are willing to ignore the Constitution’s 4th amendment right of Americans to be “secure in their persons” and to “not be violated or subjected to “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

It pains and frightens me that faulty - some might say puerile logic - superficial, antiquated, cliched justifications, overt sexism, and religious ideology are blatantly on display. (It is worth noting that seven of the current justices are Catholic and no Protestants are on the bench).

Couple that with the less than stellar records and legal experience of several justices, the alleged sexual harassment conduct of two justices, the conflict of interest on the part of a justice whose wife actively supported the insurrection, along with the majority’s willing abrogation of civil and human rights and one can question where “liberty and justice for all” has gone.

How, I ask myself in these traumatic judgment days, has this largely trusted American institution so quickly deteriorated into depravity? How did its majority come to rely on bumper sticker taglines, social media tropes, and arguments so weak and sloppy that they wouldn’t pass muster in a law school? Where has compassionate consideration in difficult matters gone? Why have context, untoward consequences, and the reality of people’s lives disappeared?

The fact is the Supreme Court has become a political organization with its own dark agenda and its reputation will forever be tarnished, all because four men and one woman who should know better, appointed by a far right, self-serving autocrat, are now seated for life on the highest court in the land, along with several hundred inappropriate federal judges.

The price we’ll all pay for judicial travesties, individually and together, grows ever clearer and more threatening. If Roe v. Wade is overturned women’s lives will be destroyed. Precedent in other matters (gay and interracial marriage, LGBTG rights and more) will no longer be valid, and revision of laws that wreak havoc because of ignorance and a taste for punishment will return.

It is no stretch to say that we will become an even more divided and dangerous nation, two-tiered and binary in ways that we can’t yet imagine. Violence is likely to flourish along with racism, anti-Semitism, sexism and increased marginalization. The elderly, young, disabled, and ill will suffer even more profoundly. Murder charges, incarcerations and suicides will become commonplace. Poverty will prevail for those in the 99 percent, while corporations and billionaires flourish. Family structures will be deeply and sadly impacted. The earth will be at risk sooner than predicted.

This is not solely about women’s rights, and it is not hyperbole. It’s a harbinger of what is to come because of laws we must live with, who makes and enforces those laws, who adjudicates disputes, what national priorities are established and by whom. It is about the future, which now is in the hands of the Supreme Court – a court plunged into decline that endangers us all.

It’s a court that is beyond disappointing, a court with extraordinary power to shape our lives, and it grows ever more dangerous.",Abortion
dailykos,Abortion,4610,dailykos,"First, I love Joe Biden. I haven’t changed my opinion of him since day 1. Second, I’m a progressive, but I’m a pragmatist. Biden is not a moderate on the full political spectrum, he’s definitely a Dem. Within the Democratic party, he’s right about in the middle. He wants some (maybe all) student debt forgiveness; he wants some no-cost college options; he is definitely pro women’s rights and pro democracy. He knows he can’t get everything he wants, or the rest of us, but he is willing to fight for some.

He is not a neocon. He got our nation out of its longest war. He has supported the people of Ukraine, way before it was popular. He believes in science, and also his faith. Lots of things I love about Joe. Uninformed people too often blame the president for the inactions of certain senators or congress members, or to anti-democratic filibuster rules, which result in the administration’s goals not being accomplished.

Unless the reproductive rights issue is resolved (somehow) this year, either by eliminating the filibuster or by judicial changes of mind/changes of number (on SCOTUS) … the 2024 presidential/senate/congressional elections will be the biggest fight ever for the individual rights of not only women, but also others that the conservatives have long dreamed of marginalizing.

“Oh, the GOP would never get away with rescinding marriage equality,” some might say. “Too many Americans are fine with it and even supportive.” — Well, 60% or more of Americans think that abortion and contraceptive rights should be legal, even though some of that number may not personally like the thought. And according to the CDC (www.cdc.gov/...), about 65% of women aged 15-49 use contraception. (So, 65% of half of females in the USA, who are about 51% of all Americans.

And only 33% of the Supreme Court is female, none of whom are in that age range.) Wanna gamble on the outcome if they were to rule on it?

If we still need to protect and enshrine, personal, biological and reproductive rights in 2024, I think we must have a female candidate for president. Who? I am not sure. I like Kamala a lot, and she is obviously the best-positioned to mount a campaign, but I am not sold on her ability to connect more widely. And many of the most powerful female politicians that have a national audience, are more senior in age and that might hinder them.

Aside from Kamala, Warren, and Clinton, who do you see as the most viable female presidential candidate if it is necessary — and Joe Biden supports it- to change presidential candidates in 2024? (Let me state again that I am not not not anti-Joe Biden).

If we can prevent this republican attack on human rights in some other way, I want Joe to run again. But if we need to make individual rights the cornerstone of the 2024 elections, our candidate MUST be a woman.",Abortion
dailykos,COVID,4598,dailykos,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) has been running a heavy flight of campaign ads across state TV channels in the past week or so, blaming Democrats and President Biden for high gas prices, deficit spending, and inflation. Even though It's all way too pat and simplistic, I imagine those lies will work on some GOP base voters. Still, they are lies. Even Politifact Wisconsin sees that, so far focusing only on the senator's gasoline-price claims. But trust me, the rest of RoJo's ad is equally misleading. After all:

In four years Trumpublicans including Johnson ran up the national debt by nearly eight thousand billion dollars (for the zero-challenged that's $8,000,000,000,000). Meanwhile that little inconvenience called the COVID pandemic -- which has killed ONE MILLION Americans officially and unofficially up to six times that many -- triggered a giant recession all by itself. Clearly Biden's fault -- not. But Johnson's and Trump's slow and disbelieving reactions surely made the pandemic worse.

And now the Russia-Ukraine war is further ramping up the worldwide supply-chain problem and putting further pressure on prices. But the senator wears blinders to all that and expects you to don a horse halter along with him. Expect to bite hard into the metal bit when The Previous Guy and his minions pull back your reins some more, but don't blame Democratic lawmakers for steering you their way.

Maybe if GOP politicians including Johnson and Trump hadn't praised and coddled Vladimir Putin (and in Johnson's case shown up with other Republican congressmen on Putin's virtual doorstep in Moscow during one American Independence Day), we wouldn't have to deal with that last crisis, which Johnson like other Republicans would like to pin on Biden. Ridiculous. Nevertheless, thanks to the way campaigns and campaign spending now work, ,it will be hard though not impossible to kick this empty suit out of the Senate in November.

dailykos,COVID,4581,dailykos,"In a recent issue of Grasping Reality Newsletter Brad DeLong appears to dismiss current fears by economists across the ideological spectrum and echoed by the mainstream press of runaway inflation in the US economy. He seems to believe the current jump in perceived inflation is simply the economy catching up after the COVID slowdown exacerbated by the lagging gear up of the supply chain

But so far, rising inflation has not been incorporated into any of the “sticky” prices in the economy, according to the measure constructed by the Atlanta Federal Reserve. True, the financial market’s current 30-year breakeven inflation rate, at 2.35%, is more than half a percentage point above where it settled in the second half of the 2010s. But today’s rate is similar to that in the first half of the decade, and slightly below the level that would be consistent with the US Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% per year. The current uptick in US inflation is highly likely to be simply rubber on the road, resulting from the post-pandemic recovery. There is no sign that inflation expectations have become de-anchored. The labor market is still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in real wages. Financial markets are blasé about the possibility of rising inflation. And a substantial fiscal contraction is already in train. Given these facts, why would anybody argue that the “original sin” was the “oversized American Rescue Plan,” and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate it? I, for one, simply cannot follow their logic.

Ryan Avent: Inflation: ‘The carping about inflation really irks me, because I’m not so certain that there is. As noted before, consumer prices are up 6.2% over the past 12 months. It is also the case that real GDP (adjusted for inflation) is up 5% over the past 12 months, and employment is up by about 5.8m jobs. The American economy, notably, has surpassed its pre-pandemic level of economic output while other rich economies, like the euro area, have not. Even so, consumer prices in the euro area have risen by more than 4% over the past year, which is a lot, especially if you’re a German. Had there been less American stimulus, there would have been less inflation, but there would also have been less growth in output and employment. It is possible that less stimulus might have meant a lot less inflation and only a little less of the other stuff. But on the other hand, unemployment is much costlier than inflation, so you really would need quite a lot less inflation for not much less employment growth to break even, so to speak, relative to the reality in which we find ourselves…

While I tend to agree with them regarding the actual state of the economy, I am distressed with their implied recommendation to “leave it alone” and hope that “it will all work out.” Economics and Politics are separate only in the minds of academics. The appearance of doing something, of moving quickly and forcefully to address the perceived crisis even if it is a fantasy is necessary to allow things to work out or most certainly those seeking to profit from the perceived crisis will move the firmament to assure it does not do so on your watch. It is not enough to call a meeting of poobahs or issue press releases that things are or will work out. A distinct specific executive action should be taken immediately claiming it will mitigate or end end the crisis so that when the expected slowing of the perceived inflation bubble occurs it will appear as though it was due to the timely and perceptive action by the chief-executive.",COVID

For example, we entirely missed seeing this:

In a disturbing incident across the street from The Yard, there was a break-in by two men, who assaulted the resident of the upstairs apartment. The local Neighborhood Watch called the Police, who rounded up and arrested the assailants. (The victim suffered broken ribs, but otherwise appears to be doing well.) Chalk one up for the Neighborhood Watch!

In any event, it was incumbent on me to do something about the obscuring shrubbery. Hubby Across-the-Aisle voted to have the Rhododendron ripped out. I vetoed that bill, since removal would entail possible digging near a gas or water line, and the Rhododendron was healthy and doing well where it was, after all. Instead, I issued an Executive Order to trim the Rhodie enough to clear sight lines for VP (Vastly Pleased) Goddard. Again, starting from the bottom and the outskirts, branches were culled.

For those wondering, NO — I did not engage the Melania Trump Landscaping Company to do the trimming. Nor did I order firing an R9X Hellfire missile to slice and dice the Rhododendron as if it were an Al-Queda honcho. (The missile would likely have damaged the gas line as well.) This attempt at Rhododendron Bonsai was all my own effort.

“My name is Rexxmama, President of the Yard:

Due to supply chain issues, I did not paint the plumbing vent as I’d thought I might. I originally envisioned a Day-Glo green paint job with googley eyes, to spook curious feline and canine passersby. I also thought of doing an overall light tan paint job with painted orange or red spots on the cap, to make it look like a poisonous mushroom. Alas, though I was full of ideas, the energy and patience to carry them out in scorching weather were in short supply….. Maybe next year!

On a sad note, The Wandering Yew, which had survived being buried in the darkness by vines growing beneath the Rhododendron, appears now to be deceased after I added potting soil to its pot and placed it in a sunny spot in the Circle Garden. I’m going to leave it and the pot as they are until next season; I’ve read that Yews can put out new growth from old stems, so maybe the nutritious dirt and time will spark a resurgence of growth from the roots and main stem deep within the pot. One can only hope….

dailykos,Climate Change,4594,dailykos,"About an hour ago, the SEC approved a rules proposal to require any SEC publicly registered company to report their carbon emissions in their financial reports. This will open any number of interesting challenges to firms (assuming it survives court challenges — which is a significant risk).

The major requirements are listed by NPR here:

1. They must disclose risks to operations from climate risk — flooding from rising water for waterfront operations, probably insurance claims costs for insurers, etc.

2. They will need to report Scope 1 emissions — emissions from their own operations — and Scope 2 emissions — indirect emissions from generation of purchased energy

The inclusion of Scope 3 emissions — all other emissions not in Scope 1 and 2 — will be required to be reported if “material”.

Here is the nuance — incorrect reporting of information in your financial report is actionable by shareholders. Even more importantly, failing to report “material” information because you determined it to be “immaterial” is also actionable. If a company such as a major retailer were to not disclose any of its Scope 3 because it was ‘immaterial” would just be asking for a lawsuit — because all the emissions from the cargo ships would be Scope 3 emissions for that firm, as well as all the trucks, etc.

This is positioned to force companies to disclose. It is also likely to force them to disclose where they are using offsets — which also makes the offsets being used subject to scrutiny.

• Droughts cause crops to fail & cattle to die.
• Floods mean more generators, higher produce and meat costs, and disrupt supply chains.
• Hurricanes, tornadoes and other more violent storms cause construction, infrastructure and housing costs to rise.

The local Neighborhood Watch called the Police, who rounded up and arrested the assailants. (The victim suffered broken ribs, but otherwise appears to be doing well.) Chalk one up for the Neighborhood Watch!

In any event, it was incumbent on me to do something about the obscuring shrubbery. Hubby Across-the-Aisle voted to have the Rhododendron ripped out. I vetoed that bill, since removal would entail possible digging near a gas or water line, and the Rhododendron was healthy and doing well where it was, after all. Instead, I issued an Executive Order to trim the Rhodie enough to clear sight lines for VP (Vastly Pleased) Goddard. Again, starting from the bottom and the outskirts, branches were culled.

For those wondering, NO — I did not engage the Melania Trump Landscaping Company to do the trimming. Nor did I order firing an R9X Hellfire missile to slice and dice the Rhododendron as if it were an Al-Queda honcho. (The missile would likely have damaged the gas line as well.) This attempt at Rhododendron Bonsai was all my own effort.

“My name is Rexxmama, President of the Yard:

Look on my works, ye Gardeners, and despair!”

Due to supply chain issues, I did not paint the plumbing vent as I’d thought I might. I originally envisioned a Day-Glo green paint job with googley eyes, to spook curious feline and canine passersby. I also thought of doing an overall light tan paint job with painted orange or red spots on the cap, to make it look like a poisonous mushroom. Alas, though I was full of ideas, the energy and patience to carry them out in scorching weather were in short supply….. Maybe next year!

On a sad note, The Wandering Yew, which had survived being buried in the darkness by vines growing beneath the Rhododendron, appears now to be deceased after I added potting soil to its pot and placed it in a sunny spot in the Circle Garden. I’m going to leave it and the pot as they are until next season; I’ve read that Yews can put out new growth from old stems, so maybe the nutritious dirt and time will spark a resurgence of growth from the roots and main stem deep within the pot. One can only hope….

While much was accomplished in the Front Yard, as Gardeners realize, the work is never really completed. There are still Weeds out there, threatening an end to our Edens, that only constant vigil and uprooting will remedy.

Finally, for the sports fans and particularly for the football fans, I leave you with a photo of what I’ve been calling the Moss Brothers — two clumps of moss that were desiccated and scuffed onto the driveway when the weather was hot and dry, only to be revived during the most recent rainstorms. I brought them indoors and have been keeping them moist; I don’t know where they’ll end up…planted outside again, or just kept as indoor plants…but whenever I look at them, they cheer me up for some reason.

Have you had a productive garden season this year, despite the wonky weather? What plans have you for planting Fall crops or bulbs for next Spring? Let us know, with photos as well, if you can.",Climate Change
dailykos,Climate Change,4684,dailykos,"I will state my case strongly and without any kind of reservation.

We have never gained one thing by going low. This is true especially in a time of crisis.

Michelle Obama knew this. President Obama knew this and now President Biden knows this. The Magas want violence and anything to make the Democratic party look bad. We do not need to help them.

Messaging matters on this issue and if we play politics or even appear to as Trump did with Maria, then we lose, hook line and sinker.

Rachel Maddow says, “ Look what they do and not what they say”. Is that not true? It is true. Look what we do and not what we say… Same thing applies.

A divided country with partisan politics is lethal and the fuel to destroy democracy.

This is not the time to get puffed up and say, “Oh look what the Dems did” ? It goes without saying and silence on this matter and just doing is the show me that has been needed for gaslighted people. They may not acknowledge President Biden and give credit to DeSantis but smart, moderate people know the truth.

Leave the Politics alone and start helping your fellow man and woman no matter how stupid we think they may be. They are hurting. We know no party when there are people drowning, losing all their lives of building and loss of life. One party has to be the adults not the junior high folks who say, Look at me… Look and me… It can be done and not said and get the same results if not better.

Trust me, there are some magas who won’t change their minds no matter what but don’t want to starve or go homeless because of alphabet soup of the D’s and R’s.

I voted for Biden for his compassion and being an adult not playing politics. It had been 4 years since we had an adult in the oval office. I want to keep it that way.

I am tired so tired of the bullshit blue and red state theme. We are one country. We are one nation.

Circular development is a regenerative approach to the way in which we design, plan and manage urban ecosystems. It has the potential to help city-regions mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt for climate change. It will ecologically regenerate urban systems; turn cities into producers as well as consumers of resources; and enable them to adapt more easily to the tumultuous changes in the landscape. However, it does incur a whole range of challenges to implementation. Perhaps the greatest of these is the low value the economic system attributes to circular activities, which are needed to address climate change.

Join us in person at Grantham Institute Board room, or watch the online screening at Silwood PArk’s F&H rooms, or online for an intriguing discussion with Prof Jo. There will be time for questions after her presentation and a networking session will follow.

Environmental Destruction: The Effects of War, Pollution & Capital

(In)Justice International are proud to put out a call for attendees and papers/abstracts for our December Workshop which is open to all academics, researchers, students (of any level), Barristers, reporters and people who have lived experienced of the devastating traumas of environmental destruction.

The workshop invites holistic, intersectional approaches relating to war, oppression, pollution, neoliberalism, discrimination and climate change. For example, one could take the influence of capital and, by association, neoliberalism where the drive for profit can create unnecessary pollution across the world. Global organisations often seek the least expensive means of production often characterised by a low paid (poverty stricken) workforce. Allied to the weaker Health and Safety regulations in many countries, productivity targets are often enforced.

As a consequence, any shortcuts that result in greater productivity at the expense of the environment or working conditions are either ignored or encouraged which, in turn, can result in the ‘dumping’ of waste products as opposed to recycling or disposal processes that cost more money. Indeed, this ‘dumping’ tends to take place in the poorer neighbourhoods and, therefore, affects those more susceptible to poverty than more elite sections of society (see https://www.injustice-intl.org/environment).

War on the other hand can result in similarly devastating consequences. The use of heavy ammunition, the raising of buildings and power stations the war has exacerbated levels of pollution. In addition, war intensifies relations appertaining to forced migration (and subsequent discriminatory practices) alongside concerns over energy supplies with those countries that have agreed to zero emissions targets beginning to resort back to the burning of fossil fuels. All-in-all, there is an exacerbation of the causes of climate change and an increase in relative poverty if not absolute poverty.

And with climate change, the poorest are disproportionately affected.

These are but a few of the examples that can lead to both an intersectional and holistic account of the overwhelming havoc being caused by environmental destruction. From whatever the preferred approach of the speaker/researcher on the subject, (In)Justice International welcomes the submission of abstracts.

dailykos,Climate Change,4705,dailykos,"Voters in Nye County, near Las Vegas, could tip the balance in close state and federal contests.

One of the country’s most high-profile efforts by Trump Republicans to avoid using ballot-marking computers in 2022’s midterm elections and instead count votes by hand is coming apart at the seams.

Less than two days after Nye County, Nevada, began a controversial hand count led by an interim county clerk who is a 2020 election denier, Nevada’s Supreme Court and Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, a Republican, issued consecutive orders late on Thursday, October 27, shutting down the operation until after Election Day, November 8.

The twin orders were narrowly focused on a hand count process that interim Clerk Mark Kampf created this fall and debuted on Wednesday, October 26. On its first day, only 50 ballots were hand counted. In the county’s 2020 presidential election, 30,000 ballots were cast by voters, suggesting a full hand count would not finish before the deadlines in state law.

Most of Nye County’s voters are located in its southern tier, which is near Las Vegas. That location makes Nye County a potentially pivotal swing district in one of 2022’s battleground states.

Many of Nevada’s statewide and congressional contests are very close, according to numerous polls, including seats now held by Democrats. Among those are one U.S. House seat and a U.S. Senate seat.

The Nevada Supreme Court order agreed with an emergency motion filed by the ACLU of Nevada earlier on October 27 that contended that the counting process violated other state election laws that require vote counts to remain secret until after Election Day.

The process created by Kampf, which led the ACLU to sue earlier in October, had two people reading aloud the choices made by voters on their ballots, and three other individuals tallying those results. When the hand count commenced on October 26, six teams counted 50 ballots and nearby observers—including ACLU lawyers—heard the voters’ choices. The observers also witnessed many counting errors, causing the teams to recount votes multiple times.

Nevada’s Supreme Court said that reading aloud the results violated state law and ordered the county to cease immediately. It also ordered the county and secretary of state to work out another hand count process that would begin after the November 8 Election Day.

“Observers may not be positioned so as to become privy to the ballot selections and room tallies,” the court’s October 27 order said. “The specifics of the hand-count process and observer positioning so as not to violate this mandate is for respondents and the Nevada Secretary of State to determine.”

However, the secretary of state’s rebuke implied that the state and county might not agree on an acceptable hand count process.

“The current Nye County hand counting process must cease immediately and may not resume until after the close of polls on November 8, 2022,” said Cegavske’s October 27 letter. “Further, no alternative hand counting process may proceed until the Secretary of State and Nye County can determine whether there are any feasible ‘specifics of the hand-count process and observer positioning’ that do not ‘violate [the Supreme Court’s] mandate.’”

The issues at the center of the two orders are not the only problems shadowing Nye County’s handling of the 2022 general election.

In the 2020 presidential election, roughly three-quarters of the county’s voters supported Donald Trump. In late 2019, Nye County’s supervisors declared the county was a “Second Amendment sanctuary,” meaning that its citizens could carry weapons into public buildings.

On October 26, a female election worker with a gun tried to confiscate the notes being taken by an ACLU observer. That incident was not the subject of orders by the state Supreme Court and secretary of state.

There are other issues. Voting Booth visited several early voting sites in other rural Nevada counties. Those counties, which are less populous than Nye County, appeared to have far more electronic voting stations per site than Nye County, where Kampf has opposed using the ballot-marking computers.

How insufficiently deploying election equipment will affect the county’s voter turnout is an open question whose impact remains to be seen.

dailykos,Economy,4608,dailykos,"Fire….wildfires….nothing terrifies more people than the thought of being trapped in a fire. The loss of human life, wildlife and destruction of land and property is now in the billions every year due to wildfires. Much like hurricanes in the south the west has seen a steady increase in this natural disaster. Along with the growing number of fires is the growing increase in their size, strength and length of time they last. Add the massive increase in property damage and the domino effect it costs our economy and the current policy of putting out the fires after they start is not sustainable. If there was a way to prevent or even decrease this yearly nightmare wouldn’t it be prudent to explore that?

Wild horses have been here for over a million years and have helped prevent wildfires. There was once a healthy population of millions roaming throughout North America. According to some new studies these catastrophic wildfires we are seeing now did not exist for millions of years when we had huge populations of native herbivore. As human population increased and expanded into the wilderness the population of herbivores dropped. We are now down to a drastically reduced population that actually needs to increase in order to save the ecosystem from total collapse.

One of the problems with government policy is how they cherry pick what species to ‘save’ and which to sacrifice. The reality is all species are sacrificed by these failed policies. One of the most obvious failed policy is the Wild Horse & Burro program. Though full legal protection was granted in 1971 the law designed to protect what was a healthy population at the time was never enforced. In 50 years it has never lived up to its intent or mission. No sooner was the Wild Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act signed by former President Nixon than various interest groups started to amend and nullify its intent. Wild horses and burros have been brutally rounded up, abused and sold into slaughter ever since with the blessing of the agency paid to protect them, the rogue Bureau of Land MISmanagment.

Losing our native horses is bad enough but to lose a natural resource that had helped to prevent countless wildfires is another. For all the supposed wisdom of the US Forest Service they have chosen to fill our public lands with non native livestock while exterminating our native wildlife that keeps the forest healthy. This has been a major cause for the increase in wildfires we see today. As we continue to kill off our horses, burros, deer, elk the annual number of wildfires has nowhere to go but up.

There is a way to save our wild horses and help prevent these fires but it will take backbone from politicians and government. It is a very simple idea, just stop the brutal wild horse roundups, stop destroying them with toxic birth control and put them in wilderness areas where there are still predators to keep their population in check. Wild horses have always had predation by wolves, bears and cougars but as those species get hunted to extinction the entire nature order will collapse. This will no doubt bring on more wildfires more death and more devastation. We will have no one to blame but ourselves for refusing to accept nature as nature is intended.

Learn how this natural resource we are losing rapidly due to failed policies of the government can help prevent one of the most terrifying natural disasters. click here for the full interview with William E. Simpson ll on the Wild Horse Fire Brigade and how this can help prevent deadly wildfires

More food for thought on wildfire costs and failed policies. “THE COST OF WILDFIRE is often measured in lives lost, buildings destroyed, and acres burned. In California alone, the 2020 wildfire season had, as of mid-October, killed more than 30 people, destroyed some 8,500 structures, and torched a record-breaking 4 million acres of land—double the acreage burned in 2018, the state’s second-worst wildfire season on record.

But the total cost of wildfire extends well beyond these three metrics, starting with the money it takes to contain or suppress the fires—a figure that has grown significantly over the past three decades. There are also less quantifiable metrics that may be even more costly: disruptions to business, taxes, and tourism; residents left with soaring medical bills; and polluted air, soil, and waterways. Federal wildfire suppression costs in the United States have spiked from an annual average of about $425 million from 1985 to 1999 to $1.6 billion from 2000 to 2019, according to data from the National Interagency Fire Center.” The US cannot sustain these costs we will have to get the money from somewhere else to keep paying for all this or keep raising taxes.

Nature knows best and has been around since the beginning of time. The more humans interfere the worse we make things. We can save our wild horses our forests and our homes but it will take a collective battle to make it happen. Let’s hope this happens before we lose the few wild horses we still have left.",Economy
dailykos,Economy,4580,dailykos,"Back in November, I met someone who was running for the town board where I live. He was actually campaigning, as a Republican, for a seat on the board. I must point out that the town, where I live, is a heavily Republican town outside of staunchly Democratic Rochester, New York. I politely told the man that I was a Democrat and would not support him. He asked me if I would consider voting Republican in the local election. Instead of just saying no, I went ahead and explained my position.

I told him that I grew up in a family where both of my parents were Democrats and my father worked in a factory and belonged to a union. Because my father belonged to a union, we weren’t wealthy but we never wanted for anything. I had severe asthma when I was younger and was frequently admitted to the hospital, or receiving treatment at home from my pediatrician (that was back in the days when doctors made house calls). All of this was covered by insurance that the union fought for and Republicans fought against.

I then told him I was gay and I was married to my husband, who is from Malaysia and now a U.S. citizen. I told him that ever since I realized I was I can remember how hard the Republican party fought to deny gays basic human rights, including the right to marry the one they loved. I went on to tell them that I had to move to Malaysia to be with my partner because Republicans would allow him to join me in this country. I told him that Republicans, for years, had prevented gays from visiting their partners if they were hospitalized, because there was no recognized familial relationship.

I reminded him how the Republican icon, Ronald Reagan, ignored the Aids Epidemic, while tens of thousands of gays died because the epidemic had not yet hit the straight white population. Reagan also eliminated the Community Mental Health Systems Act, which Carter and the Democrats, had introduced to fund community mental health centers. Today we are still paying for his deliberate negligence with the epidemic of gun violence and domestic abuse.

I told him that now I am older and retired I am living in fear. The Republicans are still trying to destroy my marriage with their attempts to repeal same-sex marriage and as well as legalizing discrimination against the LGBTQ community as well as people of color. I am living in fear that the right to vote will be taken away from my friends and fellow countrymen who happen to be non-white.

As with all senior citizens in this country, I am afraid of getting sick. With the Republicans being owned by big pharma, all but the very rich among us can afford their prescription medication. We are all one sickness away from being financially destroyed. If we were living in any other industrialized nation in Europe, North America, or Asia we would not have to worry about healthcare. I have worked all of my life to be able to retire, but now life has become a gamble. Will I stay healthy and enjoy my life or will I get sick and lose everything I have worked for?

To make matters worse, as I continued my lecture to the Republican hopeful, the money I have worked for and contributed to Social Security now can be taxed if I have invested wisely. Once again thanks to Ronald Reagan, who in 1983 passed a law allowing the IRS to tax social security benefits on 85% of benefits instead of the previous 50%. And don’t forget Reagan cut the corporate tax rate from 70% to 50% and Trump lowered them even more. So who makes up for the loss in revenue? The poor and middle class, of course! In all of my 73 years in this country, nothing from the numerous tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations ever trickled down to me.

In 2016 the Republican party gave me Donald Trump as president (with a little help from Russia). During those 4 years, I saw immigrants, people of color, gay people, scientists, Mexicans, and all foreigners, except for the white ones, demonized. I saw the decades-old relationships with our closest allies destroyed. I saw the poor and the handicapped ridiculed, while vicious inhumane dictators were catered to. I saw good decent women defiled. I saw the country divided, as never before. And then finally I saw him attempt a coup to overthrow the new duly elected President to remain in power. And not once did I hear any sitting Republican town board member speak out against Trump’s atrocities!

So Mr. Republican town board wannabe, “Hell No! I wouldn’t vote for any member of a party that vows to destroy me, my marriage or my democracy”!

From the candidate, just an insincere “Thank you”.

Still today I look back on that conversation and wonder, with all that is going on with the revelations of the Trump insurrection, how anyone could vote Republican. If they get their own way we may never have another election in this country.

dailykos,Economy,4685,dailykos,"The full article on Dr. Fine is here→ www.daily-times.com/…

FARMINGTON – Services were Monday in Albuquerque for international energy industry expert and Farmington Daily Times columnist Dr. Daniel Fine, 88, who died Sept. 26 in a Miami hospital following complications due to a surgical procedure, his son, William Fine, said.

Fine, widely acknowledged as an expert in world energy markets and geopolitics, was held in high esteem by many state and regional business leaders. He had been set to give a lecture alongside local businessman T. Greg Merrion in Farmington last month.

“He was pretty great at getting a read at what was coming down the pike,” said Merrion, who recently retired as head of Merrion Oil & Gas. Merrion attended the private memorial service along with Fine’s immediate family and guests that included some legislators and people involved in the state’s energy industries.

Merrion noted Fine’s recent participation in getting the region a Department of Transportation grant to study rail service.

That was one of many projects Fine signed onto during the years he was active in New Mexico’s state government as an energy policy coordinator for former Gov. Susana Martinez, and, later, assisting in other projects.

He lectured in Farmington most recently this summer, discussing developments in the energy markets and Russia's war with Ukraine before an audience in the Henderson Fine Arts Center at San Juan College organized by the nonprofit organization Four Corners Economic Development.",Economy
dailykos,Economy,4638,dailykos,"Instead, the budget expenditures were targeted for (admittedly necessary) repairs and upgrades to the Executive McMansion — specifically, a climate-resistant attic window, and an energy-efficient refrigerator. On a brighter note, the budget debate had enough bi-partisan votes to grant funding for more cookies and treats for VP (Very Paw-pular) Goddard, because he’s a good boy (isn’t he a good boy? Yes, he IS!)

Unfortunately, that still leaves me knee-deep in weeds out front, with weed removal and plant relocation my only recourse for the Front. However, Hubby A.t.A. is considering a separate Yard Improvements Project that would replace the tattered pergola covering for the Backyard Patio, but that is stuck in committee at present. I might still be able to earmark to that (or to a future Backyard budget bill) an Arts & Crafts Grant, supplying support for underfunded artists and sculptors, via adding interesting garden decor to the Front. (I expect some pushback on the idea, but can counter with a proposal for daily soup dinners — which would lessen the expenditures on comestibles for the McMansion, despite Hubby’s ardent dislike of soup. Everything is politics around here, I tell ya!)

On a vexing note, there were several small outbreaks of insurrection by the Cardamine Hirsuta Boyz (shot weed — leftovers from the Former Gardener in the Backyard), armed with military-grade projectile seeds and hair-trigger dispositions. I did consult with the DOJ, but everyone there said there was no basis for legal action against plants, leaving me little choice but to go to the DHS for help. However, their only suggested fix would be to utilize this guy:

Loathe to let HIM loose, I decided I would simply dig deeper to get at the root of the problem in the Front Yard — unchecked growth of vegetal sedition overrunning and obscuring the Vision and Promise of the Front Yard. Thus began the J 6 Shearings.

Well, not really…which is why the Front Yard is in the state it’s in now. The very idea of weeding ticks me off; why is it the nice flowers aren’t dominating the garden, but the weeds are? Because…the Gardener hasn’t kept the weeds in check. So — I’m ticked that I have to weed, ticked at myself for not doing it sooner, and the more weeds I’m confronted with, the more ticked off I get.

My first instinct is to pull the weeds that are taller and look like they’re going to seed anyway, and for the most part those are easy pickings. But they leave behind mats of roots that, if left alone, continue to undermine the garden. Yet to get to those mats, there’s a strategy that all Gardeners know — you have to start yanking from the periphery and work your way to the center of this vegetal insurrection. Reaching down along the edges, pulling apart the root mat inch by inch — uncovering lost bulbs and creepy bugs in the process — until you finally reach a point where a big section of this root mass is weakened and gives up its hold on its dirty underpinnings. Now you can see some progress, and it feels so good when you can consign those awful piles of weeds and roots to the compost bin of history.

Of course, some innocent plants get hurt, too. Spring bulbs are unearthed, and sometimes the roots of good plants are entwined with the weed roots. Some soil still clings to the weed roots and will need to be replenished, as Gardeners amend their growing beds. Nothing of any worth is easy, and the results may not always be pretty. Yet in the long run I think it’s better for the future of the Yard and its citizens.

dailykos,Economy,4600,dailykos,"I don’t to be an alarmist but it doesn’t look for our party right now There are two reason for this . Inflation and Fuel Prices. Yes, it get it. The president can do little about it and has no direct control. President Biden just release a huge military reserve which hopefully will stabilize prices. What congress can control are the Federal Taxes .

The taxes and other fees on retail gasoline and diesel fuel, in cents per gallon, as of January 1, 2022 are:

Federal taxes include excises taxes of 18.3 cents per gallon on gasoline and 24.3 cents per gallon on diesel fuel, and a Leaking Underground Storage Tank fee of 0.1 cents per gallon on both fuels. State taxes include rates of general application including, but not limited to, excise taxes, environmental taxes, special taxes, and inspection fees, but they exclude state taxes based on gross or net receipts. State taxes do not include county and local taxes. This information is for general informational purposes only.

If these taxes were temporally removed, this should bring prices down . The revenues can be made up in other places. What is will show is we are doing something . We care (we do) Let the Republicans try to stop this . People are hurting out there and the Republicans are great at being an “opportunistic infection” They are good at taking advantage of a bad situation. Of course they have no solution except reducing taxes on the wealthy and gutting environmental regulation But that’s what they do.

An 18 cent reduction per gallon of gasoline is significant to show we are doing something and but some much needed time and maybe some approval

dailykos,Economy,4589,dailykos,"CNN and other outlets are reporting that former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud case against him because the prosecutors are “politically motivated” and are out to get him and Trump. Weisselberg also argues that the city and state of New York have no jurisdiction over federal income tax matters. And the icing on the cake is that Weisselberg was granted immunity for his grand jury testimony against Michael Cohen, so prosecutors cannot use anything he said in his grand jury testimony.

Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud indictment against him, saying it violates the immunity he was given in the federal investigation into Michael Cohen, a former personal attorney to former President Donald Trump, and that certain charges fall outside of the statute of limitations. Weisselberg’s attorneys also argued in the 162-page brief that the Manhattan district attorney and New York attorney general have targeted Trump, Weisselberg and the Trump Organization. In the filing, his attorneys argue that New York authorities were politically motivated in pursuing the indictment last summer charging them with a 15-year tax fraud scheme. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty. The motion to dismiss comes as the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office continues to investigate the Trump Organization and its executives about the accuracy of financial statements provided to lenders, insurers and others. Last week, a New York judge ruled that Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump need to testify in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into the Trump Organization’s finances. Trumps attorneys have vowed to appeal. In arguing for the dismissal, Weisselberg’s lawyers write, “Mr. Weisselberg’s federal grand jury testimony forged the first link in the chain of evidence that culminated in this Indictment.” The lawyers argued that Cohen had embarked on a campaign driven by “vengeance” against Weisselberg and cooperated extensively with the district attorney’s office, suggesting the internal nickname for the investigation is “fixer,” a nod to Cohen’s self-proclaimed title.

First up, I’d like to know what judge is considering Weisselberg’s petition to have all charges dismissed. I assume it is a judge from New York, considering The Trump Organization is getting hit from both the Manhattan DA and the New York State Attorney General Tish James. And this sounds like a typical legal stalling tactic from Trump, and Weisselberg is Trump’s Sith apprentice.

But I had wondered what was going through Weisselberg’s head when it came to the charges arrayed against him. Remember when people thought that Weisselberg would flip? I even thought he would. He’s an old guy, and why should he go to prison for Trump?

However, Weisselberg is determined to tough this out. I’m just guessing here, but I think that Weisselberg has picked up a bunch of tricks from Donald Trump over his decades of service to the Dark Lord. Weisselberg has witnessed Trump evade legal jams from the beginning of time, so why couldn’t Weisselberg do the same?

And this petition has all the gall of a Trump acolyte.
• Throw all kinds of “legal” arguments at the wall to see which one sticks.
• Emphasize “You cannot touch be because of matter X!”
• And be dishonest during the entire process.

Here is where that last point comes in:

CNN previously reported that federal prosecutors suspected Weisselberg was not entirely truthful during his grand jury testimony and considered charging him with perjury. Weisselberg was granted partial immunity for his testimony about hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal crimes, including campaign finance charges… Weisselberg’s attorneys also asked the judge to suppress statements Weisselberg had made while he was in custody for eight hours the morning he surrendered to face the charges. While in custody, Weisselberg made statements about living in Manhattan and the high cost of schooling – issues at the heart of the indictment. His attorneys say those statements were compelled in violation of his constitutional rights.

I don’t know how much evidence the prosecutors have on Weisselberg, but unless he finds a really corrupt judge, I think his petition for dismissal will be rejected. There is a paper trial from what I have read. But no matter, the point is to stall and throw as much sand as possible into the slow wheels of the justice system.

As to why Weisselberg has resurfaced now, this may have something to do with it:

This is a “limited deposition,” but the Trump lawyers were having a hissy fit that the judge is compelling Weisselberg to cough up any knowledge he has about the Trump Inauguration Committee. This tends to get forgotten, but the DC Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against the Trump Inauguration Committee for ripping people off.

Anyway, I expect Weisselberg will lie or plead the Fifth during this deposition.

dailykos,Economy,4662,dailykos,"In 2018, 60 of the largest companies in the USA paid no taxes - ZERO - on pre-tax income of 79 billion dollars. No American citizen is, or anyone else either, can remain on the moral right side of history who find this fact remotely acceptable. It is not aceptable. It is immoral, unethical, hateful and is destroying the very fabric of our society. This has occured and is even still being promoted and pushed to even further extremes as a good thing by the deranged Republicans, this is their platform. The actual platform of the Republican party.

Can they not see how this will bring about the downfall of society overall, and pretty darn quickly, if we do not kindly and respectfully remind our families, friends and aquaintances of this truth until they understand it? This deranged, insane behavior is far past the level of any red-side/blue-side political opinion. It has become an existential problem. This problem is far beyond any simlple difference in views as to how we can best run our society.

I know it is almost impossible for some to recognize, but the differences in the stated intentions of the Republicans and the Democratic parties are dreadfully frightening. The Republicans are openly stating their support for fascism and stripping our citizens of their rights ensconced in the Bill of Rights and our constitution. They are literally, openly embracing the disgraceful, shameful and horryfying ideology of the likes of Putin, Mussolini and Hitler, they openly and without shame want to appoint Trump as a dictator and change the USA into a full on fascist governent. Folks, this is not even close to democracy. Republicans are openly supporting getting rid of democracy.

They are no longer even trying to deny that this is their aim. We must fight back or they will do what they are stating that they will do! They try to pain Democrats as ”far left,” but the rest of the civilized world just laughs at that description as a complete, even laughable fiction. Even our beloved Bernie Sanders (and yes, he is beloved to me and millions of other progressives) is considered a “center-right,” politician for most of the rest of the world. And our radical right is simply so far off the deep end into the depths of the far-right, they can no longer be considered rational at all. They are simply extremists without any moral compass.

And the short-sited money makers in the slanted and corrupt financial systems will blithely collect their pathetically oversized compensation, while the country, Democracy and the rest of the world is strangled, starved of oxygen/the truth and simply dies. Lied to with the big lie, until death. Because for these greed filled, rationalizing enablers, the destroyers of our world, they believe that they cannot do anything to change anything or do anything that may help. They have tried absolutely nothing at all and they are all out of ideas. After all, even if they did start taking the high road and began to do the right thing individually, someone else will just step in and do what they were doing, right? Age old poor excuse and no better for it being so remarkably short sited and wrong.

Where I live, (Tucson, AZ) climate change has begun to make going outside between 10:30 am and 5 pm a life threatening endeavor. And that is not just because of the risk of Covid, although that is another real danger (thanks Drumph and magats). No, now it is also true that we risk heat stroke to be out of doors for any length of time during the daylight hours. (Not to mention the climate change derived severe drought as it stands to deprive us of water if we do not change things in a major way, like, right now.)

But I suppose we are all OK with the ever increasing risk to our health and not being able to safely go outside during the day anymore. Just so long as the Koch family, the Mercers, Waltons, The Murdochs the Bushes the Manchins and the magat Republicans overall can have a few extra billion dollars in their stuffed full to overloading offshore bank accounts that will make absolutely ZERO difference to them in real life. May they choke on it.

Their greed is crippling us. Killing us. Literally. It is long past the point of them being somewhat too greedy. Their greed is literally killing people and anyone who doesn't see that is either outright lying about it, or has blinders on of a kind that has disabled any ability they may have once had to be rational.

dailykos,Economy,4643,dailykos,"Why do Democrats often seem so poor in political messaging? Why do they seem so often willing to go after one another on issues rather than Republican’s, Conservative’s, and the greedy plutocracy. I think it was Will Rogers who when asked which political party he belonged to responded, “I belong to no political party, I’m a Democrat.”

While that openness to debate, convictions and interests makes the party what it is and why I am a Democrat, we are at a time in our democracy so perilous that perhaps it is time to distinguish between ideological debates to set policy and messaging to win elections.

Perhaps It is time to change the way the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates campaign. Frankly messaging by the Democratic Party and its candidates for the most part sucks. The time for presenting elaborate plans and programs to the electorate during elections has passed, at least for the time being. We are in the midst of a national existential crisis. Neither government nor politicians are trusted. Neither the electorate nor the media appear to be able to handle, understand or communicate complex proposals for often poorly understood problems. The electorate and the media require brief concise statements that the least sophisticated of them can understand and communicate. Most voters do not really care how you are going to do what you promise, nor will they understand it. Republicans learned this long ago. Frank Luntz taught them, and for the most part it worked. It is time for Democrats and progressives to do so too.

I make no claims to being a qualified political consultant, but here are some suggestions (and they are only suggestions) for Democratic talking points that could be used during the 2022 midterms and perhaps even the 2024 elections.

save your children from the threat of death from government supported weapons of war;

 make you, your family, and your neighbors safe in your homes, in shopping centers, and in the streets of the nation from those same weapons of war;

 protect you from governmental control of your bodily functions and restore a woman’s right to choose.

 reduce Republican caused inflation.

 restore to all Americans their right to vote in free and fair elections.

 restore our nations schools and universities to the best in the world and assure every child in the nation access to the education they need.

 provide fairer taxation for all Americans

punish all those who sought to overthrow our democracy on January 6 and pass laws necessary to assure it never happens again.

Republicans from taking away your social security and your medicare;

 government subsidies of energy developments that destroy our nation’s climate:

 Republicans from eliminating Social Security for our elderly;

 Republican’s plan to eliminate Medicare;

 Republican increases in the national debt;

 ` Republican war on our nation’s public schools;

 Republican assaults on our right to vote.

 attempts to destroy our representative democracy by insurrection or subterfuge.

 fraud in our elections.

 attempts to deny any American their rights to equality of opportunity and respect.

 government from imposing unfair taxes on Americans by, among other things, closing unfair tax loopholes.

Each meme should be used separately as needed. For example, “I will fight to make your children in school free from the threat from government supported weapons of war,” or “The Republican Party and the manufacturers of these weapons of war are killing your children as they sit in their schools. It is time to rid our schools of that threat.”:

 

 This is not a complete list; there may be interests and policies not specifically mentioned here. I expect those more knowledgeable and experienced than I can identify them. But it should be noted that some policies and and ideas may be better saved for debate before a Democratic controlled legislature than in an election where the electorate most likely neither cares nor understands the issues and attempts at explanation risks both boredom and misunderstanding.

Try your own list of memes. Remember in politics the briefest meme wins.",Economy
dailykos,Economy,4715,dailykos,"As a marketing and communications consultant I keep it real for my clients. I will do the same here. Caveat here is this can change with attention. Some immediately, others are more baked in and call for some serious self reflection by the Democratic Party. We have learned more about the political landscape in the past ten years than ever in due to the transparency of Republicans regarding their true intentions. By Elevating Trump they essentially gave up the game and decided live with it. Now it could be said Republicans paid a price by what happened Tuesday. Arguably true regarding this cycle, to a point. I don’t they they suffered as much as warranted given all the negatives they took on. After all, their party essentially sided with an overthrowing of the government. I see some daylight for them down the road if Democrats don’t address some foundational changes in voting habits.

1. The merchants of power behind the Republican Party are officially dumping Trump. They never cared much for their useful idiot anyway. He served his purpose. They found his successor down in Florida. A new Dark Lord in Ron DeSantis.

 2. Democrats are incrementally losing Hispanic voters. It’s happened the last 4 election cycles.

 3. Younger voters turned out in higher numbers than usual because there were things at stake they cared about, abortion and climate. It’s not a block that Democrats can count on consistently however.

 4. We learned that Florida and Ohio are permanently gone for Democrats in national elections. Tim Ryan was the best candidate Democrats will ever run in OH yet he got beat by 10 points by a phony lightweight. Those states are not swing states.

 5. It appears white voters aren’t ready to elect black senators in predominantly white population states like Wisconsin. Mandela Barnes was undeniably superior to Johnson in every possible way a human can be.

 6. White women in the suburbs now reliably vote Republican. it’s a problem for Democrats.

 7. Arizona is now a reliable swing state for Democrats.

 8. What happened in 2020 in Georgia seems to be an anomaly. It returned to it’s normal voter profile in 2022. That Walker is almost tied with Warnock is the tell.

 10. Texas has a terrible Governor and most unpopular Senator (maybe person) in America. Beto is as good a candidate as Democrats have anywhere and he can’t make a dent in Texas. Texas is still off the table for Democrats.

dailykos,Economy,4592,dailykos,"The latest inflation report says that prices rose 7.5 percent over the past year, the highest inflation rate in 30 years. And according to the corporate media, it's all because of Joe Biden and government spending. In fact, one of the biggest drivers of inflation is something the mainstream media never talks about at all: the outsized power of corporations. Just two companies, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, dominate the market for household paper products like diapers and toilet paper. Four large meat-processing conglomerates control the prices of beef, pork, and poultry. And don't get me started on Amazon and Walmart. These companies aren't raising prices because they have to. They're raising prices because they can. But the American people aren't hearing any of this, and that's a big, big problem. Because if the voters don't get the real story about monopolistic power and what's causing inflation, they won't know what solutions to demand from their elected officials. Worse yet, they just might end up rewarding the very corporations responsible for the problem by electing a Republican majority in Congress—whose corporate campaign donations ensure they won't break up corporate monopoly power. If markets were truly competitive, companies would need to keep their prices down in order to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. But greedy corporations are raising prices even as they rake in record profits. How can this be? The answer is that they have so much market power they can artificially drive up prices with impunity. Again: The lion's share of the market for toilet paper is controlled by just two companies: P&G and Kimberly-Clark. So last April, when they jacked up prices, we had no choice but to pay up. Or consider another consumer product duopoly—PepsiCo (the parent company of Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, Tropicana, and other brands), and Coca-Cola. In April, PepsiCo announced it was increasing prices. Then, just like clockwork, its only major competitor announced similar price hikes. In every case, the companies blamed higher costs on labor, freight, and raw materials. But in every case, these companies were also recording record profits, and their CEOs were raking it in. In other words, they're lying to you. They're using ""inflation"" as an excuse to price gouge and fatten compensation packages for their executives. Here's the thing. Turning dry economic concepts into social media content that that people (including young folks) will actually watch is a huge task! But the brilliant creative team at Inequality Media Civic Action has figured it out—and they continue to exceed my expectations. Plus, we've built an online audience of more than 6.5 million followers, including a surprisingly large number of conservatives and independents. So we can reach the people we need, even as viewing habits change and attention spans get shorter, with a small team on a shoestring budget.",Economy
dailykos,Economy,4640,dailykos,"Instead, the budget expenditures were targeted for (admittedly necessary) repairs and upgrades to the Executive McMansion — specifically, a climate-resistant attic window, and an energy-efficient refrigerator. On a brighter note, the budget debate had enough bi-partisan votes to grant funding for more cookies and treats for VP (Very Paw-pular) Goddard, because he’s a good boy (isn’t he a good boy? Yes, he IS!)

Unfortunately, that still leaves me knee-deep in weeds out front, with weed removal and plant relocation my only recourse for the Front. However, Hubby A.t.A. is considering a separate Yard Improvements Project that would replace the tattered pergola covering for the Backyard Patio, but that is stuck in committee at present. I might still be able to earmark to that (or to a future Backyard budget bill) an Arts & Crafts Grant, supplying support for underfunded artists and sculptors, via adding interesting garden decor to the Front. (I expect some pushback on the idea, but can counter with a proposal for daily soup dinners — which would lessen the expenditures on comestibles for the McMansion, despite Hubby’s ardent dislike of soup. Everything is politics around here, I tell ya!)

On a vexing note, there were several small outbreaks of insurrection by the Cardamine Hirsuta Boyz (shot weed — leftovers from the Former Gardener in the Backyard), armed with military-grade projectile seeds and hair-trigger dispositions. I did consult with the DOJ, but everyone there said there was no basis for legal action against plants, leaving me little choice but to go to the DHS for help. However, their only suggested fix would be to utilize this guy:

Loathe to let HIM loose, I decided I would simply dig deeper to get at the root of the problem in the Front Yard — unchecked growth of vegetal sedition overrunning and obscuring the Vision and Promise of the Front Yard. Thus began the J 6 Shearings.

Well, not really…which is why the Front Yard is in the state it’s in now. The very idea of weeding ticks me off; why is it the nice flowers aren’t dominating the garden, but the weeds are? Because…the Gardener hasn’t kept the weeds in check. So — I’m ticked that I have to weed, ticked at myself for not doing it sooner, and the more weeds I’m confronted with, the more ticked off I get.

My first instinct is to pull the weeds that are taller and look like they’re going to seed anyway, and for the most part those are easy pickings. But they leave behind mats of roots that, if left alone, continue to undermine the garden. Yet to get to those mats, there’s a strategy that all Gardeners know — you have to start yanking from the periphery and work your way to the center of this vegetal insurrection. Reaching down along the edges, pulling apart the root mat inch by inch — uncovering lost bulbs and creepy bugs in the process — until you finally reach a point where a big section of this root mass is weakened and gives up its hold on its dirty underpinnings. Now you can see some progress, and it feels so good when you can consign those awful piles of weeds and roots to the compost bin of history.

Of course, some innocent plants get hurt, too. Spring bulbs are unearthed, and sometimes the roots of good plants are entwined with the weed roots. Some soil still clings to the weed roots and will need to be replenished, as Gardeners amend their growing beds. Nothing of any worth is easy, and the results may not always be pretty. Yet in the long run I think it’s better for the future of the Yard and its citizens.

Please share what you’ve been digging up in your own gardens!",Economy
dailykos,Economy,4732,dailykos,"As some of you know, I have been out of pocket for about 2–3 weeks with a malfunctioning computer. i just got back on on Monday and locked into my favorite sites and started trying to catch up on the news. I found some interesting information that gives me hope for the continuation of the Democratic Republic that we live in. It seems that the chances are that Justice will be done and we will finally establish, hopefully, once and for all, that NOBODY, no matter what their position in our leadership, is above the law. That is something that should make us all proud. The sad thing is that some that think they would benefit from the failure of Justice and the following of law, won’t be happy.

But let’s just continue to look at the good things that have happened over the last month and rejoice that Justice looks like it might well prevail. First of all the House Ways and Means Committee has managed to get ahold of trump’s taxes, at least for the last six (6) years. Oh and remember how he kept swearing he couldn’t disclose them because they were under audit? Well, first of all, their being under audit is no reason that the returns couldn’t have been releases, but in addition, there is no reason to believe that they were ever under audit in any case, because they certainly haven’t been for the last six (6) years even though for years 2017 though 2020, they SHOULD have been under audit because there is a provision that requires auditing of the person in the two top offices of the executive branch.

The next step on that particular issue is to determine WHY trump’s taxes weren’t audited for those four years. Did trump use his power to stop the audit? Or did the IRS simply forget or for other reasons failed to follow though on their mandated action. One extenuarating circumstance is that no other President in recent memory has ever flatly refused to share those documents so the issue was never that big a deal. But then, we know that trump never misses any dodge he can come up with.

The second bit of excellent news is that the Jan 6th Committee, which is bipartisan despite the House Republicans attempts to stop the process, has made their final determination and referred four (4) charges to the DOJ for continued investigation which many of us have been hoping would end up with criminal punishment requiring either financial penalties or jail time for his attempted insurrection against the rightly elected government of the United States. At the absolute least, this man should never be allowed within the government ever again, as even Liz Cheney said, he is NOT fit for office.

The criminal charges they are referring to the DOJ against trump are:

1. obstruction of an official procedure by congress

4. Making a false statement (I suspect this might more quickly be referred to as the Big Lie)

Eastman, his lawyer has also had charges on two of these four items. Hey, John Smith, let’s see ya do your job with this additional information.

There are charges also being referred against four (4) House of Representative members for their refusal to abide by House Rules in preforming their duty to the nation. Those four representatives are Bigs, Jordan, Perry and the presumptive leaders of the next House, McCarthy for their refusal to reply to subpoenas sent by the Committee.

Thus far, everything has been on the Federal level, however, Justice is coming after trump on more than just that. The Federal Courts in Florida have ruled that trump’s attempt to have them turn the AG of New York’s actions against him overturned are without value or merit. Anybody understanding courts should have known that the courts of Florida have no power to change the actions or decisions of those of another states. You would think as a right wing enterprise, the trump brigade would have been especially clear on that, but apparently, sheer ambition and the desire to get their way overcame their good sense and knowledge of the law, but anyway, that is another piece of wonderful news. Now he will have to deal with New York on New York issues, an with Georgia on Georgia issues, as it should be.

Now, here’s a bit of laugh out loud news. It seems that there is turmoil and bad feelings between two of the most active of the domestic terrorist groups that participate in Jan 6th’s attempted insurrection. Apparently Enrique Tarrio has issues with the Oath Keepers, says he doesn’t like those “militia” groups, which is laughable since his group acts just like them. I suspect he is probably just trying to set himself up as not being in collusion with the Oath Keepers, but hopefully that won’t get his group out of the trouble they are in.

Now, that caught my attention. I always thought the party had an infrastructure. On more reflection, despite my past and current contacts with elected officials, I realize that the Party’s relationship to me and to most voters who consider themselves Democrats consists of contact by a network of semi-grifter consultants sending panicked fundraising emails of which they get an excessive cut. Sifry suggests the Party consider some things more substantial.

Why is there no democratic party infrastructure?

Micah Sifry: Messaging Won’t Save Democrats; Community Might: ‘Lux and his colleagues found… populist economics: tax the rich, hammer corporations for price gouging and profiteering, bring jobs home, help small businesses against corporate monopolies are all themes that resonate and also offer an answer to voter concerns about rising inflation…. These voters are sick of “partisan bickering” and not receptive to political messages from either part…. This rings true to me. Politics as it is practiced today, in the form of messaging wars on television and online, is just too far from most people’s lives…. “Candidates and party committees should be spending time doing things like sponsoring community events like [Ohio Senator] Sherrod Brown’s ‘movie nights,’ which he does in the old movie theaters of Ohio’s mid-sized towns, where the theme is to build community spirit and togetherness. Or they could set up events that were community health clinics where people come in and get health care assistance that they couldn’t otherwise afford. Or Chautauqua style events, where musicians, community theater performers, poets, and community organizations spend a day in a community.” Even better, I’d add, instead of opening campaign offices for a few weeks, stocking them with fresh-faced volunteers from out of town, and then closing as soon as the election is over, Democrats could invest in year-round community centers like the union halls of old, where people gathered to socialize, have a beer and talk politics. Unfortunately, Lux is a rarity among his colleagues. I don’t think Democrats are likely to shift the tens of millions of dollars they now have slotted for expensive ad campaigns this fall into community fairs or mutual aid programs. They’re going to keep doing what they’ve always done and pray for a different result…

dailykos,Election,4722,dailykos,"Having submitted my final columns for 2022 before the end of November, I looked forward to a holiday respite while contemplating what my first commentary for 2023 might be. My notes suggested global warming, immigration challenges, and the earliest ever election season, which had started a nanosecond after the November election.

Then came four mass shootings in less than a week that killed nearly two dozen people and grievously injured many more. As I write this, the month of November has seen 32 mass shootings nationally while a tally of more than 600 mass shootings have occurred across the country so far. According to the Washington Post in June, mass shootings had averaged more than one per day and not a single week till then had passed without at least four mass shootings. The frightening statistics go on and on as does the increase in gun violence and death in this country: In 2014 there were 243 mass shooting in the first half of the year, in 2022 there were 606.

Clearly, we live in a country besieged by domestic terrorism in the form of unchecked gun violence. It’s a country that mystifies and frightens other civilized nations such that many would-be visitors no longer want to set foot in such a dangerous place of random violence. It is a country in which there is a very real chance that being in the wrong place at the wrong time can cost you or your loved ones their lives. That place could be a school, a place of worship, a workplace, a shopping mall, grocery store, restaurant, lecture or library, concert or club. It is a country bereft as blood runs red in our homes, our places of higher learning, our streets, our nightmares.

In June last year Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), Chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform at the time, held a hearing on the urgent need to address the gun violence epidemic. The powerful words of those who testified speak volumes for all of us who want Congress to stand up to obstructive politicians, rabid lobbyists for the NRA and other destructive organizations and Americans who worship guns no matter who they kill.

Kimberly Rubio, who lost her daughter in the Uvalde slaughter, was one of many people who testified. “Today we stand for Lexi, and we demand action. We seek a ban on assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. We understand that …to some people, people with money, people who fund political campaigns, that guns are more important than children, so at this moment we ask for progress. Somewhere out there, a mom is hearing our testimony and thinking, ‘I can’t even imagine their pain,’ not knowing that our reality will one day be hers, unless we act now.”

Another was Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association. “The impact to the community is forever. … The idea of turning our schools into prisons, into places where they are not conducive to teaching and learning, is not the solution to the problem. We know what the solution to this problem is, it’s comprehensive gun reform.”

Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia, representing the Major Cities Chiefs Association, called for Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban, adopt universal background checks, ban high-capacity magazines, enact red flag laws, and pass other “common-sense reforms that would help law enforcement and other stakeholders mitigate the threat gun violence poses to our communities.”

According to the Pew Research Center, research has shown that the effects of the gun epidemic have led to a mental health crisis in America with rates of depression and anxiety as well as youth suicide rates increasing. “It changes the entire picture on how much public resources we should use to attack gun violence,” Erdal Tekin, co-author of a report in the journal Health Affairs, says. “It would be informative for the public and policymakers to know that the impact of gun violence extends to people who think they are safe.”

It would also be wise, and it is obviously urgent, for Congress to actually legislate, at long last, gun laws that put an end to the travesty of continued gun violence and related deaths. A good start would be to promulgate laws that ban assault weapons nationally as other countries have done, along with other sensible laws aimed at keeping innocent Americans alive.

With Republicans now in control of the House that is a tall order, but it is an order from the vast majority of constituents for both parties. If our elected representatives in Congress ignore our pleas they can expect to be inundated with calls, protest, petitions, and more. They can also expect to lose their seats next year.

If each of us makes a commitment to act, starting now, to end the madness of high-capacity magazines, open carry laws, assault weapons and more, we can collectively save lives while sending a strong message to Congress. Begin bombarding the House and Senate now with calls and petitions and marches. Write letters to the editor. The message is clear: Enough is Enough. Stop the slaughter. End the massacres that shames our nation. Save the lives of loved ones, including your own. End the travesty that tarnishes our names as Americans. And remember the Talmudic teaching: “Whoever saves a single life is considered by scripture to have saved the whole world.' ...",Election

TLDR of my background, Biology Researcher turned Campaign Strategist of over 25 campaigns, turned Campaign Media Guy, and now maybe some light journalism? Who knows.

So, it’s well known at this point that at a national level, Republican fundraising is stalling. Many statewide races that were previously considered up in the air, have been moved to lean-democrat or safe-democrat. Disregarding Ron Desantis’ absurd war chest, the RNC is hurting for cash, and are calling for heads to roll, and the guy at the top is FL Senator Rick Scott (Boo Lizard Man).

But, as someone who does political fundraising for a living, I actually think this isn’t necessarily Rick Scott’s fault. If they want to decapitate him anyway, I’m not going to complain, but that would be a mistake. The actual reason their fundraising is stalling? It sure isn’t aggressive or deceptive emails/text messages, it’s economics, and the messaging they have fed to their base for the last 4 years.

So, let’s get the simple stuff out of the way. There aren’t a lot of Democrats at a national level that refuse to accept money from our corporate overlords, and right now, Dems have a trifecta. An important thing to understand about lobbyists/corporate donors: they don’t have political values, their agenda is their bottom line. As you have to spend money to make money, dollars to Democrats moves the needle in their direction, at least for another 3-4 months, depending on what happens in the midterms. So, that’s very naturally going to pull dollars away from the Republican War Chest. Consistency is good for the bottom line, and right now thanks to a few specific Senate Democrats, any progress has to have a little pork tacked in for the CEOs of America.

The other factor to be considered? The average Republican Mega-MAGA supporter isn’t a ridiculously wealthy human, nor are they the kind of people who like throwing money into a void. Trump fundraised well from these people by selling overpriced merch, charging ticket sales, etc, because Trump wasn’t a politician, or a party, but an entertainer- and these Americans are used to giving their extra cash to be entertained. By catering to the Reality TV market of America, Republicans have gotten the support bracket they wanted- on average less educated, less wealthy, voters, who won’t be swayed as their neo-fascist policies are completely contradictory from the small government messages they preach. But without Trump, there’s no national entertainment face. But… Desantis fills that gap well with his Top Gun themed ads, and “owning the libs stunts” on a weekly basis. People have something to tune in for, and thus will pay for that. Hence Desantis’ insane windfall.

A basic principle of advertising, especially in politics, is that to get people to care, you either have to inspire them, make them laugh, or piss them off. Tuning in for this weeks episode of Ronnie owns the libs followed by 2-3 fundraising emails/texts will get $10 out of your dad, but “Oh boy Senate Republicans want to ban abortion”, give us money so we can fail to get it passed, doesn’t quite do the trick.

I am a gun owner, I have hunted all my life. I have never considered carrying a gun when I am not hunting.

I used to have some ingrained trust in the decisions of SCOTUS, by that I mean I had some vague hope that SCOTUS mights be able to protect Americans from their worst excesses. It’s what I was taught in school from the get go.

What I have come to realize is that SCOTUS has become the most corrupted and powerful branch of the constitutionally defined Government. Its justices are selected upon political, theological and ideological grounds only.

What this means to me:
• My vote actually has less worth than mud.
• Women's’ rights to control our own bodies is null a void.
• Everyone on the street can be seen as an imminent threat to my life, great, it will do my anxiety no favours. Every god-damned rapist could have a gun rather than “just” a knife and muscles, fighting back i.e. resisting will no longer be an “option” but an extreme risk.

I was in Boston a few weeks ago, arranging with my sisters our departed father's affairs, it was the first opportunity we had to be all together. We might have to meet in Canada in the future, US border control can go to hell.

I am considering renouncing my US citizenship, as the only “benefit” it now brings is having to pay for the added costs of lodging my personal expat tax forms. I’ll lose the right to vote in VT, big deal./s

dailykos,Election,4578,dailykos,"It is illogical that anyone could feel that saving the Filibuster is more important than saving our right to vote, our democracy & the constitution. That is why I have a couple questions for you both. First: You do know that Majority leader, McConnell stole the SCOTUS seat from President Obama & Democrats in 2016, after which he ditched the Filibuster in 2017 so Republicans could approve Neal Gorsich for SCOTUS with only 51 votes, don’t you and that isn’t all. Ultimately as luck would have it the Republicans gained three SCOTUS seats in four years.

If you know all this stuff already, then why is it okay for Republicans to modify the Filibuster but not your own party, the Democrats? They are your party, aren’t they? It seems you are favoring the opposition party, Republicans over your own party.

For starters in today’s divided country and parties it is next to impossible to get 60 votes to overcome the Filibuster since no one party has had sixty senators since 1980 — 42 years.

Should you get your way, and many Democrats lose the right to vote or Republicans over-ride the vote which makes it impossible for Democrats to compete, it will be your fault and realistically since the Republicans control the elections why would they bother with the Filibuster at all anymore. The answer is they wouldn’t. They’d just deep six the Filibuster and who’s going to stop them? Thanks to you two, Democrats would have no weapons to fight them off anymore.

So, you see, instead of saving the filibuster you are hastening its demise.",Election
dailykos,Election,4718,dailykos,"Democrats are happy that they only lost a little this month. Democrats lost the House, and might gain 1 seat in the Senate. Democrats had some important wins in this election, there’s no doubt about it.

However, looking at the GOP as a fascist political party waging an aggressive and violent war against our democracy, one would think Democrats would mop the floor with these fascists.

Sure Oz lost in PA, but he did better than he should have. Walker in Georgia legit does not have a fully functioning brain for whatever reasons, and the preacher at MLK’s church — Warnock — has to go to a runoff to beat Walker.

Democrats don’t take it to the Republicans with any force. In every instance, Democrat leaders take a weak position.

Biden had the courage to say that some Republicans might be “semi-fascist.”

Pelosi took every opportunity to delay going after Trump. After we gave Dems the House in 2018. Pelosi refused to begin impeachment hearings for 8 months. She absolutely punted on the Mueller report — she didn’t care.

Pelosi spent 10 months asking the traitors if they wanted subpoena power to investigate their own January 6 crimes. That was critical time wasted. The committee might crap out a report before the GOP takes back the House in January and kills off the entire thing.

The GOP will waste no time using their power controlling the House by a slim majority. There will be many investigations, most likely targeting Trump’s greatest foe — the Department of Justice. I doubt Garland lasts through next summer as AG.

Rather than fighting fiercely for us and our democracy, Democratic leadership is happy to go along with all of it. They might pay lip service to ending the filibuster, but they know they have no intention of doing anything. They might pay lip service to passing voting rights, but they know the GOP will filibuster the bill, which they did.

The GOP hasn’t won the popular vote for the presidency since 1988, but how many times has anyone heard a Democratic leader speak with any seriousness about the electoral college. Is it really that hard to convince states controlled by Democrats to agree that their electoral votes will go to whoever wins their state’s popular vote — period.

We need new leadership now, and we need to force that change to happen.

I’m a precinct chair in the Democratic party. I got the role because no one else was doing it. As a precinct chair, we can influence state democratic parties. This is how evangelicals took over the GOP. We need to do the same. It will be easier than trying to create a new political party. Figure out how to become a precinct chair in your district. It really is easy, and you can do as much, or as little as you want in the role.",Election
dailykos,Election,4720,dailykos,"[Please participate in poll below to share how and if this premise could play out]

Isn’t it time that outgoing Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi extracts the appropriate pound of flesh from every House member who participated directly in the Jan. 6th attempted coup? They violated their oaths of office, voted against certifying the election using what each knew was a purely fabricated political excuse.

Some led tours of the Capitol. Some helped recruit or prepare fake electors. Some stood on the House floor and spread volatile lies they knew to be untrue with incitement as a goal. Even possible future Speaker McCarthy has blood on his hands in this.

These actions are all reason enough to be expelled from office. Let’s urge Speaker Pelosi to HOLD EXPULSION VOTES BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. And once expelled, they can never again be sworn in, because the 14th Amendment says they lose the right to serve in any public office again.

When the new Congress convenes on Jan. 3, those seats will remain empty. They can only be filled again once special elections in each state are held. Some may flip to Democrats as the revulsion of the GOP brand grows. But either way, there will be by default a Democratic Speaker until enough new Republicans are seated to establish a different plurality.

For each vote, ask Republicans to take the stand to defend their actions and bring evidence of why they shouldn’t be expelled. If they choose to stay silent, they are not fighting expulsion. If they do testify under oath, Contempt of Congress charges lie ahead if they cite The Big Lie, knowing that there was never any evidence supplied in any of the 60 cases the Trump legal team filed to block certification of election results in states. They can’t “double-down” as is customary these days among right-wing zealots backed into a corner because they will perjure themselves.

Of course, the Republican leadership and Trump will cry foul in the loudest possible way. But they will be in “boy who cried wolf” mode, in that they always do that. Expulsions will be based on clear evidence, not political posturing. This may be a dangerous precedent, but it does follow the guidelines that the Constitution put in place for a reason.

Now imagine if this process is started in December. Only enough expulsions have to be completed by the end of the year to keep the House under Democratic control come January. The new Speaker, whomever he or she is, can continue the process for months if needed until every #SeditionCaucus member is gone. Meanwhile, as the majority party, Democrats will still retain control of all House committees, and perhaps the January 6th Committee can reconvene using existing members to further its investigation into Trump’s parade of travesties. Not only that, but they may choose to expand their roll into investigating all House members soon to face expulsion themselves.

This process could see the end of the threat of #RepubloFascism pushing aside democracy through sinister and cynical means. If either Senators Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema see the writing on the wall and ditch the filibuster, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act could both be passed into law.

These laws would take away the chief weapons that Republicans use to tilt elections in their favor such as partisan gerrymandering and restrictions on mail-in and early voting that have racist roots. Also, being resubmitted in the new Congress, both of these laws could be rewritten to eliminate the newest iterations of GOP election meddling, such as yanking precincts to create huge lines for those precincts that remain in African American neighborhoods.

Also, all public office campaigns would be publicly not privately funded. Therefore the horrendous results of the Citizens United Supreme Court decision could be bypassed.

Of course without the filibuster, progressive legislation could flourish such as enshrining a woman’s rights to her own body and equal treatment of the LGBTQ community under the law, including of course marriage. In fact, every threat to our social safety nets, such as Social Security and Medicare, could be vanquished. In time monopoly capitalism itself could be addressed.

In short, with the filibuster gone we stand ready with all the tools necessary to expand the American dream to its full greatness. We can finally see the potential of the pursuit of happiness cited in the Constitution when taken beyond easing the lives of white land owners. With the addition of women, all people of color, and every other marginalized community, we can finally achieve America’s best incarnation.

This is all possible if Speaker Pelosi is effectively encouraged to take this bold yet justified step. Please share this post here and elsewhere.

No matter how rational we think we are, we often just want a glimpse at the future, to divine What Will Be, and sneak a peek at our horoscopes for good measure. It’s just being human, I suppose, while we otherwise scoff at those who plan their lives around such stuff.

So, I have no explicit prediction about the 2022 midterm elections. But yet, for some undefined reason, I can’t shake the feeling that the ghost of the 2016 election is lurking about. The polls and our Media Glitterati were very, very confident about the outcome; outliers were just dismissed. Until the dust settled, of course.

Which party will lose more seats in 2022? It could be one or the other, declare I. That’s the closest I’ll get to prophecy.

But that boldly said, something is not sitting right about this “red wave” narrative. Even if I divorce (as best I can) my own personal wishes about the outcome, there is too much external overconfidence bordering on arrogance to give me pause.

dailykos,Election,4669,dailykos,"Well, it’s football season, so we’ll go there metaphorically. Half time (the mid-terms) for the Biden Administration is nearly here. It’s time to look at the stats for team blue.

Now Regular Joe (as opposed to Broad Way Joe) has been at this game since 1970 when he was elected to the New Castle County Council. At age 29 he was elected to the United States Senate. One of the youngest ever elected to the most exclusive club on this planet. Served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a dozen years; then the Judiciary Committee from 1987 till 1995. He ran to quarter back the Executive Branch twice… in 1987 and again in 1995. Failed both times. Then in 2007 he chose to run with one Barack Obama. As his backup. He was at this moment the fourth senior sitting senator. He gave that up to switch leagues from the legislative branch to the executive branch: if you please. As the back up! There is an old saw that goes something like this, “There once were two brothers: one became a missionary who went to deepest darkest Africa and the other became Vice President and neither were heard from again!” Not so here!

They ran: they won. Twice. The bromance began then, still exists and is stronger today. For eight years Joe served as the backup. The bomb, their major score, was the passage of The Affordable Care Act, aka Obama Care. It passed the senate 60-39. Just enough for passage. Thank you, darlin’ Arlen Specter, (D? Pa.) Never had a single bullet gone so far! Oh yeah, they saved the auto industry too. No trick play that.

And Joe stepped off the field. The personal pain and grief of losing a son to brain cancer was consuming...debilitating. After a season off the field, he decided to run again for quarter back of the Executive Branch. After a slow start in the primaries, he won going away, as they say. The ‘W’ in the Presidential Election was most respectable and gratifying.

At the start of the first half of our current game Regular Joe quarter backed using the bipartisan play book. The fans howled. Team red doesn’t play by those rules they said. And they were right. But using a play book and knowing the rules of the game are two very different things. Joe knows the rule book front to back. He called the 50 plus one rule for budget plays in the senate for his American Rescue Plan and Kamala ran it in. (First woman backup QB...a woman of color to boot... more points for the blue team) The 1.9 trillion $ bill was signed on 3/11/21. Major score!

Infrastructure Week. That was a punch line during the previous four-year game. Joe’s Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Bill passed the senate 69/30. Guess the red team likes bridges that aren’t ready to fall down or already have and roads that don’t rattle your fillings. And the fans grumbled that yeah that one was bipartisan. So what!

The next major score was the Chip and Science Act. Ain’t talking potato chips here fans. And, stunningly, this was passed in the senate 64-33. A bipartisan vote. Not the wonder of the age...just a contender. Signed into law 8/9/22...I believe.

Now for the IRA. No, not your retirement plan fan. The Inflation Reduction Act is what I’m talking’bout. Joe again called the 50 plus rule in the senate. And again, Kamala ran it in. Passed 51/50. In a hundred-member body. Check the rule book. Csonka got nothin’ on Kamala. The best part of this play, besides the passage of the bill, is the fact that the red team's senate middle linebacker aka Senate Minority leader Mitch Mcconnell, got blind-sided on the play. The old turtle found himself sitttin’ on a fence post with his legs waving in the air and he knows exactly who put him there. Just the look on his face….

So, half time is approaching, and team blue has run up the score pretty good. Joe gets ready for the second half with an inspirational speech to his team and fans in front of the building in Philly where the founders of this game wrote down the rules, aka The Constitution of the United Staes of America. Some in the stands complained about the red background. If you think that was an unforced error, you don’t know Joe. Isn’t red a sign of danger? The two Marines were a nice touch too A reminder, they protect The President of the United States. And their standing post added a just right aggressive touch, ordered by the Commander in Chief.

Joe told us about the new play book he would use in the second half. The bipartisan playbook put aside for the moment. Using it he got what he could from team red (a lot). When he could get nothing more, he changed the play book and... Mitch meets fence post. Divide and conquer the red team. Why yes, there are good people on the red team. Maybe most of the team. Bipartisan votes prove that. But some members of the red team are semi! A danger to the greatest game ever invented. Their fans are upset. Good. Emotional and upset people make mistakes. Make bad calls.

I don’t know how the second half will play out but we gonna find out. Well Regular Joe isn’t the goat but he will make the hall of fame next to such greats as the FDR/ Truman team. They played for 20 years and changed the world. LBJ comes to mind, if only for his domestic game. You look at Joe and what do you see? Nearing 80 there ain’t much left physically. Just bone, muscle and sinew. But, after a lifetime of studying and learning and playing the greatest game ever, this is his sublime moment!",Election
dailykos,Election,4676,dailykos,"Los Angeles County Sheriff's department has had a long history of abuse, corruption, obfuscation, and jail terms. Voters in 2018 got a Spanish speaking, moderate Democrat who promised change and accountability, at least until elected.

Once Alex Villanueva became sheriff, things changed. Villanueva oversaw a department with continued abuse in the jails, brutalization of civilian population (a bicyclist was shot and killed over a traffic stop), favoritism in the ranks, tattooed gangs formed within the department, ignoring subpoenas from the oversight committee, and lying, lying, lying.

Then there were the monitary payouts, the latest being for his officers taking grotesque Kobe Bryant death photos and sharing at a bar, then the sheriff lied about his knowledge of the incident.

In the June primary, Villanueva, as incumbent sheriff won only 30% of the vote. Second place of the competitors went to Robert Luna, retired Long Beach police chief who got 25% of the vote. They will meet on the Nov 8th ballot. Currently polling has Luna in the lead, but 40% undecided. Villanueva continues to try to scare people with the standard Republican lies on crime.

So what does an embattled incumbent sheriff do? Lie, play games and attack their enemies.

On Wednesday morning, the LA sheriff served search warrants on Shiela Kuehl, LA County supervisor, her friend Patti Higgans, member of the Sheriff Civilian Oversight Commission, their offices, and the offices of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), alleging political corruption.

The MTA went to court immediately, as the sheriff had tried to get a warrant for the MTA earlier, and the judge told the sheriff's department that any records seized would have to be reviewed by a special Master. It seems the sheriff then went judge shopping to one who allegedly may have a conflict of interest.

But the corruption just doesn't stop. On Friday, the Los Angeles Times printed an investigative piece that there appears to be a correlation of processing of gun carry permits and donations to the Villanueva campaign. A concealed carry permit has been virtually impossible to obtain in populated areas of California until the recent SCOTUS mistake.

Also on Friday, the LA Times published an article summarizing Villanueva's lies, and suggested when compared with TFG, TFG looks like George Washington and the cherry tree. Perhaps a little hyperbole?

On November 8, Los Angeles County cannot make the mistake of reelecting Villanueva. The choice is clear, vote for Robert Luna. LA cannot have a sheriff who is TFG, Joe Arpaio and Viktor Orban rolled up in one.",Election
dailykos,Election,4723,dailykos,"Did you know that Kentucky State Democrats could not stop a man who backed Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine from getting the primary nod to run in the 6th Congressional District? I admit that I didn’t pay attention because I was busy looking at races outside of Kentucky. I have a cynical view of my fellow Kentuckians for a myriad of reasons, but I want to introduce you to Geoff Young the Democratic Party’s nominee to KY-6th in 2022. And what it says about this man who got the nomination should tell you how moribund the Kentucky State Democratic Party is.

Perennial political candidate Geoff Young is the Democratic nominee for Kentucky’s 6th Congressional district, but the state party and top elected official, Gov. Andy Beshear, say they won’t support him. He’ll face Republican incumbent Rep. Andy Barr during this year’s General Election in November. Young is a retired state engineer and has battled with the Kentucky Democratic Party for years, accusing the organization of rigging primary elections against him. He’s filed several lawsuits against the party and top Democratic figures, none of which advanced very far in the courts system. Recently, he made controversial statements supporting the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Young posted a conversation on his campaign website in which he says the Ukrainian Army is dominated by Nazis, repeating propaganda Russian President Vladimir Putin has used to justify the country’s invasion. He defended the statement during an interview on Thursday. “My motto from now until November is, unlike Andy Barr, I will never vote to send weapons to Nazis. That should be a very popular position in America,” Young said.

This guy has run for office for the LAST TEN YEARS, and he finally got “lucky” and beat out a high school teacher by 1,000 votes. Once upon a time, Democrats tried to find some candidates to flip the 6th District. Amy McGrath was the great white hope back in 2018.

But it appears that after Republican redistricting and removing a Democratic city from the 6th that Kentucky Democrats decided not to support anyone in the primary.

So we got a guy who thinks that there are NAZIS in Ukraine and vowed to cut off aid to the Ukrainians. And the state Democrats know who Young is because he has camped outside Democratic Headquarters in Frankfort and screamed at Governor Andy Beshear and his son, “one of the criminals has arrived.” And he’s also filed a number of frivolous lawsuits against the Democratic Party because he thinks they have denied him his chance to run for office.

The animosity between Young and the Democratic Party is so bad that Governor Beshear and the other Democrats said, “No WAY do we support this guy!” And that was just the beginning. From what I have seen of Beshear, he rarely makes anything personal. However, when Beshear said that Young needs help and this run wasn’t going to help him any, Young took this as Beshear saying he was “mentally ill.”

With such a winner, you can see why Republican Congressman Andy Barr was reelected. Again. And again.

As a reminder to those outside of Kentucky, Democrats only control the governorship and have one congressional district. And that’s it. Republicans control the legislature and all the other major statewide offices.

I bring this story to anyone who takes the time to read it to point out that many in Kentucky say that Democrats are doomed because Kentucky is a conservative state. Despite my cynicism, I think that is a cop out. Kentucky was dominated by Democrats, and it was only a a good day with the stars and planets in alignment that you had moderate Democrats in charge. The kind phrase for this type of political tilt was “center right” to describe Kentucky Democrats.

In other words, lots of conservative Democrats ran the state government and dominated the federal offices.

The problem is that Kentucky Democrats let the party organizations and GOTV efforts die. And the head of the Kentucky Democrats was just a guy who showed up to collect a paycheck and do nothing else. Once upon a millenia ago, being a precinct captain meant you might have gotten some pay, or it was a good way to start to work your way up in the party structure. Now, those offices are empty of people, at least when it comes to Kentucky Democrats.

So the moral of this story is that it really is the tale of 1) the good old boys who ran a political party apparatus into the ground and 2) proving Howard Dean correct in that to win you have to at least SHOW UP.",Election
dailykos,Immigration,4642,dailykos,"Donald Trump made a lot of promises to his horde of followers, the biggest one being that Mexico would pay for the wall he intended to build along the southern border. His promise to build the wall catapulted him to the presidency, and his supporters eagerly anticipated the contruction of the big “beautiful” border wall, bought and paid for by Mexico! But since Donald Trump is an unmitigated failure and charlatan, his dream never came to fruition, disillusioning some of his diehard fans and followers.

Joe Biden has been the president for nearly two years. He has used this time to overturn hundreds of the cruel and venal policies signed into existence by the disgraced ex-president. He has also proved himself adept at delivering on promises that Donald Trump was unable to fulfill. An appropriate example is the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which was signed into law near the end of 2021. The often repeated infrastructure week was brought into existence by Joe Biden and a democratic congress. The bill was a great accomplishment by Biden, and signified an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump, the abject failure of a man. I could imagine Donald Trump stewing in one of his palatial estates.

In regards to security at the southern border, President Joe Biden and Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the president of Mexico, coalesced around a plan for increased border security. And you know what? Mexico has committed to paying 1.5 billion dollars for border infrastructure, the type of commitment Donald Trump was unable to exact from the Mexican president. Has someone shared this information with Trump? I do hope so. Because once again, Biden was able to was able to do something that Trump couldn’t do. Because unlike Trump, who is all bluster, Biden is a man of action who delivers on policy.

dailykos,Immigration,4730,dailykos,"In her moving debut novel, Wandering Souls, Cecile Pin tells the story of a Vietnamese family desperate to leave their 1970s war torn country. The story opens with the family’s three older children becoming “boat people” in route to Hong Kong where they await the arrival of their parents and four younger siblings who don’t make it. The story follows the three survivors as their physical and emotional ordeal unfolds over decades. It’s a poignant portrait of what refugees and asylum seekers face, putting a much-needed human face on the experience of others.

But it is only one story. There are multitudes more. They are heartrending tales of traveling through deserts, facing thirst and hunger, suffering physical and sexual abuse, surviving family separation. And a growing number of people, young and old, strong and weak, all seeking safety, keep coming in waves in search of human rights, work, and dignity.

According to the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), “record numbers of migrants [from just Central America] risked their lives in 2022 to cross the treacherous, remote jungle region bridging Central and South America.” More than 151,000 migrants came to the U.S. in less than a year from countries around the world. Others died trying to get here.

It will only get worse given civil war, political instability, increasing violence, economic crises, and global warming. Currently CFR reports that about two million cases are backlogged in U.S. immigration courts. That number will grow while those already in the system wait years to have their cases heard.

Sadly, the legal and judicial systems make things harder for refugees and asylum seekers by establishing obstructive, unnecessary, bureaucratic barriers that would be challenging for anyone, especially for those who don’t speak English.

“The U.S. imposes innumerable walls on people seeking safety,” says Kate Paarlberg Kvam, executive director of the Community Asylum Seekers Project (CASP) in Brattleboro, Vermont. “Non-citizens in immigration court have no established right to counsel. The government can eject asylum seekers from the country, and they have no right to a lawyer. When people seek asylum here, they are blocked from obtaining work authorization for an arbitrary period of months, or longer. When they do get work, they are frequently exploited.”

CASP, a pioneering organization recognized for its work in supporting immigrants, offers a wide range of services to asylum seekers through a network of volunteers and community partners. It provides lawyers, assists in securing work permits, and helps people survive until they can work, all while advocating for better policy at state and federal levels. Paarlberg Kvam feels lucky to work alongside people seeking asylum. “Their resilience, their refusal to be beaten, and the hospitality and solidarity they show to one another is a window into a better way to live. Asylum seekers don’t need people like me to teach them how to build a new life – they just need us to remove the pointless barriers that are in their way.”

In her book A is for Asylum Seeker, Rachel Ida Bluff recounts some of what one volunteer witnessed at the southern U.S border. “I have mental images of that wet, chilly day: the teen couple who consider whether to get married as we shelter under the highway bridge, in the hope it would allow them to better keep track of each other; the two-year old in the big, donated white puffy coat who eventually takes a nap in her mother’s arms; the young woman who dials a friend on my cell phone as she walks toward the bus with barred windows that will take her across the border, frantically leaving message in Creole.”

Anyone of these innocent people could have experienced months, even years, in mostly for-profit detention camps or holding facilities without access to lawyers, advocates, or sponsors. They will have been held in cold, crowded cells, given poor food, dangerously inadequate health care, limited hand-me-down clothes and hygiene products, and little emotional support. Who among us could survive that intact?

Sadly, much of immigration policy in the U.S. is driven by economic motives, fear, false assumptions, and stereotyping, all of which add to the trauma of those who have braved escape from inhumane conditions and economic strife. Rightwing politicians have been quick to ascribe the stigma of criminality to people who have suffered in unimaginable ways, resulting in unspeakable acts of violence. That’s why we need to put a human face on immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, who contribute much to our country and communities, practically and culturally.

I am the progeny of asylum seekers. My grandparents and parents came to North America in the early 20th century to escape pogroms against Jews in Ukraine. Some came through Ellis Island, where they suffered indignities, but most were immigrants with family sponsors, so they didn’t experience what current asylum seekers do. Still, growing up, I witnessed the emotional and practical impact that experience had on them. It’s part of a legacy that shaped my life. But, outside of anti-Semitic experiences, I cannot imagine the toll taken on others who of necessity continue to seek shelter and welcome in another country, whatever the motivating forces.

We would be wise to remember that except for Native Americans, we are all immigrants in this country. Our ancestors are among the “wandering souls” that inhabited the place we call home. Can we offer kindness and compassion to those who follow us, at least by looking into their eyes and seeing the pain they reflect?",Immigration
dailykos,Immigration,4590,dailykos,"Vladimir Putin may be a lot of things but one thing that is entirely true is that he is reacting just as some pretty smart diplomats predicted more than 20 years ago.

To set the table for this piece, it’s important to remember a few things about Russia:

First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character. This attitude has been prevalent since the days of the tsars. It is good to remember that as ham-fisted as Russia’s actions at home and abroad can be, it is still the country which has given is incredible cultural contributions, from Tolstoy to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff to Kandinsky and Nijinsky. The list is endless. Yet, it has been—arguably—relatively isolated for centuries.

Second, Russia has been invaded twice in modern times—once by Napoleon and once by Hitler—with absolutely catastrophic consequences for the Russian people, not to mention the invaders.

Third, the soil of central and eastern Europe have absorbed more blood from war than any other part of that continent. Shifting borders from the 16th century onward, among European tribes, nations, and religions have been a regular occurrence in the part of the world.

George Kennan, once described as the smartest modern diplomat we’ve ever had, and the main architect of the 40-year Soviet containment policy during the Truman administration, knew something about Russia.

Kennan knew that every Russian leader understood that Russia’s “neurotic” view of the West was also fed by a series of autocrats who needed conflict as a justification for their rule, the most important of whom was Josef Stalin. As it relates to the present invasion of Ukraine, Kennan’s policy of containment, which was official policy of the Western nations from the 1950’s to the final collapse of the USSR in the 1990’s seems to have been manifestly successful.

In 1997 Kennan, at the age of 93, published and opinion piece in the New York Times advocating for admitting or extending an invitation to former Soviet clients to join NATO. NATO members were keen to bring the Baltic states, Poland and Romania as well as others into the alliance.

NATO had even floated the possibility of Russia itself joining NATO (which went nowhere fast!). Kennan pointed out that here was a newly minted “democratic” Russia, emerging from 70 years of totalitarianism, unsure of itself, it total disarray economically and militarily, its gutted army having just backed out of Afghanistan, its fleet devastated and tied up in port. And now comes NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of the WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit, sharing a border with Mother Russia. The former satellites, themselves afraid of being overrun by the Russian bear once again, quickly jumped on the NATO bus.

In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe and who, thanks for Boris Yeltsin, found himself holding the keys to the Russian kingdom, Over the last 20 years has snuffed out the light of liberty in exchange for the reestablishment of the kind of absolute order he can personally control. And he sees NATO on his front doorstep; and worse, the possibility of a Ukraine NATO member just a few hundred miles from Moscow. Finally, Putin now has his pretext for reacquiring the former client—now members of NATO— states. NATO, he tells his people, is bent on destroying Mother Russia.

Will he move further west? Hard to tell. What is certain, though, is that Putin has taken a huge bite of the apple with Ukraine. Whether he can swallow it is yet to be decided. The same fears now are the same fears of yesteryear among Russia and her leaders. Once again, Putin, ever fearful of western encroachment and more importantly fearing a threat to his rule, has thrown down the gauntlet.",Immigration
dailykos,Immigration,4674,dailykos,"The original interview I did with The Guardian Australia generated a lot of interest on here so I thought people might be keen to read what CBP have said about one of their staff asking me if I’d had recent abortion.

CBP told The Daily Beast they ask all travellers in their custody a series of health questions, including pregnancy-related questions for females being held in airport detention. CBP said the immigration officer asked me—the female traveller en route to Canada—if I ‘suffered a pregnancy loss’ (the officer didn’t say that).

Now, the agency is denying her claim and insisting the officer asked only if she had suffered a pregnancy loss—which it says is standard procedure for any woman being detained at a border crossing. “CBP denies any wrongdoing,” an agency spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “The officer acted with integrity, respect, professionalism and in accordance with U.S. laws and regulations.”

Now they’re telling the Daily Mail: 'We don't use the word abortion ever. We say termination of pregnancy’. They definitely didn’t ask about ‘termination of pregnancy’ either. The officer said abortion. ‘Have you had recently had/had a recent abortion?’

Jaime Ruiz, public affairs for the US Customs and Border Protection/US Department of Homeland Security sent DailyMail.com a lengthy statement that includes their policies and denied the claims made by Gourley. 'We don't use the word abortion ever. We say termination of pregnancy. You can go back to the policy act it never mentions the word abortion,' Ruiz said. He continued, saying, 'the story has been taken out of context' and that the incident had 'nothing to do with politics or anything. Nothing to do with abortion today. It is totally unrelated. The abortion word was never used.'

Isn’t an abortion the same as ‘termination of pregnancy’? What do you guys think?

And has it been taken out of context? I didn’t say there was a political motive behind it—I just thought it was odd they asked me these questions given I was being held on suspicion of working illegally in the USA (despite being on my way to Canada when this all happened).",Immigration
dailykos,Immigration,4583,dailykos,"I read the Colorado Springs Independent every week — free newspaper with an investigative reporting group that has oversized skills set (llok up the national journalism awards for their staff — impressive). This week they had a really important article here titled:

Charis College is a compound created by Andrew Wommack Ministries — some of you may heard of this one. It is a college that:

here is an emphasis at the college in training students to become political leaders, and the college teaches a version of Young Earth creationism, which is based on a literal interpretation of Genesis, and holds that Earth and all life on it were created in their current forms by the God of Abraham somewhere around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.

This has caused a little concern since Wommack has publicly:

said last April “as many people as we have in this school here, we ought to take over Woodland Park,” it did more than raise a few eyebrows — particularly when he elaborated, saying “this county ought to be totally dominated by believers,” and, “We have enough people here in this school we could elect anybody we want.”

The article is a through look at the confluence of religion and politics in small town America where a national ministry can, in essence, coopt a town.

Woodland Park — the home of Charis — is about 19 miles downtown to downtown — probably closer to 10 miles border to border. El Paso County — home to both Colorado Springs and Woodland Park — is one of the epicenters of evangelical business, broadcasting, and politics.

dailykos,Police,4627,dailykos,"Per the LA times, Rick Caruso was a Republican until he switched to Democrat for the 2022 Mayoral race. This guy’’s net worth is . IMO he’s purchasing the mayoral position, if he can. He’s being promoted as “Common Sense Liberal” in the Wall Street Journal. He’s running against Rep. Karen Bass, the progressive former chairman of the Black Caucus (IMO the best candidate by far.).

He’s saying the right things. But I don’t believe his bull shit. He’s a Republican running as a Democrat and when in office will do what Republicans want him to do. But…..he’s running neck and neck with Karen.

Mr. Caruso wants to add 1,500 police officers and move tens of thousands of homeless into temporary housing while cutting red tape that makes building homes expensive. He says he would insist that the city attorney prosecute misdemeanors that now go unpunished. Mr. Caruso’s sensible ideas have drawn an eclectic fan base, including the city’s police union, celebrities such Snoop Dogg and Kim Kardashian, Korean-American business leaders and an 88-year-old community activist known as Sweet Alice Harris, who founded a charity to help youth in southeast Los Angeles.

Here’s a little of the progressive stance by Karen Bass.

Ms. Bass wants to keep the police budget flat while hiring 250 civilian employees to handle administrative tasks that officers sometimes have to do. Yet she also wants to pile more administrative burdens onto police, including reporting on stops and searches and “implicit bias” training.

How many other Democrats are really Republicans bull shitting the public to get into office? I believe there is a lot of this going on behind the scenes and if we all don’t pay attention and dive into who really is running for office, we might get a Manchin or Sinema AGAIN and we can’t afford it.

75% of voters in L.A. didn’t VOTE. How to stir them up — all across the country? I’m tired, I get it.

dailykos,Police,4579,dailykos,"Right after the January 6th episode I told my friends I thought that Trump had been planning on instituting martial law based on his assumption that, in response to his frequent calls for a January 6th demonstration, a horde of left-wing counter protesters would appear made up of antifa, BLM people, and others and when the inevitable battle between this group and the MAGA crowd ensued, Trump would use the Insurrection Act to call martial law and stop everything. I further believed, when we learned about how the Flynns and Trump’s DOD appointments made sure the National Guard could not be on site, that this absence was to ensure chaos among the rioters, further justifying the Insurrection Act. We can now presume that this action, along with the pressure on Pence to act, and the forgery of several false slates of electors, was all designed to throw the election into the House of Representatives whereby the one state/one vote rule would place Trump back in the Oval Office.

However, antifa and BLM and the lefties didn’t come to the party, and instead of a battle royale in Washington’s streets the MAGA mob invaded the Capitol itself. There were surely a few among that mob with devious intent, the Oath Keepers, others, in military gear, working with plans, hoping to further delay the vote certification, but I think they were a (dangerous) minority among a mob of Trump supporters who believed the election was stolen and who simply followed everyone else into the building once breached. This whole effort might have been a second element of a broad plan to stop the certification in case Pence failed to do as Trump ordered, and when it became clear he (Pence) would not, then this contingency was activated.

I think, though, the overall idea was that this MAGA crowd, whipped up and angry, was supposed to then encounter an equally large anti-Trump crowd such that Trump could declare martial law. Recent revelations of draft Executive orders and talking points, a “healing” speech drafted in mid December, weeks before the riots, but speaking of riots, makes clear (at least to me) they were banking on street violence and planning to use that violence to declare martial law, stop the certification, and throw the election into the House.

It never occurred to them antifa and BLM and others would not show up. It sure seems like many close to Trump were in on this, and right after the 6th people were using lots of talking points (blaming antifa) in hopes they might still pull this off. It has only been in recent weeks as details have emerged about false electors and documents released to the Jan 6th committee after Trump lost in the Supreme court the other day that the full possible scale of this thing has become clear.",Police
dailykos,Police,4710,dailykos,"Elections often hinge on which candidates peak at the right time. Democrats had a nice surge in August following some legislative wins for Biden and the Democrats. That was long ago in the election cycle world.

One issue that never faded, although Republicans and pundits seem to think it did, is abortion rights. If Republicans have convinced enough people that inflation and crime are the Democrats’s fault then it could be a long day tomorrow for Democrats. It could also be that a number of voters are inclined to remember that economic events happen no matter which party is in power. I will assume that not everyone who has it as a priority going in to Election Day is ignorant of this. Both crime and not having enough money to live are reliable drivers for voters and Republicans know how to squeeze those issues no doubt. They have been pounding away on these two issues for many months in battleground states, yet the limbic brain can only take so much abuse before that level of fear messaging and negativity can begin to have diminished returns.

So now it comes back to who has more issues that the widest swath of voters care about. The Democrats have two that are polling high, a women’s right to choose and losing this thing we call Democracy. Those have never been on any ballot agenda before in any election which is why I think the conventual wisdom of the pundits who look to history and the poll aggregates thinking they can determine what happens on Tuesday is a flawed metric to use. A recent NBC poll showed a spike in Democratic voter’s enthusiasm. As I mentioned in an earlier piece, what happened to Paul Pelosi had repercussions immediately and I believe they have survived the rotating news cycles. It seems to me that a Republican surge has fizzled and it started in the days following that attack. This is not to say that it’s enough to change the trajectory of Republicans flipping the house. I do think anything less than a fifteen seat exchange in that chamber is a small victory for Democrats. This means that in 2024 the task of getting them back becomes easier.

The last aggregate of polls and some that showed up this weekend showed a return to some of the margins that should be good news for Democrats. By good, I mean avoiding a disaster of losing both chambers of Congress. Also some Governor races have moved beyond the margin for error. I am not just looking at the polls. I feel the zeitgeist too. This includes looking at the faces and body language of operatives in the Democratic Party. They seem energized compared to two weeks ago when glum was the prevailing mood coming from the MSNBC talent lineup and their guests. They know something it seems. So I feel comfortable in my prediction that the Senate will stay in the Democrat’s hands and if Nevada holds they will gain a seat in Pennsylvania. North Carolina could be the surprise pick up.

It will be a stressful day because the mail in ballots in Pennsylvania won’t be counted for days just like in 2020. Arizona and Georgia have put in new voter laws which may slow down the process of counting in those states. Republicans are filling lawsuits in all the battleground states that can also serve to gum up the works with challenges. It won’t be pretty but democracy, though wounded, will survive this particular election’s onslaught from those who think voting is a bad way to find leaders.

dailykos,Police,4629,dailykos,"Kos readers suspected that the authorities who worked at the Uvalde school shooting site were racist, but it seems the opposite happened. I suspect one of the reasons Irish-descended DPS Director Steven McCraw submitted to CISD Chief Pete Arredondo’s command was to avoid the appearance of racism. Consider that this pale Irish-American cop was facing a minority commander, pursuing a minority offender, at a predominantly minority school in a mostly Hispanic/Latino town. If McCraw started pushing back at Arredondo who was a prominent resident and elected politician at Uvalde, McCraw might be viewed as a racist, so he did whatever Arredondo told him which was the disastrous decision to prioritize evacuating Robb Elementary School over rescuing kids trapped in rooms 111 and 112 with mass murderer Salvador Ramos.

Director of Texas Department of Pubic Safety Steven McCraw oversees the State Trooper S.W.A.T. Team that enforces law at Mass Attacks in Public Places. “McCraw told Senator Roland Gutierrez that they had, “enough protection and manpower to break down the door.” The New York Times reported that at 12:15 pm “the BORTAC team, which would go on to enter the room and kill Ramos, had arrived in Uvalde and were in the hallway of Robb Elementary. They were joined by over a dozen other police. McCraw said at this time the BORTAC team had three ballistic shields, capable of stopping bullets fired from the weapons possessed by Ramos.” Yet, they had to wait half an hour before Arredondo gave them permission to kill the shooter.

State Senator Roland Gutierrez said that McGraw regretted “standing down.” So, why did McCraw back down and let Arredondo win?Imagine what would have happened if he started pushing and shoving Arredondo, barking commands at Arredondo’s all Hispanic/Latino team? Assuming he quickly dispatched Ramos, he would still be viewed as an arrogant, racist cop invading Arredondo’s territory, taking over command that rightly belonged to Arredondo as Chief of school police.

Already, DPS is in trouble because they didn’t provide information to Uvalde residents in Spanish. Texas is very mixed-race and then there's the immigration issue at the border, and there’s also the Defund the Police and Black Lives Matter campaigns. You don’t get to be Director of the Department of Public Safety without knowing politics and being-or at least appearing to-be respectful of minorities. Apparently, Arredondo was not going down without a fight.

He showed he was inflexible and unwilling to listen when a local officer suggested Arredondo go out to get body armor. Arrendondo responded angrily, “F*** y**. I’m not leaving this hallway.” If this is how he treats a local cop, think of what he would say to an outsider such as McCraw telling him what to do.

I believe things would have gotten very ugly if McCraw fought Arredondo. Probably, McCraw decided that clashing with Arredondo on his home turf was not the politic thing to do. Yet, I assume McCraw believed he was right. I think that’s why McCraw keeps criticizing Arredondo’s stall tactics.

For example, he said, ""there were children in that classroom that were at risk, and it was, in fact, an active shooter situation and not a barricaded subject. It was the wrong decision. Period. There's no excuse for that...There should have been an entry...We don’t care what agency you're from. You don't have to have a leader on the scene...Every officer lines up, stacks up, goes and finds where those rounds are being fired at and keeps shooting until the suspect is dead.""

Too little, too late. This terrifying episode is a lesson to all of us to stand firm when our values are challenged, especially when it’s a life or death situation. The most important thing was to save those kids. I’ve taken a lot of flak for being true to myself when everyone else was against me, but I never regretted it.",Police
dailykos,Police,4625,dailykos,"At her school, they practice active shooter drills every year, but at the start of this school year, her school was testing a new alarm system. Without any prior warning, her computer screen turned red, began alerting her to an active shooter in the building, and instructed her to seek shelter. She eventually was told that it was just a technological error and she was never supposed to have received the alert, but the situation made her realize the heightened risks at play.

“I was pregnant and I was thinking to myself how before, I had thought that I would put myself between a shooter and my students, but now that I have a child that I’m carrying at this moment, well what choice would I make?” she said. “That was an awful thing to have to think about and luckily, I didn’t have to. It was a drill, but it just seems like there’s a bigger risk.”

For Megan, a college senior in San Antonio who wants to go into teaching after she graduates, the situation has directly impacted her desire to pursue a teaching career, and she has recently been considering teaching online instead of in person.

“It’s scary to think of where we are as a society and where we are in America,” Megan said. “It’s really sad. It definitely alters what I may want to do in the future.”

Megan’s sister, who is a high school teacher in a small town outside of Corpus Christi, Texas, was just in a lockdown situation on Thursday, May 26, while police were looking for a suspect in the neighborhood.

“It’s scary to think that something like [Uvalde] could happen to her any day anytime,” Megan said. “My sister is my best friend. If something were to happen to her, I don’t know what I would do.”

Megan said the solution is not arming teachers, but instead implementing stricter gun laws, with mental health and background checks for people purchasing weapons. She hopes that locals will vote for politicians who support gun control and reform in the fall. All 13 Texas Democratic state senators wrote a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott last week urging him to raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21, and implement universal background checks for all firearm sales. But they are unlikely to gain traction in the Republican-controlled legislature.

“There’s no reason civilians need those weapons at all whatsoever,” Megan said. “I just think that’s ridiculous that people have access to weapons that can cause so much pain.”

The sixth-grade math teacher hopes that after taking a year off, she will return to teaching and that stricter gun laws will be passed to make her feel more comfortable in the classroom.

“I think assault rifles should be banned,” she said. “I don’t think it falls into the category of the ‘right to bear arms’ that our Founding Fathers intended. I wish no one had guns. I live in Texas, so I know that I’m in the minority here, but I don’t think assault rifles are necessary.”

Nora, an educator at an after-school arts enrichment and social justice program in Austin, said they learned about the shooting after students’ parents sent them text messages saying, “Thank you for keeping our babies safe.” The next morning, Nora discussed with their colleagues the best way to broach the topic with students, if it came up.

“There’s so much loss and grief in this country, mass shootings and COVID deaths, and just the abandonment of everyday people that we are seeing in so many places,” Nora said. “I was angry that I might have lie to my students and say that you’re safe here. That there’s no possibility that something bad could happen to you. It’s something that I deeply want to be true, but it isn’t.”

Teachers, who are already underpaid and under-supported, are many times asked to wear multiple hats for their students: educator, counselor, and caregiver. Now, many teachers feel they are being asked to stand on the front lines of mass shootings and protect their students in the absence of law enforcement.

“We ask a lot of our educators already, and then when you’re confronted with these really big structural realities and violence, there’s a limit to what we can do as individuals,” Nora said. “We need to act collectively to create safety for our students and for our colleagues and for our communities at large.”

While conservative lawmakers would like to arm teachers and increase police presence at schools, heightened school resource officer presence has also been linked to the school-to-prison pipeline.

“The police don’t actually create safety for us and when police are in the schools, it’s not to keep students safe,” Nora said. “It’s to arrest them and accelerate the school-to-prison pipeline and get them expelled or assault them.”

The solution, Nora posits, cannot be limited to gun control, because that would miss the larger cause of violence. They suggest investing in teachers, schools, and solutions that will prioritize community safety while confronting the root cause of the shootings—which for many has been misogyny and hatred toward women.

“We need to invest in our teachers, in housing, mental health, things that actually build life and create life,” Nora said. “I believe that whatever social cause or whatever fight that you’re invested in, if you are advocating for that, and it’s about creating safety, creating joy in your community, that is something that’s going to benefit teachers.”

More snow and ice coming, and lindsey graham pipped a squeak and the sskkkrumpgop bus just bounced the diameter of a wanker quicker than a RINO can backpedal.

Still, the chance that some charging authority charges sskkkrump and he needs arresting is a non-zero variable needing political and multi-discipline analysis, because the possibilities of serious or catastrophic events related to a future indictment, apprehension, transportation, and incarceration of tfg are many. I believe that planning for some possible outcomes is being done now. If not, it should be initiated immediately, including feasibility analysis of options if he decides to resist arrest and publicly calls for assistance at his Florida residence, or an alternate location he flees to. Would he voluntarily surrender then ratchet his calls for protests up? Maybe, but the government would be existentially negligent letting him out awaiting trial to call for mob violence probably. Hard to imagine that. But some things must be imagined, and gamed, and readied.

I am not sure how best to apprehend tfg by charging authorities. tfg presents a situation unique to American history, of critical monumental importance, yet fraught with immense national security danger prior, during, and after, for a likely extended but unknown time. I have written what I would like, and given my opinion that a cuffed perp walk next to FBI Special Agents and Federal Marshals would fit his crimes against the country. But, that is one possibility, perhaps a less than probable one. Still, IMO, above zero percent. Other possibilities are that he surrenders for a deal, shoots it out in Florida, summons a mob, etc. etc..

And after this unknown, what next with tfg? How can he be moved, and to where, exactly? Historical precedent and common sense might indicate incarceration aboard ships of the United States Navy would be possible, and in this case, it could offer a solution to a problem of locational security in an active threat environment, which seems a safe bet it will be, somehow.

If anyone has any thoughts about this, putting them out there would be interesting. I find it all very concerning, especially after this past weekend. One thing we know: communication to Americans by the apprehending authorities will be critical in every way. I have not done any research about other nations. Our current situation is unique to our history, and could actually find it altered depending on the outcomes of how all this is initiated and carried out if, and when, tfg needs to be apprehended.",Police

Current views are that the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin is one of a handful more likely to flip. Dynamic Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes is poised to send Ron “Conspiracies R Us” Johnson into retirement. A growing number of polls are showing Barnes with the edge, though the polls do still swing from one to the other.

Even CNN, which seems to enjoy tilting to the right these days, moved Wisconsin up two spots on its list of flippable U.S. Senate seats. Barnes’ success must be getting to the GOP. The NRSC is going all out to defeat Barnes, saying that his numbers will look different once they're done with their attacks.

But Barnes has hit back. He called the GOP scare-tactic ad that claims he supports defunding police with his own ad, calling it for what it is – a lie. “I'll make sure our police have the resources and training they need to keep our community safe and that our communities have the resources to stop crime. Before it happens, I'll bring back manufacturing and I'll pass the middle-class tax cut. And if that's too scary for Washington, then so be it.”

The excitement over picking up a Senate seat is prompting Together We Elect and the Daily Kos to sponsor a special Zoom event focusing on the races in Wisconsin. The Thursday, Sept. 15 event – open to all – will feature Ben Wikler, chair of the WisDems.

Wikler has been a frequent guest on the popular political podcast “Pod Save America” and is the go-to guy that media outlets turn to for insightful comments. Here’s what Politico wrote about Wikler:

“Since taking over as chair in 2019, he’s raised nearly $100 million, believed to be a fundraising record for a Democratic state party, and helped President Joe Biden win the tipping point state of the 2020 election, which helped Democrats rebuild their Midwestern ‘blue wall.’ Now, Wikler’s machine is facing its biggest test, one that will ripple into 2024.”

Wisconsin’s Congressional District 3 is also a race to watch. The retiring U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D, leaves open one of the country’s most competitive swing seats. WI State Senator Brad Pfaff, the former Wisconsin secretary-designee of agriculture, trade, and consumer protection, won the state's Democratic primary. He will face Republican Derrick Van Orden, whose campaign website continues to rant about schools being closed in the pandemic. But Van Orden narrowly lost to Kind in 2020, which has the GOP itching for a flip. And the district is rated R+4.

Wisconsin is a tough battleground. The two most recent presidential elections were decided by less than 1 percentage point. Biden defeated Trump by 0.7 points, and Trump defeated Clinton by 0.7 points.

dailykos,Police,4648,dailykos,"A few days before writing this commentary my husband went into town on a quick errand. When he didn’t return for a longer time than expected, my first thought when I began to worry was this: Could there have been an act of gun violence?

While waiting nervously for him to come home I learned that two days earlier an 18-year-old part-time junior police officer armed with a gun and with inadequate training had fired his weapon next to a school which fortunately was closed, and into a house where a bullet landed in a bedroom wall. Luckily, no one was injured.

What might easily have been a tragedy in my small, sleepy, rural town was deeply disturbing. It was also unimaginable, which is what we all think when our sense of immunity in the face of growing gun violence kicks in.

In a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, I wrote, “How is it possible that an 18--old person not long out of high school is permitted to serve on a police force, part-time, with a firearm, with limited if any training when research reveals that it isn’t until the age of at least 24 that the human brain is sufficiently mature to have developed impulse control and sound decision-making? Why is a junior, part-time cop in a small Vermont town allowed to carry a gun, especially without adequate training?”

Why, for that matter, is anyone allowed to readily purchase or gain access to guns – and in some states to open carry them, especially long, lethal guns designed for military use specifically to kill someone?

It is notable that numerous research studies published in recent years have addressed the issue of brain development and its relation to impulsivity and poor decision-making in adolescents. The studies are highly relevant to the issue of young people, including junior cops, who are males between 20 and 30, having access to guns. They show that “poor cognitive control and the tendency toward impulsive behavior influence the ability to make reasonable choices in daily-life situations during adolescence. In fact, many risky behaviors … are closely related to impulsivity in adolescence ….”

Put colloquially, “Neuroscientists are confirming what car rental places already figured out — the brain doesn't fully mature until age 25. Up until this age …the part of the brain that helps curb impulsive behavior is not yet fully developed. Some scientists say this could illuminate a potential factor behind a recent spate of acts of mass violence.”

The many questions flooding my mind and the mind of so many others in the aftermath of the Uvalde massacre are questions that have loomed ever larger since the slaughter in Newtown, let alone all the other school killings and fatal shootings in malls, movies, markets, clubs, churches, and other venues. They are questions that contribute nonstop to rage, grief, sadness and fear, all of which have grown exponentially until these feelings begin to inhabit our bodies in alarmingly somatic ways that illustrate the mind-body connection many of us now experience.

Some questions regarding gun violence are rhetorical, while others are frustrating beyond measure. Why, for example, after Newtown, have legislators on one side of the Congressional aisle – the side that wants to protect fetuses but continually prioritizes guns over babies or child welfare, still be able to remain in office? Why expect more guns to resolve the epidemic of mass shootings, or think that teachers with guns are the solution, if teachers would take up arms when trained cops are afraid to use them in the face of military weaponry that rips bodies apart in seconds? Why are we the only country in the developed world with this growing, egregious, tragic problem even though other countries have mentally ill citizens too?

Those are big questions for all of us to ponder, but like other moms, wives, family members, friends, and others, my personal questions haunt me to the point of neurosis because of the horror of continuing gun violence: Why haven’t the kids texted or called back? When will they phone to say they’ve arrived home safely? Is it safe for me to enter this bank or that restaurant, the grocery store, a performance venue? Should I walk here? How can I not be in the wrong place at the wrong time? Would I survive unspeakable loss?

In searching for a relevant end to this rumination I read copious anecdotal and empirical works about situational anxiety and depression, written or spoken by notable as well as lay people, before guns and violence became so much a part of our lives. They all sounded like tired cliches, superficial sound bites in this time. Now the urgency of what I read about anxiety and depression related to gun violence is markedly different. It is a collective, clarion call pleading for an end to what has become our country’s new, hideous, destructive normal.

I am reminded of something Martin Luther King, Jr. once said in a different context: “If you can’t fly, run. If you can’t run, walk. If you can’t walk, crawl, but by all means, keep moving.” If that’s the most a governing body can offer its citizens, what does it say about who we have become, and where we are headed?

“In my opinion it is to sway Asian American voters to more conservative, but also law and order candidates,” said Timmy Lu, executive director for AAPIs for Civic Empowerment Education Fund.

Wei Chen, an organizer in the Chinese American community who co-founded Pensylvannia’s Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance (or API PA), also noted that mailers from America First Legal were falsely claiming that the Biden administration discriminates against Asian Americans.

“Asian Americans, like many other communities of color and immigrant and refugee communities have had to fight through many barriers to vote — especially misinformation,” Chen said in an interview with The Intercept on Friday. “The ads are new; the tricks are not.”

The mailers are not new to the community and allegedly first appeared when crimes increased against the Asian community and were tied to then-President Trump referring to the novel coronavirus as “the Chinese virus” and “the kung flu.” In order to take the focus away from Trump’s language, the ads blamed Joe Biden for the rise in crimes, and used misleading headlines and text from right-wing news outlets to create a false narrative.

“This kind of ad, the political rhetoric has a real-world impact and our Chinese community and Asian community have to deal with the consequences of racist fear-mongering that Trump and the Republicans and Fox News are putting out,” Chen said. “Exploiting the pain Republicans have caused our community by blaming Chinese people for Covid and stirring up violence, it’s such a loser’s move. It’s a miscalculation to think that Asian Americans won’t see through it,” he added.

Other APPI advocates including Helen Gym, a Philadelphia City Council member, told The Intercept that “these horrendous, race-baiting mailers,” are a part of several efforts to suppress the Asian American vote. “I think anything that does the race-baiting and the fear-mongering — ‘You’re not welcome, you don’t count’ — is always an attempt to dissuade, suppress, breed cynicism and fear,” she said.

She added that direct contact with voters from the community is how advocates are working to stop the spread of disinformation.

With the midterm elections approaching this week, several Asian Americans have also shared how platforms trusted by the community, including WeChat and Whats App, have also been used to spread misinformation.

These reports were supported by a study done at the University of Texas, GovTech reported. ""We know that diaspora communities are a prime target for bad actors,"" said media engagement researcher Katlyn Glover. Glover noted that those who spread misinformation often target immigrant communities because they may not be familiar with how certain laws or protocols work. A common piece of misinformation being spread about tomorrow’s elections is that Election Day is on Wednesday, not Tuesday; as a result, those who may not be familiar with American election patterns could be misled.

Another example of misinformation targeting the Asian community GovTech mentioned is through groups that claim to be empowering. In 2016, a pro-Trump group called ""The Chinese Voice of America"" gained more than 32,000 followers in just a few months because many believed it was supporting the Asian voice or vote.

Similarly, groups that were created in the guise of supporting victims of hate crimes garnered followers only to spread misinformation about who was attacking Asian Americans. These right-wing-sponsored and made groups, which were popular during the Black Lives Matter protests, claimed AAPI community members were being attacked by Black and brown folks in order to create a divide and pin communities of color against each other.

RELATED STORY: Extremists are targeting AAPI communities with disinformation to pit them against other minorities

According to Daily Kos, anonymously run social media accounts, vloggers, and alternative news sites disseminated “powerful shock effect imagery” in the form of CCTV footage, graphic “photographs of bloodied Asian bodies,” and fabricated news stories to fearmonger against the Asian American community and not only drive a wedge between it and other communities of color but encourage AAPI folks to vote red.

""We've noticed that information that targets specific cultural values or specific concerns of communities is particularly powerful,"" Glover said. ""These groups that were created to be nonpolitical turned political when misleading information was shared and triggered people's concerns.""

dailykos,Police,4612,dailykos,"There are some basic qualifications for sitting on the Supreme Count of the United States (SCOTUS). These include:
• Not Lying or Committing Perjury in Confirmation Hearings:

Objectively speaking: Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett, have failed to show they are qualified to sit on the Court. As such, they NO LONGER meet the standards require to serve.

Article. III. SECTION. 1. States: “The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, … .”

The current make-up of the Court is:

The Constitution does not define what “Good Behaviour” is, but certainly; it includes a respect for the institution of the Court itself. The “leaked” Alito Draft opinion (Alito Draft) in the Dobbs v. Jackson case; reveals a fundamental disrespect for the Court and its precedents. Further, the opinion itself presents a FAILURE of even the most rudimentary basis of intellectual honesty. It displays an open contempt for the intelligence of the American people, by asserting that somehow, the Roe Court simply did not know what they were doing; and that this Court somehow has a better understanding of the law than any in the past. It defies all intellectual reasoning to say that Roe can be excised from the pantheon of judicial history, but that doing so will not undermine all other decisions. It is the ONLY TIME in the history of America, that the Court has proposed to “REMOVE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT” (as opposed to recognizing a previously undefine right, or expanding the understanding of rights to a new social circumstance). IT IS AKIN TO WHAT THE NAZI’S DID IN GERMANY IN DECLARING CERTAIN GROUPS ‘UNDESIRABLE’. The fundamental Constitutional right to access medical services to terminate a pregnancy HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR FIFTY YEARS. By July 1, 2022, that right will CEASE TO EXIST; as will every right that has been described under the “privacy” and Roe precedent.

Many times in our country’s history, the Court has been called upon to apply the fundamental nature of our democracy and freedom in terms more broadly construed than the existing precedent recognized. Many times, they refused (eg. Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856)). When they have, history has UNIVERSALLY panned the decisions as unprincipled and erroneously decided.

This case is different. Never has the Court acted to ELIMINATE an existing recognized Constitutional right, NEVER.

This is exactly what this Court is about to do; ELIMINATE a long-standing, recognized federal constitutional right. Further, their motivation for doing so is simply that THEY NOW HAVE A COURT WITH FIVE MEMBERS WILLING TO IGNOR THEIR OATHS AND DUTIES, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT ONLY HAS BASIS WITHIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL DOGMA. Nothing more. That is TYRANNY AT ITS WORST. More so, in that a vast majority of the public DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POSTION, DECISION, OR DOGMA.

We need to start calling this for what it REALLY IS: a JUDICIAL COUP; acting in operation to OVERTHROW the elected government, by judicial fiat. Upon this precedence, these five member could decide to declare the Pope the new president of the United States (and have in essence done just exactly that).

In addition, these justices have done exactly what they asserted (under oath) that they would not do: ignore the doctrine of Stare Decisis and overturn Roe.

I assert, that the Congress can and must, declare that these Justice NO LONGER SERVE UNDER THE TERMS OF “GOOD BEHAVIOUR”; and remove them from their positions.

The Constitution of the United States presents that the President must be Impeached (by The House of Representatives) and Convicted (by the Senate) to be removed from office (upon the qualifying offenses). It further presents that the individual body of the Congress, shall have the authority to determine the qualifications of its member to serve or continue serving. This process DOES NOT REQUIRE IMPEACHMENT (under the clear text of the constitution and its construction; “impeachment” is reserved for removal of the President, Vice-President, and the EXECUTIUVE BRANCH “OFFICERS”, as a necessity for removal from office. It is presented within the context of Article I (Legislative branch) and Article II (Executive branch): BUT IT IS NOT REPEATED under Article III (in regards to the Judicial branch). Thus, removal from office of a judicial branch member, requires only the CAUSE OF ACTION (violation of the “Good Behaviour” provision) and a majority vote of the Congress. As the Constitution provides the President the authority to nominate judges. This would suggest that any action to declare that a Judicial Officer is no longer qualified to hold a judicial position, because they are no longer compliant with the requirement of “Good Behaviour”, would likewise require the President to declare such to the Congress (stating the case against the Judicial Officer), in a Writ of Removal.

It is thus, that President Biden MUST IMMEDIATELTY DECLARE THESE FIVE JUSTICES NO LONGER FIT FOR OFFICE, AND REQUEST THAT CONGRESS VOTE TO REMOVE THEM DUE TO “BAD BEHAVIOUR”.",Police
dailykos,Police,4639,dailykos,"Former West Virginia legislator and Jan 6th insurrectionist Derrick Evans told CBS News he will be running for federal office in 2024. And Evans hinted that he will probably run to take on our favorite DINO Joe Manchin. I highlight this bit of news because 1) this guy has pled guilty and is going to prison for three months and 2) Evans has been elected to office before in WV and plans to be another insurrectionist trying for higher elected office.

If I am not mistaken, PA has an insurrectionist candidate running for governor along with another insurrectionist doing the same in MI.

Anyway, here are some of what you might need to know about Evans:

Evans, the highest-ranking government official to charged so far in a Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol breach criminal case, resigned his seat in the state legislature shortly after his arrest in January 2021. But he said his post-prison plans include a possible run for Congress — when Sen. Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, could be seeking reelection. He believes his arrest might actually galvanize political support in a state that overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in the 2020 election… He pleaded guilty to a count of civil disorder in March and was sentenced in June to three months in prison. He said he expects to be ordered to report to prison in the coming days, and is hoping to be incarcerated close to his home along the West Virginia-Kentucky border. Evans acknowledged wearing a helmet and live streaming his movements at the Capitol on Jan. 6. And he says many of his former constituents and his community in Prichard, W.Va., have had few, if any criticisms, of his actions at the Capitol… The Justice Department sought prison time for Evans, arguing he was part of a crowd that pushed against the police line during the riot. ""Evans also made clear his enthusiasm for what was happening — he cheered each advancement of 'patriots' against police on all sides of the Capitol,"" prosecutors said in a court filing. ""He urged rioters around him to 'take' the Capitol and he told them that the certification of the electoral college vote was paused 'because of protestors' and that 'patriots' made it onto the Senate floor. Evans whooped and hollered throughout his livestream, telling his followers, 'Guys, oh my gosh, I can't even explain what is happening right now, how amazing this is to see in person. I am in awe. The revolution has started. The revolution has started!'""

Now, Evans regrets and said it was stupid of him to go into the Capitol Building. But he has no regrets about being at the Jan 6th insurrection outside of the Capitol Building. According to Evans, it’s OK to be a bystander at an insurrection and cheer the other violent bastards on, but it’s bad if you actually participate in the violence.

We have heard this story before from others who got busted, but I want to let that sink in for a moment. Basically, you can be present at a murder and cheer the murderer on, but don’t participate in the murder. Otherwise, you are all good.

And Evans puts on the contrition act when he pled guilty, but he then goes out and says the 2020 Elections was “stolen.” Prosecutors wanted to add time on to his sentence for this, but the judge let that slide. Seems that the judge was tore up about giving poor Mr. Evans any time at all, but His Honor felt that Mr. Evans should do some time for his actions in the insurrection.

And Evans admits that his actions are being applauded by his former constituents. And he freely admits that his actions on Jan 6th are going to help burnish his resume for a run for higher office in WV. And sadly, I think Evans is correct.

Plenty of Republican crooks in the past have been rewarded with gigs that earn them some decent money, and some like Oliver North have been treated as heroes by conservative lunatics. Now, we are seeing more of these same criminals running for statewide or federal offices.

Why I think Evans is interesting is that he probably will run in the Republican primary in WV to take on Senator Joe Manchin. In the past, being a criminal would disqualify a man running for any political office because voters were like, “Why do I want to vote for a criminal?” But nowadays, anything goes in Republican circles.

But Evans is power hungry, and he is not the only ambitious Republican looking at Joe Manchin’s seat with envious eyes. WV is now a Republican state, and there are too many Republican politicians seeking too few open seats. And if Manchin thought that being a prick to President Biden and the rest of the Democratic Party would save him from the worst in the Republican Party, he is going to have another think coming.

The same forces unleashed by Trumpism are bound to consume WV. It is inevitable. Trump and Trumpism are alive and well in WV.",Police
dailykos,Police,4728,dailykos,"I am a student of the humble police blotter. The police blotter is compilation of of minor crime stories published daily or weekly in a shrinking number of American newspapers. A good blotter can be the most telling picture of the human condition that you will ever find. Greed, violence, jealously, thick-headedness, hypocrisy, cruelty: all the things you find in the national news and the mind of Vladimir Putin exists in the local newspaper’s blotter, in distilled form.

Maybe that’s why I cruise the police blotters of America with my laptop and recliner. To find the essence of human fallibility and turn it into structured Japanese-inspired poetry form of 17 or 34 syllables: haiku (three lines of five syllables, then seven, then five) and tanka (five lines, 5-7-5-7-7):

If it’s your car, ma’am, 

 why do you need those pliers

 to start the engine?

The perp’s story was: “No, no, officer, somebody who owed me money gave me the car. He, uh, just didn’t have the keys on him.” That one didn’t wash. But people make that sort of proposition in national politics all the time.

Sometimes the crime that I use for a haiku is not even a crime. Not exactly. The best blotters come from small-town papers, where the little things are of interest to folks So say that someone’s mouth simply gets ahead of them and makes an empty threat to commit said crime. It makes the blotter.

Think about that tanka, and then think about all the times you’ve heard a politician “walking back” a statement or threat when called on it. Or, moving on, playing the victim on behalf of themselves or the perpetrators who fund their campaigns:

If she attacked you,

 sir, then why is she the one

 with all the bruises?

And among the privileged and the powerful, there is such a thing as entitlement. A good small-town police blotter drips with entitlement.

She couldn’t believe that

 stealing her parents’ truck

 was really a crime.

Yes, think of all the politicians who think that little laws that apply to little people don’t apply to them. Or, you can go full Putin:

Yes sir, that’s his car.

 Yes, it’s in front of your house

 But it’s not “your space.”

 It’s a public space that you use.

 Stop threatening to tow him.

I imagine Vlad Putin as the entitled homeowner who’s enraged to see a handicapped van parked on the street in front of his house. That’s HIS space, because he considers it so. Sadly, this small-town Vlad has no tanks of his own. But he’d use them if he could, as the real one did! Because Vladimir Putin is the greatest emperor in history, or thinks he ought to be. Sadly, the world does not agree.

If saying was truth

 he could be king of the world.

 But he was not king.

 Nor a FBI agent

 deserving of a free lunch.

This self-aggrandizement thing is definitely going around. But the guy at the lunch counter is just some delusional person acting out. And Vladimir Putin is…. well….

Digressing for a moment: there’s a lot of weird going on in America. Has been for some time. This kaleidescope of bizarre haiku is as good a sketch of that weird as anything else.

“Are you right with God?”

 He asked, gun in hand, astride

 his riding mower

Angry skinheads trash

 a tattoo joint that refuses

 to do swastikas.

Her vacuum cleaner.

 sucked a bullet off the rug.

 Then she saw the hole.

He slashed his wife’s tires.

 Now no one wants him except

 some judge in Des Moines

Santa with an axe.

 Banging it on a stop sign.

 Friday night in Hell.

“Jesus” at Walmart.

 There are better places and

 they took him to one.

America’s in bad shape. It doesn’t know what the hell it is. All it does know is that what it is now, doesn’t work. Some want to move forward, some back.

And it’s been just the right time for a con man like Donald Trump to mobilize the angry entitled and the angry hopeless — especialyl if they’re white — with lies and promises. Now if only Trump wasn’t a half-addled narcissist with no good sense. Like some dumb kid pranking on someone else’s motorcycle:

The King of Wheelies!

 He pranced his friend’s motorbike

 into a parked car.

 He and the law spoke at length

 of his suspended license.

Donald Trump’s license will soon be suspended, one way or the other. He may be taken to “a better place,” or vanish into irrelevance and bankruptcy: possibly what he dreads most.

But the haters he mobilized continue to hate, enabled by the mini-Trumps who play to the haters and by the billionaire oligarchs here and in Russia who finance the propaganda.

We face a long struggle, but what we must remember is that what we really facing is the death spasm of a culture of inequity and hyper-concentrated wealth and power that is not only wrong but will not, cannot deal with the issues that imminently threaten humanity.

The old order can be defeated; but if we did not, it would crumble with the rest of civilization. It is leaving; you can see the signs all over the world. The question is whether we leave with it.

Court clerks, already alarmed by the measures, are also required to sign affidavits, the report said. The exact wording of the affidavits or the intended scope of the cell phone search is unknown.

In early May, Politico reported, citing a leaked draft majority opinion by US Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, that the court had voted to overturn its decision in the Roe v. Wade case.

The leaked document was confirmed to be authentic but does not represent the court’s final decision in the case. The Supreme Court has launched an investigation into the unprecedented leak.

President Joe Biden has said that the ruling that legalizes undergoing abortions throughout the United States should not be overturned. He also suggested that US voters elect more “pro-choice” lawmakers during the midterm elections in November.

The Supreme Court ruled in the Roe v. Wade case in 1973 to extend constitutional protection of women’s rights to undergo abortion without undue government restrictions. The 1992 decision in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey upheld the earlier ruling.

In an insane message from The Satanic Temple (TST) last Thursday, Lucifer-worshipping leftists say they will use religious freedom arguments in efforts to preserve their members’ rights to murder babies.

“In states that outlaw abortion but grant exceptions for instances of incest and rape, then consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, TST members should be permitted a religious exception to perform TST’s religious abortion ritual,” the Temple wrote in a statement.

The Temple also claimed it would continue fighting for speedy abortion access in states where it’s legal, and that they would also demand patients not be required to bury their aborted fetus.

“In addition, we will continue to demand that states do not require medical practitioners to withhold medical information or that patients are not forced to bury or cremate fetal remains,” the Temple bizarrely wrote.

The statement added that The Temple “is researching the possibility of creating religious abortion facilities.”

Prominent billionaires Bill Gates and George Soros have added their condemnation of the US Supreme Court decision to strike down Roe v. Wade to that of those taking to the US streets.

Gates, for his part, said that Friday was a “sad day” marking an “unjust and unacceptable setback” that puts “women’s lives at risk, especially the most disadvantaged.”

His ex-wife Melinda French Gates also weighed in on the ruling.

“One court decision was never going to be enough to protect women’s equality,” she tweeted. “And it will not be enough to dismantle it either. Right now, there are people all over the US who are recommitting to the work ahead.”

She said that the Friday decision is “America taking a big step backward”. According to French Gates, the US government should include more women so that they have an equal voice and could have a say in vital issues regarding women’s health, among other things.

In turn, investor George Soros branded the SCOTUS ruling an “assault on human rights”, which his Open Society foundation estimates may damage global democracy. Soros also added that the decision “greatly threatens reproductive care”.

The bombshell decision was made by the conservative majority in the Supreme Court, with three judges dissenting. It has already triggered massive protests across the country, with pro-choice activists flocking to the streets of Washington DC, New York, Seattle, Denver, and other major US cities.

Prominent conservatives, however, hailed the ruling.

Justice Samuel Alito has reportedly been moved to an undisclosed location for safety, after leftwing radicals attempting to intimidate conservative justices for considering overruling Roe v. Wade, all in the name of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, listed conservative justices’ home addresses online. Militant leftists, including a group called Ruth Sent Us, are trying to physically intimidate the five justices who are expected to sign the final version of Alito’s leaked opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overruling Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, with the other four justices being Clarence Thomas – appointed by Bush 41 – and the three justices appointed by Donald Trump: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.

Alito faces heightened opposition compared to other Justices since he wrote the leaked majority draft opinion considering the overturning of Roe v Wade.

Organizing protests at the homes of judges is a violation of federal law, according to 18 U.S.C. § 1507, which states:

Whoever, with the intent of interfering with, obstructing, or impeding the administration of justice, or with the intent of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer, in the discharge of his duty, pickets or parades in or near a building housing a court of the United States, or in or near a building or residence occupied or used by such judge, juror, witness, or court officer, or with such intent uses any sound-truck or similar device or resorts to any other demonstration in or near any such building or residence, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.

Despite the clear legal violation, the White House, via press secretary Jen Psaki, has tacitly endorsed the protests outside the homes of the Justices.

“We obviously want people’s privacy to be respected. We want people to protest peacefully if they want to protest. That is certainly what the president’s view would be,” Psaki stated last week.

However, the rhetoric coming from the left in the wake of the leaked SCOTUS draft opinion is anything but peaceful, with pro-abortion activists declaring that “the time for civility is over.”

Pro-abortion mobs have already surrounded the homes of Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Justice John Roberts over the weekend.

infowars,Abortion,6172,infowars,"A leftist Twitter user called on users to ponder whether the two oldest Conservative justices on the Supreme Court should be murdered in cold blood in order to preserve women’s abortion rights.

Framing his tweet as an interesting thought experiment, a leftist verified Twitter user, complete with a Ukrainian flag in his handle, questioned whether a terminally ill person, or someone with nothing left to lose should risk it all to “save many women’s lives in the future.”

“Interesting real life trolley problem in America now,” tweeted Simon Gwynn Wednesday. “If you had the chance to kill Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, the two oldest right wing Supreme Court judges, should you do it while Biden can get his nominees to replace them confirmed?”

A “trolley problem,” according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is defined as “a thought experiment in ethics about a fictional scenario in which an onlooker has the choice to save 5 people in danger of being hit by a trolley, by diverting the trolley to kill just 1 person.”

Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito would be two conservative SCOTUS Justices who would presumably be voting to end Roe v. Wade, along with Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Neil Gorsuch, giving conservatives a 5-4 majority split on the decision.

Gwynn went on to detail the type of person he envisions carrying out the homicides.

“It’s interesting as an abstract question but becomes a real conundrum if, say, you’re terminally ill and have little to lose yourself, but know that it could save many women’s lives in the future.”

Fox contributor Sara A. Carter commented she was “stunned” by the tweet showcasing the “pure evil” of the left.

In a follow-up, the user said he deleted the tweets Thursday, admitting they were “obviously pretty irresponsible,” but claimed they probably didn’t violate Twitter’s terms of service.

The tweet is exemplary of how leftists have lost their minds following the Supreme Court leak indicating federal abortion protections could soon be ended.

We Will Use Hangers! Women Respond To SCOTUS Leak",Abortion
infowars,Abortion,7905,infowars,"Roger Stone believes Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to run for president, and will announce his candidacy after the upcoming midterms.

Stone also suggested that if the GOP falls short in the midterms, which is a possibility, Donald Trump doesn’t want to take the blame, especially if congressional Republicans throw the election away – and DeSantis equally doesn’t want attention prior to the midterms.

“I happen to believe that Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor – my governor – intends to announce his candidacy literally, immediately, after the election, and I think [Trump] needs to remain mindful of that,” Stone said on the Alex Jones Show. “I still think it is more likely than not that he will be a candidate.”

“…That’s not just my instinct, that’s hard intelligence and, by the way, as President Donald Trump has said, Ron DeSantis has the right to do that.”

Trump had told insiders he was going to announce his own candidacy back in July, which never materialized, and Stone implied that it was because Trump didn’t want to influence the midterm races among other things.

It is quite likely that had Trump announced his run, it may have galvanized more Democrats to vote in November.

Additionally, if the GOP leadership threw the midterm elections to Democrats, they could’ve then blamed the loss on Trump announcing his candidacy beforehand.

On the other hand, if the GOP performs poorly in the midterms, Trump will likely blame RINO Republicans who have spoke out against “America First” candidates.

Case in point, Stone also warned that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was working behind the scenes with Democrats to keep focus on abortion and to make a major issue in the upcoming election – despite the fact that provides no upside to the GOP.

“I think Lindsey Graham – a classic RINO – working with the Democrats to make abortion front-and-center in this election,” he said.

In short, both Trump and DeSantis don’t want to be in the spotlight by announcing their runs before the midterms.

“All elections are about the incumbent party, about the job being done by congressional Democrats in combination with the Biden White House,” Stone stated.

He also threw cold water on the idea that Trump and DeSantis would run together, stating that the electoral college would get in the way as both are from Florida.

Trump also admitted that his endorsement of Oz is more strategic than ideological, claiming that he’s the most viable Republican senate candidate to run in Pennsylvania.

“Perhaps most importantly, I believe that Mehmet Oz will be the one most able to win the General Election against a Radical Left Democrat looking to do unthinkable harm to our Country. Women, in particular, are drawn to Dr. Oz for his advice and counsel. I have seen this many times over the years. They know him, believe in him, and trust him. Likewise, he will do very well in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where other candidates will just not be accepted.” “He knows his job is to serve every single Pennsylvanian Dr. Oz is smart, tough, and will never let you down, therefore, he has my Complete and Total Endorsement,” Trump concluded. “Good luck, Dr. Oz. our Country needs you!”

Unfortunately, it’s likely Trump was ill-advised by the same people who told him to endorse anti-Trump RINO Senator Mitt Romney in 2018.

That’s because Dr. Oz has a history of promoting the transgender agenda on children and toddlers, as well as abortion and other left-wing causes.

Here’s a clip of Dr. Oz on “The Dr. Oz Show” pushing for “trans kids” to have “cutting edge” gender reassignment surgery.

And contrary to Trump’s claim that Dr. Oz is “pro-life”, here’s a clip of Dr. Oz defending the Roe v Wade standards for abortion:

Additionally, Dr. Oz bragged in 2009 about helping former President Barack Obama craft his signature legislation known as Obamacare.

Dr. Oz called for red flag gun laws that use social media surveillance to determine if people should have their firearms taken away by police:

Dr. Oz also tried bullying talk show host Wendy Williams into taking the dangerous COVID-19 injection last year, but she held her ground:

Who needs the radical left when we have “America First” candidates like Dr. Oz?

All in all, not a very wise endorsement by Trump.

infowars,Abortion,6223,infowars,"In February, five Supreme Court Justices voted in camera to overturn Roe v. Wade and send the issue of abortion back to the states, where it resided until 1973.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett had all signed on to the majority opinion overturning Roe that had been drafted by Justice Samuel Alito.

The right-to-life movement was only weeks away from a stunning victory in its half-century struggle to overturn Roe.

This suggests that the leak to Politico of the Alito draft was the work of a saboteur seeking to derail the course of the court by the media explosion he or she knew it would ignite.

Whoever leaked Alito’s draft, it was a violation of an oath, an unethical act and a betrayal that ought to see the perpetrator fired in disgrace and disbarred permanently from the practice of law.

But the crucial issue now is for the Alito Five, even if unwedded to the exact language of the Alito opinion, to stay the course until the ruling comes down in late June.

For, on the substance of the abortion issue, Alito’s opinion is dead on:

“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe … enflamed debate and deepened division. It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”

“We hold that Roe … must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision.”

Indeed, at the time of Roe, January 1973, the U.S. had a long history of punishing “abortionists,” and the laws under which they were prosecuted were “spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being.”

The nation remains divided, and the issue is best decided in this democracy, Alito argues, not by unelected justices on the Supreme Court but by democratically elected representatives of the American people.

Pro-abortion Democrats say a woman’s “right to choose” must remain paramount and sacrosanct. But the “right to choose” what?

As President Joe Biden just described it bluntly this week, it is the right to choose to “abort a child.”

But at what point in a pregnancy does the pre-born child’s right to life supersede a woman’s right to abort that child. And who decides?

A New York Times front-page map this week shows that if Roe is overturned, states with liberalized abortion laws such as Illinois, California, Oregon, Washington, New York and most of New England would not be significantly affected.

It is the Republican states, the Trump states, the Mountain West and the South, where the overturning of Roe will free up Christians and social conservatives to write the regulations and restrictions that were abolished and outlawed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Roe.

These states are where the post-Roe abortion wars will be fought.

But is this not how a democratic republic is supposed to work?

Remarkable, is it not? Those who do not cease to talk about right-wing threats to “our democracy” are today the loudest and most insistent that abortion not be sent back to the states for the people and their democratically chosen representatives to decide.

While Democrats see their base energized today, we are six months away from the election. And if the Alito draft becomes law, pro-choice Democrats will have to sustain their outrage and fight political battles in virtually all the red states.

Pro-life Republicans and conservatives should stand with the Alito Five and what they have done and what, hopefully, they are about to do.

For this is what a vast slice of the party and the conservative movement has fought for, worked for, marched for and prayed for, for half a century.

If Roe is overturned, it is never coming back. It is gone for good. No Supreme Court will ever reinstate it. It will be on the ash heap of history, as President Ronald Reagan used to say.

If Biden, Nancy Pelosi’s House and Chuck Schumer’s Senate majority want to make abortion the issue of 2022 by passing a federal law codifying Roe v. Wade, if they want to die on that hill, it’s their call.

Democrats claim 60% of the nation wants Roe preserved and only 1 in 5 Americans wants Roe overturned.

Why, then, do they not pass that law codifying Roe at the national level and rely upon Roe’s supporters to produce pro-choice laws in the states where they do not today exist?

If the Alito draft opinion survives and Roe is overturned, pro-lifers will have many people to thank.

Foremost among these are President Donald Trump, who elevated to the Supreme Court three of the five justices who voted with Alito, and Sen. Mitch McConnell, who saw to it that these three alone would make it.",Abortion

The song, called “BDF” by TNFW Nique, shows black women twerking while celebrating being “Baby Daddy Free” after getting an abortion at Planned Parenthood.

Warning! The following video contains obscene imagery and explicit lyrics:

The extreme video got the attention of Candace Owens last month, who condemned the rapper’s celebration of baby murder, which the video makes clear in the song’s chorus, “Murder on my mind.”

“Do you have words? I don’t have them,” Owens said after showing a clip of the video. “I don’t have them, and I’m waiting for someone that feels that they are a better representation of black culture to speak out against this.”

The song lyrics are as follows [Warning: explicit]:

infowars,Abortion,6160,infowars,"Employees of these woke companies who live in red states will still be able to obtain abortions should Roe v. Wade be overturned.

Since conservative-leaning states began flexing their legislative muscles to outlaw abortion within their borders or severely limit its practice, companies from the likes of Amazon to Yelp have been drafting policies that will pay for employees’ abortions should they live in a state that outlaws the practice. After Politico published the leaked Supreme Court decision indicating that Roe v. Wade may be in its final days, more and more companies have been actively considering implementing such a practice, with none other than Amazon joining the fold this week.

Amazon became the latest corporation to cover employees’ travel costs to seek abortion care. The company told staff it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the nature of the Reuters report to CNN Business.

Amazon joined Citigroup, Yelp, Uber, Lyft, Bumble, Match Group, and Salesforce to draft such a policy. On Tuesday, Levi Strauss & Co. reminded its employees that its current benefits program will grant reimbursements “for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.” The company said:

Access to reproductive health care, including abortion, has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years. Further restricting or criminalizing access will jeopardize that progress and disproportionately affect women of color, putting their well-being at risk and impeding diverse hiring pipelines. Women in some states would have fewer rights than women in others, and our country would be consigned to a more unjust and inequitable future. What’s more, companies would need different health policies for different locations – including coverage for time off and travel across state lines – to ensure employees can access reproductive health care.",Abortion

“The Constitution does not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives,” read the opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito.

Pro-abortion protesters sprung to action, deploying posters which read “Bans off my Body” and other slogans.

Hours after the news broke, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) called the decision “illegitimate,” and encouraged people to get “into the streets” to protest.

Her call for what we’re sure will be ‘mostly peaceful’ protests prompted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) to accuse the Democrat of ‘launching an insurrection,’ adding “Any violence and rioting is a direct result of Democrat marching orders.”

“I will explain this to you slowly: exercising our right to protest is not obstruction of Congress nor an attempt to overturn democracy,” AOC replied, to which Greene asked AOC why she won’t support pardons for Julian Assange or Edward Snowden, why she is “a shill for the MIC (military industrial complex) funding war in Ukraine,” or “are you too busy organizing baby killing riots?”

Behind the carnival tent curtain, DC insiders are furious and are demanding that the Biden administration DO SOMETHING!

“It’s infuriating. What the hell have we been doing?” one Democratic strategist told The Hill. “Why are we not talking about this every single day? Why hasn’t Biden made this the issue for Democrats? If we don’t step up, we’ve got ourselves to blame.“

Since a leaked draft of the gut-punching Supreme Court opinion surfaced in early May, Democrats have said they wanted to see more guidance from Biden. But the president has been consumed by domestic issues including record-high inflation and the latest mass shootings in the country, in addition to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Democrats say Biden must do more to lead and fire up the base if he hopes to get Democrats to turn out this fall. “A more forceful stance would be welcome from the rank and file,” said William Galston, who chairs the Brookings Institution’s governance studies program. -The Hill

On Friday, Biden delivered a weak address from the White House, at one point struggling to find the words to describe the moment before spitting out: “It’s a – it just – it just stuns me,” even though the Supreme Court decision leaked on May 2 and everybody knew this was likely coming.

And what is Biden’s solution? After acknowledging that he’s ‘severely limited’ in what he can do as president, he encouraged Democrats to vote for pro-abortion candidates in November’s midterms that would make it possible to pass a ‘right to abortion’ law.

“This decision must not be the final word. My administration will use all of its appropriate, lawful powers, but Congress must act,” said Biden, adding: “This fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot, the right to privacy, liberty, equality, they’re all on the ballot. … And with your vote, you can act. You can have the final word. This is not over.”

Former President Obama, who in 2009 said that legislation to codify abortion rights into federal law was ‘not the highest legislative priority’ – tweeted: “Today, the Supreme Court not only reversed nearly 50 years of precedent, it relegated the most intensely personal decision someone can make to the whims of politicians and ideologues—attacking the essential freedoms of millions of Americans.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) ripped the “GOP’s dark and extreme goal of ripping away women’s right to make their own reproductive health decisions.”

Democratic strategist Joel Payne said, very strategically: “What’s challenging for the president is that all the other domestic challenges have prevented him from having the political capital to galvanize the base in a moment like this.”

“Because of Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, the Republican Party & their supermajority on the Supreme Court, American women today have less freedom than their mothers. Radical Republicans are now charging ahead with their crusade to criminalize health freedom.” Of course, unborn American children have more protections than they’ve had in 50 years.

Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called the decision “one of the darkest days our country has ever seen.”

And the Attorney General, Merrick Gardland, got extremely political, saying in an official statement: “The Justice Department strongly disagrees with this Court’s decision. This decision deals a devastating blow to reproductive freedom in the United States.”

Another Democratic strategist suggested that failure to employ Kamala Harris as the face of the White House’s pro-abortion stance is a huge mistake.

“How great would that have been?” the anonymous strategist asked rhetorically. “Why aren’t we deploying someone who understands and could speak to this moment from the heart?”

According to HIT Strategies’ chief researcher Roshni Nedungadi, 75% of young voters 18-34 years-old want abortion rights protected and don’t believe Democrats are doing enough to fight back on the issue.

“They feel that they need to see Democrats and the White House fighting for them,” she said, adding “I really think as many voices as they can have, saying the same thing over and over again.”

infowars,Abortion,8529,infowars,"A Bishop in Southern Ireland apologized for a priest’s sermon that slammed the ‘rampant legislation of sin’ as seen in the government’s positions on abortion, transgenderism, and homosexuality.

In a statement, Bishop Ray Browne apologized to “all who were offended,” adding “the views expressed do not represent the Christian position” and the message was not appropriate for a “regular weekend parish Mass.”

Browne’s Monday statement was released to appease parishioners who were outraged by Father Seán Sheehy’s homily delivered to mass-goers in Listowel on Sunday.

Watch a clip from Sheehy’s now-viral sermon for yourself:

“What is so sad today is you rarely hear about sin but it’s rampant. It’s rampant. We see it, for example, in the legislation of our governments. We see it in the promotion of abortion. We see it in the example of this lunatic approach of transgenderism. We see it, for example, in the promotion of sex between two men and two women. That is sinful, that is mortal sin. And people don’t seem to realize it, but it’s a fact, it’s a reality. We need to listen to God about it, because if we don’t, there’s no hope for those people. You have a responsibility to call people to an awareness of the fact that sin is destructive. Sin is detrimental. And sin will lead us to Hell. When we honor the saints on the first of this coming month, we honor people who are saints. Why are they saints? Because they repented, and because they sought forgiveness. As somebody said onetime, ‘Heaven is full of converted sinners.’ And so today, God says to us: ‘I have come to call sinners. But if you don’t admit you’re a sinner then you’re not listening to my call and I can’t do anything for you, because it’s a two-way street.’ Now, there are people who won’t like to hear what I’m saying. But the day you die, you will find out what I’m saying is not what I invented, it’s not what I came up with, but what God is saying. The day you die you will find out that is the truth. Our prayer for people is that it won’t be too late for people. But how will people know that God wants to forgive them, if we don’t tell them? How will people who are lost be found if we, as God’s people, don’t call them and say ‘look, God loves you, he has come to call sinners but he wants you to have life and have it to the full.’ Because that’s what he wants. He wants you to live life to the fullest. But since he’s the author of life, we can only live it through, with, and in his grace to the power of His spirit.”

Many walked out during the sermon, prompting Sheehy to bid them farewell mid-message.

“Those of you who happen to be leaving today, God help you is all I have to say.”

Sheehy has since been removed from the town’s mass roster, but is standing by his remarks and even accusing Browne of “muzzling the truth in order to appease people.”

“I know myself that what I said cannot be disproven by any honest-to-God Catholic, Christian or Catholic teaching, and that’s the bottom line.”

The robots, called Security Control Observation Towers (definitely not dystopian at all), are located by baggage claim and security checkpoints, Fortune wrote last week. They can tell whether or not a passenger is wearing a face mask.

If you’re not wearing a mask, brace yourself for a “verbal warning”, which Fortune says “could escalate in volume and severity if the infraction is not corrected”. Definitely not a scene out of Idiocracy, right? “This should help you calm down.”

Love Field is one of two airports that are testing the kiosks, which are 7 feet tall. Airports are able to set individual rules for their kiosks, the report says. Love Field has yet to determine whether or not they will become permanent fixtures, though we’d bet that it’s more likely than not.

infowars,COVID,9058,infowars,"Deaths from non-respiratory causes are projected to be a massive 10% higher than expected in 2022. Non-respiratory mortality typically varies little from year to year, changing by a maximum of just 1.3% in each of the six years from 2015 to 2020. However 2021 has registered a 3.72% increase and 2022 is projected to show a catastrophic 10.0% increase.

Because it is usually so stable, non-respiratory mortality is a useful way of showing that the ongoing excess mortality currently being experienced in the U.K. is unprecedented and unrelated to normal seasonal variation. It also shows that it has been happening ever since Covid vaccinations began in earnest in early 2021.

Respiratory disease (which is largely seasonal) is the largest component of variability in mortality statistics during the normal course of events. This means we can be justified in grouping all other mortality events together and terming them ‘core mortality’, regarding them as perhaps a better marker of the nation’s overall health. This is especially useful for the purposes of analysing the pandemic years, because Covid has replaced other respiratory diseases to some extent in the mortality statistics.

Looking at the pre-Covid data from 2015 -2019 it is possible to subtract the data for all respiratory disease (ICD code 10 J00-99), and arrive at a figure for non-respiratory mortality (NRM) for each week of the year. An average for the five pre-Covid years can then be calculated and compared with each individual year. Note we use the pre-Covid average as a baseline to avoid the unusual mortality of the pandemic years.

Here are the charts for those six years, 2015-2020, which demonstrate the relative stability of NRM statistics.

The large spike in non-respiratory mortality during weeks 14-18 of 2020 (the first five weeks of the pandemic), which resulted in 11,817 non-respiratory excess deaths compared to the 2015-2019 average, is likely a result of Covid death counting errors plus some deaths due to pandemic interventions (withdrawal of treatment, neglect, isolation etc.), as the rest of the year proceeds completely normally.

Turning to 2021 when the vaccination rollout began, the situation with non-respiratory mortality begins to change to a very erratic pattern from week 10, and then starts to show a steady increase above normal pre-Covid patterns in the latter half of the year.

This trend then continues into 2022, with a gradually increasing excess above the pre-Covid average developing as the spring and then autumn booster campaigns are rolled out.

There is one more significant factor to take account of, namely mortality displacement, as I have mentioned in previous posts. Overall mortality in 2020 was 81,478 above the five-year pre-Covid average, and in 2021 there was a further excess mortality of 53,263.

2022 is projected to end with another 42,500 excess deaths. All this excess mortality puts downward pressure on subsequent mortality statistics as it brings deaths forwards, especially because of the concentration of excess deaths during the pandemic on the elderly cohort of the population, when the average age of death has been around 83 years old.

In order to correct for this displacement, the actual mortality figures have to be revised upwards by a displacement factor of approximately 9% of the excess mortality per year, to allow accurate comparison of the mortality statistics with previous years. Doing this for the three years of the pandemic, the revised charts look like this.

Note that as the population as a whole ages, more deaths are expected each year so mortality statistics are ideally altered to reflect this trend, i.e., are age-adjusted. However the acceleration of untimely deaths of the oldest part of the population during the pandemic has significantly changed the median age of the population so this may be unnecessary.

Putting all three years together on one chart and condensing the data to four weekly aggregate figures to smooth out weekly fluctuations in the statistics, it is easy to see how the problem with excess non-respiratory ‘core’ mortality has been growing since 2021, rather than receding. 2021 shows a 3.72% increase and 2022 is projected to show a 10.0% increase. To state the obvious, this is not normal.",COVID

The Morris Sussex Family Practice announced on its website that in response to worldwide reports of adverse events in vaccinated athletes, student athletes who’ve been vaccinated cannot be cleared to compete until they undergo lab work and a heart imaging test.

Sports physicals are done primarily to make sure you are not at high risk for sudden cardiac death on the playing field. In response to worldwide experience and vaccine adverse event monitoring, we are adopting a more precautionary sports physical sign off policy. ​If you have received doses of any Covid vaccine, we will not be able to clear you to compete in sports without performing lab work and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out potential heart damage.

The precautionary measures by this practice come as athletes across the world were observed collapsing in the field or during game play since the rollout of the experimental COVID jab, resulting in death in many cases.

infowars,COVID,4836,infowars,"The state of Washington may amend a law to allow the forcible detainment of residents into COVID “internment camps” for defying state vaccine mandates.

The proposed revision to the COVID protocol under the Communicable and Certain Other Diseases Act, called WAC 246-100-040, outlines “procedures for isolation or quarantine.”

The amendment would grant local health officers at “his other sole discretion” to “issue an emergency detention order causing a person or group of persons to be immediately detained for purposes of isolation or quarantine.”

Additionally, the measure would allow law enforcement to assist public health officials in detaining residents who refused the COVID injection.

WAC-246-100-040 states that “a local health officer may invoke the powers of police officers, sheriffs, constables, and all other officers and employees of any political subdivisions within the jurisdiction of the health department to enforce immediately orders given to effectuate the purposes of this section in accordance with the provisions of RCW 43.20.050(4) and 70.05.120.”

The “emergency detention order” would allow individuals to be detained “for a period not to exceed ten days.”

This alarming measure comes in tandem with Gov. Jay Inslee’s (D) effort to hire “strike teams” to run quarantine camps, outlined in the state’s governmentjobs.com website, a term that has since been scrubbed from the website sometime after the bulletin was posted in September 2021.

Now the state website says “Isolation and Quarantine Camp Consultant” duties include “Maintaining the readiness of the facility and equipment which includes ensuring contractors have cleaned the facility adequately.”

The so-called “Isolation & quarantine team consultants” will earn $3,294 to $4,286 monthly for their services, according to the website.

Notably, WAC 246-100-040 was certified on October 25, 2019, just months before the COVID-19 pandemic began in January 2020.

Inslee further warned unvaccinated residents on Wednesday that he will soon impose even more harsh COVID restrictions to address the 146% spike in COVID cases despite 68% of Washington’s residents being “fully vaccinated.”

This comes as New York attempts to pass a similar bill allowing Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) to forcibly detain anyone she deems a public health threat.

The bill, called A.416, would “allow the governor or the appropriate health official to order the removal and detention of any person afflicted with a communicable disease in the event that there is a state of health emergency declared by the governor in relation to such disease.”

“[A]ny person or group removed or detained by order of the governor or his or her delegate shall be detained for as long as the department may direct,” the proposed bill states.

infowars,COVID,5868,infowars,"Democrat Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo’s chief of staff and two other staffers were indicted Monday on felony criminal charges related to an $11 million Covid vaccine outreach contract that was awarded to a Democrat insider.

The indictments come after Texas Rangers raided Judge Hidalgo’s offices last month.

The three staffers, Chief of Staff Alex Triantaphyllis, Wallis Nader and Aaron Dunn, were charged with misuse of official information and tampering with a government record after the contract was awarded to one-person company Elevate Strategies, LLC, a firm run by Democrat insider Felicity Pereyra, who at one time also worked for Hillary Clinton, according to Fox News.

An $11 million COVID vaccine outreach contract that was awarded to Elevate Strategies in June 2021 came under scrutiny after it was discovered some staffers of Judge Lina Hidalgo’s Office helped the vendor obtain inside information about the contract weeks before a request for proposal was open to the public. Staffers were said to also have worked to ensure another company didn’t win the contract, according to a search warrant. The staffers reportedly began communicating with Elevate Strategies CEO Felicity Pereyra about the vaccine community outreach in January 2021, a month before a request for proposal on the subject became public, the search warrant said. Four companies ultimately applied for the project after the request for proposal became public in February. The contract was awarded to Elevate Strategies in June 2021 but was later terminated in September 2021 due to the company’s inexperience with public health outreach and alleged ties to local Democratic party officials.

Click2Houston.com reports, “Calls to Judge Hidalgo’s Office have not been returned at this time,” however, lawyers for some of the indicted staffers have issued statements professing their innocence.

The felony indictments tarnish the public image of Hidalgo, who’s currently running for re-election and has been considered a rising star in the Democrat party with future statewide ambitions.

Meanwhile, regulators are also awaiting data on a three-dose course that they hope will prove more effective for children, the Associated Press has reported.

The company’s application was expected to be submitted as soon as Tuesday.

However, research shows that Covid poses a very low risk to babies and toddlers, and previous decisions to offer vaccines to children have caused controversy.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows as of January 22, there have been 280 deaths involving Covid among children aged between zero and four years old. That number rises to 603 for those aged from five to 18 years old.

Combined, deaths involving Covid among those 18-and-under make up around 0.102 percent of America’s 864,256 total deaths, as of January 22.

However, those who had been infected with an earlier variant of the coronavirus, but hadn’t been vaccinated, were between 15 and 29 times less likely to catch the virus.

A similar difference was noticed in hospitalization rates, with prior immunity conferring better protection against hospitalization than vaccination.

Despite its disadvantage compared to natural immunity, the CDC stressed that “vaccination remains the safest strategy” for preventing Covid-19 infections. This is because “having Covid the first time carries with it significant risks,” study co-author Dr. Eli Rosenberg told CNN. Likewise Dr. Erica Pan, state epidemiologist for the California Department of Public Health, recommended that even those with prior infection get vaccinated to ensure they get a layer of “additional protection.”

The study’s conclusion contradicts earlier claims from top US health officials. At the beginning of the Delta outbreak last May, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci insisted that vaccines “are better than the traditional response you get from natural infection.” Fauci has also been accused by Republican lawmakers of ignoring studies touting the benefits of natural immunity, “because it foils his plans to get everybody possible vaccinated.”

“And if I can ask you, Madame Vice President, President Biden has said that Americans will feel some pain for the sake of defending freedom and liberty. But there does seem to be no endgame in sight. How long should Americans expect, how long should we be bracing for this historic inflation and some unprecedented gas prices?” an AP reporter asked the vice president as she held a joint press conference in Bucharest, Romania with President Klaus Iohannis.

Predictably, Harris gave a rambling response that did not come close to answering the question on all Americans’ minds.

A White House transcript gives a readout of her protracted response, which ultimately concluded “there is a price to pay for democracy.”

VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Sure. In terms of the discussions that the President Iohannis and I had, they ranged in subject, including the issue of the Black Sea, and I’ll let him explain in more detail as he would like. But we are, again, fully aware and apprised because we are in constant communication with the President, with his administration here about the concerns that they have about the entire region and, frankly, the vulnerability. All you have to do is look at the map and see that where Romania exists geographically — and as is the case for our Allies on the eastern flank — that there are potential vulnerabilities, which is why we say very clearly: We will dedicate — and have been especially enhancing, over the last few weeks — our support based on their current needs. When we look at Putin’s actions — the previous question — there is — it is painful to watch. It is painful to watch what is happening to innocent people in Ukraine who just want to live in their own country and have pride in themselves as Ukrainians, who want to be home speaking the language they know, going to the church that they know, raising their children in the community where their families have lived for generations. And by the millions, now, are having to flee with nothing but a backpack.



And then you compound that with what happened a couple of days — the President talked about it today; I talked about it yesterday — in terms of a maternity hospital, pregnant women. We are — we have the unfortunate experience, all of us right now who are not in Ukraine, of witnessing horror. 



So we are committed in everything we are doing. And, yes, then the President did say in the State of the Union, there is a price to pay for democracy. Got to stand with your friends. And as everybody knows, even in your personal life, being loyal to those friendships based on common principles and values, sometimes it’s difficult. Often, it ain’t easy.

Hanover in northwest Germany turned off hot water in showers and bathrooms at public buildings and leisure areas this week. Municipal buildings in the city will be heated to only 20C (68F) between Oct. 1 – Mar. 31. The use of portable air conditioners and heating fans will be prohibited.

In Berlin, the German capital, hundreds of monuments and municipal buildings went dark to reduce electricity consumption.

And in Munich, in Germany’s south, outdoor spotlights illuminating municipal buildings were turned off as well as hot water to the buildings to save electricity.

The move to reduce energy consumption comes as EU countries earlier this week agreed on a 15% demand cut through next winter as the probabilities of reaching the 80% NatGas storage filling target dwindle as Russian state-owned energy producer Gazprom PJSC’s Nord Stream 1 capacity to Europe was slashed to just 20%.

For months, Germany has asked residents to take fewer showers to conserve power.

And the cuts to hot water and lighting might not be enough.

According to Bloomberg energy expert Javier Blas, with “Nord Stream 1 flowing at just 20% of capacity from July 27, Germany will NOT have enough natural gas to make it throughout the whole winter **unless big demand reductions are implemented**. Berlin will need to activate stage 3 of its gas emergency program.”

Germany appears to be preparing for the possible worst-case energy crunch scenario come winter. It is time for Europe’s largest economy to fire up coal-fired power plants and extend operations of nuclear power plants if they survive this coming winter.

In an interview with “Just the News” television show on Real America’s Voice airing Tuesday, Trump explained how Hunter was given $3.5 million by the wife of Moscow’s mayor a decade ago that was detailed in a 2020 Senate report.

“She gave him $3.5 million so now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it,” Trump said in an interview at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. “I think we should know that answer.”

“How is it that the mayor of Moscow, his wife gave the Biden family three and a half million dollars? I think Putin now would be willing to probably give that answer. I’m sure he knows,” he added.

Trump also said he’d like to know more about Hunter’s corrupt dealings as a board member of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings.

From Just The News:

Trump said he also would like to know more about Hunter Biden’s relationship with Ukrainian oligarch Nikolai Zlochevsky, the owner of the Burisma Holdings gas company that hired the Biden scion in 2014 to its board and paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. At the time, the State Department considered Burisma to be a corrupt company that made bribes to Ukrainian officials and viewed Hunter Biden’s relationship as having created the appearance of a conflict of interest because his father, then Vice President Joe Biden, oversaw U.S.-Ukraine policy.

Notably, Joe Biden had flown to Ukraine to threaten withholding military aid from the government if it didn’t fire the prosecutor investigating Hunter Biden’s potential corruption, which he bragged about during a Council on Foreign Relations summit in 2018.

Trump’s extraordinary call for transparency by Putin comes after the Russian Ministry of Defense released a trove of documents revealing the Hunter Biden-linked investment firm Rosemont Seneca Foundation was a benefactor of clandestine biolab facilities in Ukraine through U.S. military contractors Metabiota and Black and Veatch.

infowars,Climate Change,5173,infowars,"The dwarf galaxy NGC 1705 featured in this image from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope lies in the southern constellation Pictor, approximately 17 million light-years from Earth.

NGC 1705 is a cosmic oddball—it is small, irregularly shaped, and has recently undergone a spate of star formation known as a starburst.

Despite these eccentricities, NGC 1705 and other dwarf irregular galaxies like it can provide valuable insights into the overall evolution of galaxies. Dwarf irregular galaxies tend to contain few elements other than hydrogen or helium and are thought to be similar to the earliest galaxies that populated the universe.

The data shown in this image come from a series of observations designed to unveil the interplay between stars, star clusters, and ionized gas in nearby star-forming galaxies. By observing a specific wavelength of light known as H-alpha with Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3, astronomers aimed to discover thousands of emission nebulae—regions created when hot, young stars bathe the clouds of gas surrounding them in ultraviolet light, causing them to glow.

This is not the first time that Hubble has imaged NGC 1705. Astronomers peered into the heart of the galaxy in 1999 using Hubble’s workhorse camera at the time, the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. This instrument was replaced with the Wide Field Camera 3 during the fifth and final space shuttle mission to Hubble in 2009, and the newer instrument has provided a richer and far more detailed portrait of NGC 1705 than the 1999 observation.",Climate Change
infowars,Climate Change,6248,infowars,"In our sun’s neighborhood of the Milky Way Galaxy is a relatively bright star, and in it, astronomers have been able to identify the widest range of elements in a star beyond our solar system yet.

The study, led by University of Michigan astronomer Ian Roederer, has identified 65 elements in the star, HD 222925. Forty-two of the elements identified are heavy elements that are listed along the bottom of the periodic table of elements.

Identifying these elements in a single star will help astronomers understand what’s called the “rapid neutron capture process,” or one of the major ways by which heavy elements in the universe were created. Their results are posted on arXiv and have been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement series.

“To the best of my knowledge, that’s a record for any object beyond our solar system. And what makes this star so unique is that it has a very high relative proportion of the elements listed along the bottom two-thirds of the periodic table. We even detected gold,” Roederer said. “These elements were made by the rapid neutron capture process. That’s really the thing we’re trying to study: the physics in understanding how, where and when those elements were made.”

The process, also called the “r-process,” begins with the presence of lighter elements such as iron. Then, rapidly—on the order of a second—neutrons are added to the nuclei of the lighter elements. This creates heavier elements such as selenium, silver, tellurium, platinum, gold and thorium, the kind found in HD 222925, and all of which are rarely detected in stars, according to the astronomers.

“You need lots of neutrons that are free and a very high energy set of conditions to liberate them and add them to the nuclei of atoms,” Roederer said. “There aren’t very many environments in which that can happen—two, maybe.”

One of these environments has been confirmed: the merging of neutron stars. Neutron stars are the collapsed cores of supergiant stars, and are the smallest and densest known celestial objects. The collision of neutron star pairs causes gravitational waves and in 2017, astronomers first detected gravitational waves from merging neutron stars. Another way the r-process might occur is after the explosive death of massive stars.

“That’s an important step forward: recognizing where the r-process can occur. But it’s a much bigger step to say, ‘What did that event actually do? What was produced there?'” Roederer said. “That’s where our study comes in.”

The elements Roederer and his team identified in HD 222925 were produced in either a massive supernovae or a merger of neutron stars very early in the universe. The material was ejected and thrown back into space, where it later reformed into the star Roederer is studying today.

This star can then be used as a proxy for what one of those events would have produced. Any model developed in the future that demonstrates how the r-process or nature produces elements on the bottom two-thirds of the periodic table must have the same signature as HD 222925, Roederer says.

Crucially, the astronomers used an instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope that can collect ultraviolet spectra. This instrument was key in allowing the astronomers to collect light in the ultraviolet part of the light spectrum—light that is faint, coming from a cool star such as HD 222925.

The astronomers also used one of the Magellan telescopes—a consortium of which U-M is a partner—at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile to collect light from HD 222925 in the optical part of the light spectrum.

These spectra encode the “chemical fingerprint” of elements within stars, and reading these spectra allows the astronomers not only to identify the elements contained in the star, but also how much of an element the star contains.

Anna Frebel is a co-author of the study and professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She helped with the overall interpretation of the HD 222925’s element abundance pattern and how it informs our understanding of the origin of the elements in the cosmos.

“We now know the detailed element-by-element output of some r-process event that happened early in the universe,” Frebel said. “Any model that tries to understand what’s going on with the r-process has to be able to reproduce that.”

Many of the study co-authors are part of a group called the R-Process Alliance, a group of astrophysicists dedicated to solving the big questions of the r-process. This project marks one of the team’s key goals: identifying which elements, and in what amounts, were produced in the r-process in an unprecedented level of detail.",Climate Change
infowars,Climate Change,4912,infowars,"Scientists have announced that a remarkable planet could reveal the mysteries of many space formations, after water vapor was detected in its atmosphere.

Listed under the name TOI-674 b, the exoplanet – so called because it orbits not around the Sun, but another star – has a promising element in its detectable atmosphere. Jonathan Brande of the University of Kansas, who led the study by an international team of scientists, revealed on Thursday that water vapor had recently been discovered there.

The planet, which Brande dubbed “very rare,” orbits a red dwarf star located some 150 light years away from Earth. A light year is equivalent to six trillion miles (or 9.7 trillion kilometers), but the distance is still considered “nearby” in astronomical terms, according to NASA. The US space agency said it would now be the subject of a detailed exploration.

While researchers don’t yet know exactly how much water vapor TOI-674 b’s atmosphere holds, they have already figured out some other salient details. The exoplanet is about 1.3 times the size of Neptune and about 23 times the mass of Earth. It orbits its small and relatively cool star very tightly, completing a full circle in less than two days – that’s the length of a “year” on TOI-674 b. For comparison, it takes Neptune some 165 years to complete its journey around the Sun.

Referred to as a ‘Super Neptune’ planet for its size class, the space body, enveloped as it is in gases, is extremely rare. While thousands of exoplanets have been confirmed in our galaxy, only few in the size class between Neptune and Jupiter are known to orbit their stars in three days or less. It is believed atmospheres do not usually survive such proximity to the stars.

The close distance of an exoplanet with a detectable atmosphere to its parent star likely shows that TOI-674 b was born somewhere further away and then migrated to where it is now, according to Brande.

“Planets the size of Neptune and a bit bigger are very uncommon in these orbits – in what astronomers call the Neptune desert,” he said, speaking at a press conference for the latest meeting of the American Astronomical Society. He added that “planets in the desert are very rare,” suggesting that many of those have lost their atmospheres due to stellar radiation.

The parent star of the new subject of the astronomers’ attention cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. However, the exoplanet became accessible to telescopes with a high enough resolution to observe its atmosphere in greater detail. It “has a very large transit signal,” according to Brande.

The planet was first found by NASA’s transiting exoplanet survey satellite and further explored by the Hubble space telescope. Now researchers hope its atmosphere could be studied in more detail by another telescope equipped with special instruments called spectrographs, which can reveal certain gases.

The discovery of water vapor doesn’t make TOI-674 b a candidate for potential habitability, but it does position it as a prime target for future studies of planet formations in the star system. Looking into the chemical structure of its atmosphere in more detail will explain how it, and other stars, formed and traveled in the universe.",Climate Change

NASA has released more photos, showing “a dying star cloaked by dust and layers of light” from the James Webb Space Telescope.

“The new details from Webb will transform our understanding of how stars evolve and influence their environments,” according to the space agency.

The following side-by-side comparison shows observations of the Southern Ring Nebula, also known as the “Eight-Burst,” in near-infrared light and mid-infrared light.

“Every image is a new discovery. Each will give humanity a view of the universe that we’ve never seen before,” NASA administrator Bill Nelson said.

The Southern Ring Nebula is 2,000 light-years away from our planet.

The US space agency then revealed a photo of Stephan’s Quintet, a visual grouping of five galaxies. According to NASA, this “enormous mosaic” is Webb’s largest image to date, covering about one-fifth of the Moon’s diameter.

“It contains over 150 million pixels and is constructed from almost 1,000 separate image files.”

This compact galaxy group, which was first discovered in 1787, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus. According to NASA, four of the five galaxies in the group “are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters.”

Meanwhile, yet another stunning image from the Webb telescope reveals for the first time previously invisible areas of star birth – the Carina Nebula, located 7,600 light-years away.

“Called the Cosmic Cliffs, Webb’s seemingly three-dimensional picture looks like craggy mountains on a moonlit evening. In reality, it is the edge of the giant, gaseous cavity within NGC 3324, and the tallest ‘peaks’ in this image are about 7 light-years high. The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image,” NASA said.

Reacting to the images from the telescope, Bill Nelson said that the Webb “represents the best of NASA”:

“It maintains our ability to propel us forward for science, for risk-taking, for inspiration. We don’t want to ever stop exploring the heavens or stop daring to take another step forward for humanity.”

The telescope has also captured the distinct signature of water on a giant gas planet which orbits a star 1,150 light-years away, NASA revealed on Tuesday.”

JWST has captured the distinct signature of water, along with evidence for clouds and haze, in the atmosphere surrounding a hot, puffy gas giant planet orbiting a distant Sun-like star,” NASA said in a press release. NASA identified the planet as WAP-96 b.

The image is the most detailed of its kind ever taken and it confirms the JWST’s unprecedented ability to analyze atmospheres hundreds of light-years away, NASA said. The space agency described the impact of the first Webb images as “the dawn of a new era in astronomy.”

On Monday, US President Joe Biden released one of the first images from the Webb telescope, which, according to Nelson, was “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date.”

The image featured SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters acts as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.”

infowars,Climate Change,5598,infowars,"Major smashups between rocky bodies shaped our solar system. Observations of a similar crash give clues about how frequent these events are around other stars.

Most of the rocky planets and satellites in our solar system, including Earth and the Moon, were formed or shaped by massive collisions early in the solar system’s history. By smashing together, rocky bodies can accumulate more material, increasing in size, or they can break apart into multiple smaller bodies.

Astronomers using NASA’s now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope have in the past found evidence of these types of collisions around young stars where rocky planets are forming. But those observations didn’t provide many details about the smashups, such as the size of the objects involved.

In a new study in The Astrophysical Journal, a group of astronomers led by Kate Su of the University of Arizona report the first observations of a debris cloud from one of these collisions as it passed in front of its star and briefly blocked the light. Astronomers call this a transit. Coupled with knowledge about the star’s size and brightness, the observations enabled the researchers to directly determine the size of the cloud shortly after impact, estimate the size of the objects that collided, and watch the speed with which the cloud dispersed.

“There is no substitute for being an eyewitness to an event,” said George Rieke, also at the University of Arizona and a coauthor of the new study. “All the cases reported previously from Spitzer have been unresolved, with only theoretical hypotheses about what the actual event and debris cloud might have looked like.”

Beginning in 2015, a team led by Su started making routine observations of a 10 million-year-old star called HD 166191. Around this early time in a star’s life, dust left over from its formation has clumped together to form rocky bodies called planetesimals – seeds of future planets. Once the gas that previously filled the space between those objects has dispersed, catastrophic collisions between them become common.

Anticipating they might see evidence of one of these collisions around HD 166191, the team used Spitzer to conduct more than 100 observations of the system between 2015 and 2019. While the planetesimals are too small and distant to resolve by telescope, their smashups produce large amounts of dust. Spitzer detected infrared light – or wavelengths slightly longer than what human eyes can see. Infrared is ideal for detecting dust, including the debris created by protoplanet collisions.

In mid-2018, the space telescope saw the HD 166191 system become significantly brighter, suggesting an increase in debris production. During that time, Spitzer also detected a debris cloud blocking the star. Combining Spitzer’s observation of the transit with observations by telescopes on the ground, the team could deduce the size and shape of the debris cloud.

Their work suggests the cloud was highly elongated, with a minimum estimated area three times that of the star. However, the amount of infrared brightening Spitzer saw suggests only a small portion of the cloud passed in front of the star and that the debris from this event covered an area hundreds of times larger than that of the star.

To produce a cloud that big, the objects in the main collision must have been the size of dwarf planets, like Vesta in our solar system – an object 330 miles (530 kilometers) wide located in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The initial clash generated enough energy and heat to vaporize some of the material. It also set off a chain reaction of impacts between fragments from the first collision and other small bodies in the system, which likely created a significant amount of the dust Spitzer saw.

Over the next few months, the large dust cloud grew in size and became more translucent, indicating that the dust and other debris were quickly dispersing throughout the young star system. By 2019, the cloud that passed in front of the star was no longer visible, but the system contained twice as much dust as it had before Spitzer spotted the cloud. This information, according to the paper’s authors, can help scientists test theories about how terrestrial planets form and grow.

“By looking at dusty debris disks around young stars, we can essentially look back in time and see the processes that may have shaped our own solar system,” said Su. “Learning about the outcome of collisions in these systems, we may also get a better idea of how frequently rocky planets form around other stars.”",Climate Change

In a video posted to Twitter, social psychology researcher Gianluca Grimalda says the stunt staged by his group Scientist Rebellion is intended to highlight Porsche owner Volkswagen’s negative contribution to the “climate emergency.”

“I’m here in the Porsche Pavilion in the Autostadt of Wolfsburg to denounce the responsibility of Volkswagen in the climate emergency,” Grimalda explains beside an empty tube of super glue.

“Volkswagen is the largest car manufacturer in Europe and the second largest in the world, and the transport sector, the car sector has a huge responsibility in the climate emergency. There are 12 percent of CO2 emissions that come from the car sector.”

Things quickly got out of hand as the scientists evidently did not come prepared to answer nature’s call, and an update from Grimalda claimed Volkswagen did not fulfill a request by the scientists to provide them with a bedpan.

“@VW told us that they supported our right to protest, but they refused our request to provide us with a bowl to urinate and defecate in a decent manner while we are glued, and have turned off the heating. People in support can’t get out of the building,” Grimalda tweeted.

They wanted the heat on — during a climate protest…let that sink in.

The climate-protesting scientists were mercilessly mocked on social media for not having the least bit of foresight to predict the toilet situation.

One keen user pointed out the irony of using petroleum-derived glue to protest petroleum.

After the 45th president put the Germans on notice, the nation’s UN representatives and the mainstream media scoffed at his warning.

Popular social media page NowThis called Trump’s claims “outrageous” and noted the German delegation had a “priceless” reaction by laughing at the president.

The NowThis video called Trump’s remark an “inaccurate claim” and cited CNBC, who called the comment “not accurate” and “highly misleading.”

Shadi Hamid, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, posted on Twitter Sunday mocking mainstream media for fact-checking Trump on a future prediction.

Now, Germany and several other European countries are experiencing an energy crisis that could have deadly results.

Articles with titles such as “Germany Is Already Struggling to Keep the Lights On” and “Why Germany’s Energy Crisis and Euro Weakness Spell Trouble For The Euro Zone” are flooding media outlets.

Europe’s sanctions on Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine have placed a strain on energy grids in several nations.

Russia reduced the supply of natural gas flowing to Germany in response to sanctions and could completely cut them off if necessary.

While “Germany is considering operating its 3 remaining nuclear reactors that are scheduled to be shuttered by the end of the year through this winter,” according to the Institute for Energy Research, the nation still relies on Russia for most of its uranium fuel.

The Institute for Energy Research also points out, “Germany also gets 34 percent of its oil from Russia and 53 percent of its hard coal supplies.”

Earlier this month, Russia announced it would be shutting down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for a three-day maintenance operation at the end of August.

CNN reported the pipeline shutdown is “reigniting fears that Moscow could completely shut off gas to Europe, which is racing to stockpile supplies ahead of the winter.”

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck did attempt to spread optimism on Monday, telling citizens the nation’s gas storage facilities should soon “reach the 85% threshold.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Cabinet met for an energy summit on Tuesday, telling the media, “Coal power plants are being connected to the power grid again, bit by bit, and as you know, we are also looking into whether it makes sense to restart nuclear power plants for the winter through a careful stress test.”

“We’re in a much better situation now than was foreseeable several months ago and we are much more able to deal with the threats coming from Russia over the cutting off of gas supplies,” he added.

Meanwhile, Germany’s largest natural gas importer Uniper asked the government for an additional €4 billion ($4 billion) bailout this week.

infowars,Climate Change,8414,infowars,"Further evidence has emerged that climate models are useless for the purpose of forecasting future temperature rises.

A recent survey using American summer temperatures (June, July, August) over the last 50 years, found that 36 major climate models showed nearly twice the warming rate observed by the surface temperature measurements recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). At the high end, a number of models forecast warming nearly three times greater than observed data show (blue bar below).

The research was carried out by Dr. Roy Spencer, the principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the compiler of the UAH monthly satellite temperature record. He says that the importance of his findings should be obvious. “Given that U.S. energy policy depends upon the predictions from these models, their tendency to produce too much warming (and likely also warming-associated climate change) should be factored into energy policy planning,” he said. But he doubted it was being, ”given the climate change exaggerations routinely promoted by environment groups, anti-oil advocates, the media, politicians, and most government agencies”.

The Spencer work follows recent research published by Professor Nicola Scafetta of the University of Naples. He found that almost all the global temperature forecasts produced by models between 1980-2021 were excessive, some extremely so, compared with the accurate satellite record. One of the reasons given as to why there’s no climate emergency in the World Climate Declaration is that climate models are “not remotely plausible as global tools”.

Yet as we have seen in numerous articles in the Daily Sceptic, climate models are ubiquitous and are at the forefront of promoting the climate scares pushing the command-and-control Net Zero agenda. They are at the heart of the pseudoscientific work that tries to ‘attribute’ single extreme weather events to long-term changes in the climate claimed supposedly caused by fossil fuels. In simple terms, computers compare an imaginary climate without human-caused carbon dioxide with the current one full of unknown complexities, and then the modellers announce they’ve ‘proved’ the ‘climate emergency’ hypothesis. Since the outputs of these models are unfalsifiable – how can you prove that a wholly imaginary scenario is ‘false’? – the notions are no more than worthless opinions.

The results of Spencer’s work will hardly come as a great surprise, but the conclusions are almost certainly more damaging to the climate catastrophisers’ case than the figures suggest. Spencer uses NOAA surface temperatures and, as we have seen, these are subject to ‘corruption’ from a number of causes in recent years. As Spencer notes, the NOAA figure could be an over-estimate “if increasing urban heat island effects have spuriously influenced trends over the last 50 years, and I have not made any adjustments for that”.

Earlier this year, the U.S. meteorologist Anthony Watts published his latest survey of NOAA’s nationwide weather stations. Describing the temperature record as “fatally flawed”, Watts found about 96% of US temperature stations failed to meet what NOAA itself considered to be acceptable and uncorrupted placement. Watts defined ‘corruption’ as caused by the localised effects of urbanisation, producing heat bias because of a close proximity to asphalt, machinery and other heat-producing, heat-trapping, or heat-accentuating objects. According to Watts, data that had not been corrupted by faulty placement showed a rate of warming in the U.S. “reduced by almost a half compared to all stations”.

There is further substantial evidence that NOAA’s U.S. surface temperature figures are too high. In 2005, it started compiling data from a select group of 114 stations across the country that had been specifically sited away from urban development. Called the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN), it was intended to aim for “superior accuracy and continuity in places that land use will not likely impact during the next five decades”.

The graph above shows the rarely referenced record up to last month. It shows oscillating temperature changes, but very little evidence to indicate a warming trend over the last 17 years.

Considering what is known about the ‘corruption’ of the NOAA’s main temperature dataset, it would be reasonable to significantly reduce the blue NOAA observational bar in Spencer’s graph. This of course provides further confirmation that the temperatures forecasts of most climate models have long lost any connection with reality.",Climate Change
infowars,Climate Change,7804,infowars,"German Economic Minister Robert Habeck looked like a deer in the headlights trying to explain how businesses will be forced to close this winter but won’t suffer bankruptcies.

During an embarrassing interview on Maischberger this week, Habeck was trying to make the argument that businesses across the country won’t go into insolvency this winter despite being compelled not to produce anymore due to energy shortages brought on by sanctions against Russia.

“Do you expect a wave of bankruptcies at the end of this winter?” host Sandra Maischberger asked him.

“No, I will not do that. I can imagine that certain industries will simply stop producing for a while, not go bankrupt,” Habeck insisted.

Habeck said “there is a reluctance to buy” because items are now “twice as expensive”, which could result in businesses being forced to stop producing goods.

“Then they’re not automatically bankrupt, but they might stop selling,” he admitted.

Maischberg exposed the economic minister’s shocking lack of economic knowledge by stating the obvious: if businesses stop selling goods, they no longer make money, and therefore will go bankrupt.

“If I stop selling, then I don’t earn any money,” Maischberger pointed out. “Then I have to file for bankruptcy after two months, if I haven’t done so, I’ve delayed bankruptcy.”

Habeck agreed, saying, “You would then become insolvent if you made bigger and bigger minuses with your work.”

“Yes, but how are you not going to make bigger minuses if you pay people but you don’t sell anything anymore?” she asked. “So how should one…I didn’t understand it.”

An increasingly uncomfortable-looking Habeck insisted that insolvencies wouldn’t happen “automatically,” but that eventually “certain transactions are no longer profitable and are then discontinued.”

“Maybe they will be included again later, that can be the case, so that’s not a classic insolvency,” Habeck claimed. “But it is possible, if we do not remedy the situation, that companies – bakeries, craft businesses, cleaning companies and so on – will then stop doing business during this year.”

Maischberg at this point could no longer hide her skepticism and told Habeck he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

“So they’re broke because they can no longer work, but don’t file for bankruptcy?” she asked.

“Well, I think you really have to think about this point again, but I have the feeling you haven’t found the right answer yet,” she added.

Germany faces a natural gas shortage this winter brought on by the EU’s sanctions against Russia, which has already resulted in firewood selling out in Germany as people panic-buy to heat their homes.

infowars,Economy,6437,infowars,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell insists the central bank can fight inflation because the economy is strong. President Joe Biden keeps telling us the economy is strong.

The talking heads on CNBC insist the underlying economy is strong. In a recent podcast, Peter Schiff talked about the economy. As it turns out, it’s not so strong.

We got two earnings bombshells last week in the retail sector. Both Walmart and Target reported higher revenues, but much lower than forecast profits. Higher costs ate up those increased revenues.

The news was a one-two punch, with the Walmart earnings coming out first. Peter said it reminded investors of how bad the problem is and raised the specter of recession to a higher level.

Peter reminded listeners that he already thinks we’re in a recession.

Target said the reason for its big profit miss was surging costs caused by inflation.

“Throughout the quarter, we faced unexpectedly high costs, driven by a number of factors, resulting in profitability that came in well below our expectations, and well below where we expect to operate over time,” the earnings release said.

As Peter explained, Target customers didn’t have enough money left over after paying for necessities to pay for higher-priced, big-ticket items.

Food is a low-margin product for retailers. It gets people in the store, but Target depends on its higher-margin hardline products to drive margins.

This confirms that the “strong” retail sales numbers aren’t the great news the mainstream claims. Just because consumers are spending more doesn’t mean they are buying more.

Peter said this means Target needs to raise prices even more.

This is bad news for the economy. If Target and other companies have to keep raising prices to cover costs, they will have fewer customers. There will be more and more people unable to pay the higher prices. And if companies are going to effectively downsize through price increases, they won’t need as many workers. That means layoffs.

Meanwhile, you have Jerome Powell, President Biden, and mainstream pundits talking about how strong the economy is.

“One of the reasons they claim it’s so strong is because the consumer is so strong. The consumer is out there spending. Yeah, they’re spending. They’re spending it on food. They’re spending it on gas. They’re spending it on rent. That’s not strength. The consumer is strong when they don’t have to spend so much money on food and energy — when they have money left over to buy other stuff. … If the consumer was so strong, why are all these retailers in bear markets? Why are these stocks getting crushed? Why are profits collapsing? … What’s happening in the real world is evidence of just how weak the consumer is.”

And it’s real-world evidence that the economy itself is not as strong as the Fed, Joe Biden, and the talking heads on CNBC claim.

The only real evidence of a strong economy is the job market. Peter said that can change very quickly. All of the companies advertising for workers today could easily decide they don’t need new workers tomorrow. In fact, weekly jobless claims are on the rise.

It’s not just the cost of everyday goods that is going up. Interest rates are going up. That means consumers have to pay more on their rapidly growing pile of debt. Mortgage rates are going up.

As Peter points out, 70% of the GDP comes from consumer spending.

Powell and others spent months telling us inflation was transitory. In reality, the only thing that was transitory was the strong economy.

infowars,Economy,7109,infowars,"An economic adviser for the Biden administration said that despite historically high inflation, he can’t tell whether America is in a recession.

White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein joined “Fox News Sunday” to do some damage control about the state of the U.S. economy, claiming that despite the “unacceptability” of high inflation, the labor market and revenues are still “strong.”

“It is very hard to conclude we are in a recession when you look at the payroll and the job gains that we’ve seen,” Bernstein told host Shannon Bream. “Right now you got inflation headwinds — big time in this economy, not taking anything away from that — but you also have some very strong tailwinds that are boosting consumers.”

Bernstein went to claim that low unemployment rates and continued high consumer spending are signals that the economy is actually doing fine.

“How do we get faster revenue increases in the economy that is taking the kind of hits that we have been talking about?” he asked. “It must be a much stronger economy than a lot of people are saying, and in fact that’s the case.”

“No denial at all about the unacceptability of these elevated prices,” Bernstein added, “but underlying that is an economy with the strongest labor market in a generation.”

Predictably, Bernstein also blamed the Ukraine conflict for Joe Biden’s completely wrong forecast in December 2021 that high inflation “peaked.”

What Bernstein omitted, or perhaps failed to realize, is that high spending isn’t a result of Americans having more money, but the fact that Americans must pay much more for necessities like gas and food this year.

In addition to spending 15% more on gas and food than this time last year, one in every five Americans are now skipping meals and 50% are cutting down on meat to make ends meet.

Perhaps that’s why 56% of Americans believe the U.S. is already in a recession, according to a recent poll from The Economist and YouGov.",Economy
infowars,Economy,7652,infowars,"The 80% rise in the U.K.’s cap for consumer electricity and natural gas bills this fall will drive millions of households into energy poverty this winter as the worsening cost-of-living crisis stokes fears of recession.

All the chatter today among British people is energy regulator Ofgem’s rise in the cap on power bills to a record £3,549 ($4,189) beginning Oct. 1 from £1,971 ($2,330) at present. That cap is expected to rise to £5,439 ($6,427) by January and £7,272 ($8,594) by spring — all due to skyrocketing wholesale NatGas and electricity prices caused by declining Russian energy supplies to Europe, made worse by Western sanctions that have backfired.

“An increase of this much cannot be budgeted for by households with no wiggle room,” said Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy for the National Energy Action charity. “Come October, low-income households will simply not turn on their heating.”

Reuters spoke to one Brit, Philip Keetley, who said:

Another Brit, Dawn White, who has kidney failure, fears the cost of soaring energy costs means she won’t be able to afford life-saving medical treatment:

Soaring energy inflation has crushed real earnings for Brits, forcing many to pull back on spending.

The higher cap rate could push inflation to even more elevated levels as U.K. economists at Citi warned CPI inflation could reach a mindboggling 18.6% print in January due to soaring energy prices.

The last time CPI printed above 18% was during the stagflationary years of the mid-1970s (more precisely, 1976) after an oil supply shock led to soaring energy prices worldwide.

Currently, the CPI stands at 10.1% in July for the first time in four decades, primarily driven by skyrocketing food and fuel prices as households crumble under the weight of the cost of living crisis.

Inflation at decades highs has pushed U.K. Misery Index, an economic indicator to gauge how the average person is doing, to three-decade highs, a sign discontent is emerging.

“It’s going to be horrendous,” said Bill Bullen, chief executive officer of Utilita Energy Ltd., which supplies 810,000 homes in the U.K. “We are going to see a big increase in people struggling to pay for their energy bills.”

Last winter’s cap was £1,277, but that was before European leaders sanctioned the hell out of Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine. With the cold season just a few short months away, power prices are already at record highs as Russia’s Nord Stream 1 NatGas pipeline to the bloc experiences supply disruptions.

This winter could be one of the darkest in decades for U.K. households. The government has provided billions of pounds to support families, but that may not reduce the growing discontent.

The resistance is growing as more than 116,000 irritated people have pledged not to pay their electricity bill this fall when the new price cap begins, in a movement called “Don’t Pay U.K.”

infowars,Economy,5272,infowars,"St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard unwittingly let the cat out of the bag and revealed the central bank doesn’t have the stomach to do what’s necessary to take on surging, persistent inflation.

After January’s CPI data came in even hotter than expected, Bullard shocked markets by calling for a full 1% rate hike by July. As CNBC reported, his comments sent stocks “on a wild ride” as futures markets began to price in as many as seven quarter-point rate hikes in 2022. That would push interest rates to 1.75% by the end of the year.

But just a day later, Bullard appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box and did damage control. He didn’t back off his call for a 1% hike by this summer, but he did walk back his hawkishness, describing it as “front-loading” the Fed’s planned tightening.

Bullard described his comments as “shading up” his position, and he emphasized he’s just one person on the committee.

Most significantly, Bullard insisted the Fed will continue to provide “accommodative” monetary policy.

In other words, despite “a lot of inflation,” the Fed’s plan is to continue creating inflation with an accommodative monetary policy. Or to put it another way, the central bank will continue to pour gas on the inflationary fire.

Bullard’s damage control underscores the painful reality the Fed finds itself in. As economist André Marques put it, the Fed is trapped. It doesn’t really have room to raise rates or taper.

This is why Bullard emphasized the central bank can raise rates to address inflation, but “we can do it in a way that’s organized and not disruptive to markets.”

The freakout in the markets after Bullard’s initial statement on rate hikes is exactly why the St. Louis Fed president went on CNBC to do damage control and walk back his comments. Because deep down everybody knows any significant rate hikes will pop this bubble economy built on artificially low interest rates and monetary stimulus.

The reality is hiking interest rates 1 or 2 percent over the next year or two is not a tight monetary policy and it will do little nothing to get ahead of the inflation curve. Peter Schiff made this point in a recent interview on Fox Business. Keep in mind, Paul Volker had to raise rates to 20% in the early 1980s to tame the inflation of the 1970s. Inflation is every bit as high today if measured honestly.

“If we still measured inflation the way we did 40 years ago, it would be 15%, not 7.5%. And the rate hikes they’ve proposed are completely inadequate. In fact, the Fed is intending to pursue an accommodative monetary policy. Even if they raise interest rates to 1 or 2%, that is highly accommodative. That’s the same type of interest rates they had when inflation was below 2%. You’ve got inflation at 7.5%, even the way they measure it – and rising. The only way to put out this fire is to have positive real interest rates. The Fed needs to get above the inflation rate. We’re not even going to get close. So, they’re going to continue to pour gasoline on the fire. And so, the entire time the Fed is inching up rates, inflation is actually going to be moving higher. Inflation is going to be worse in 2022 than it was in 2021, and real interest rates are going to continue to fall even as the Fed raises nominal rates.”

Bullard unwittingly let the cat out of the bag. To the extent that it enters the ring to fight, it’s going to lose because it doesn’t have the will to really fight. Peter made this point in a recent podcast.

The Fed will raise rates a little. As Peter put it, the central bank has to pretend it’s going to fight inflation, especially with inflation now widely considered a problem.",Economy
infowars,Economy,6730,infowars,"Both consumer prices and producer rose near to multidecade highs last month.

Price inflation rose to 8.6 percent while wholesale producer prices rose by more than 10 percent.

In both cases, a significant factor behind rising prices—but certainly not the only factor—was high energy prices. This has been reflected in prices related to transportation and shipping. Prices for air travel, for example, have seen some of the biggest price increases in recent months while gasoline (naturally) has fueled sticker stock for households across the nation.

Perhaps most notable to the average consumer has been the increase in gas prices. In June, gasoline prices have risen on average to a new nominal high of over $5 per gallon.

Short of recession (or depression), relief will likely have to come in the form of increasing supply. The easy-money policies of the central bank have fueled spikes in demand for nearly all products, but this leads to a problem: rising demand has not come with rising production. In other words, the regime can easily increase the supply of money, by simply creating money out of thin air. But the regime can’t do the same with oil or gasoline. Unlike fiat money, oil and gasoline must actually be extracted and processed.

So, we end up with increasing supplies of dollars chasing oil and gas supplies that are increasing at a much slower pace. The result is rising price inflation.

Unfortunately, there does not appear to be much relief on the horizon. US bans on Russian oil have disrupted global oil markets and cut off the US consumer from ready imports. This certainly hasn’t helped bring crude oil prices down. But when it comes to gasoline prices, another sizable factor is the fact refineries are running below past capacity. Even when US markets have access to crude oil, gasoline production lags.

Much of this is being blamed on logistical problems stemming from covid lockdowns and the collapse in demand that occurred in 2020. As governments across the US forcibly closed businesses and issued stay-at-home orders, many refineries became unprofitable and closed. Shortly thereafter, an avalanche of newly created money whipsawed demand in the opposite direction, and refineries could not keep up. Spiking prices resulted.

Ultimately, the situation only illustrated what more astute observers had pointed out: claims that policymakers could “pause” the economy, and that we need only wait for the “V-shaped recovery” for everything to bounce back to normal, were very wrong.

During the worst days of the covid lockdowns, gasoline prices fell to around a dollar per gallon in many areas. The national average fell to near $2 per gallon in 2022 dollars.

But by late 2021, fueled by trillions in newly printed money, gasoline prices surged to ten-year highs. As of June 2022, gasoline prices have hit new highs of over $5 per gallon. Even in inflation adjusted terms, gasoline will soon hit some of the highest prices seen in many decades.

Notably, gasoline prices have been outpacing crude oil prices when it comes to inflation-adjusted prices. With crude oil prices rising to around $120 per barrel in recent weeks, inflation-adjusted prices have not yet risen to some of the highs we’ve seen since the 1970s. In the lead-up to the housing crash of 2008, for example, the oil price rose to nearly $180 per barrel (in 2022 dollars).

The fact oil prices haven’t topped recent highs is due in large part to the resilience of international markets.

The Biden administration certainly did its best to drive oil prices through the roof, and thus to make life more difficult for the average American. In March of this year, the administration issued a decree banning Russian “crude oil and certain petroleum products” from the US. The administration boasted that American consumers would be cut off from 700,000 barrels per day of Russian oil imports. Defenders of this policy lectured Americans on the need for “sacrifice”—by paying higher prices for oil—in order to make Washington’s Russophobes happy. This was part of a larger plan to pressure the regimes of the world into cutting Russia off from global markets.

This has certainly succeeded to drive up crude prices above what they would have otherwise been. Fortunately, the plan has also partly failed. China and India have been buying up large amounts of Russian crude ensuring that supply remains in the global market. This means global supplies are not strained as much as would have occurred had the Biden administration’s attempt at isolating Russia succeeded.

But while access to crude has not evaporated as intended by the US regime, refinery capacity continues to lag. This has driven up gasoline prices to higher peaks than crude.

Nor is increasing capacity an easy affair. As Business Insider reported this week:

So much for that allegedly easy-to-reverse pause in the global economy we were told was no big deal. When running a single refinery is “very complicated” imagine the complexity of an entire economy.

In response, the usual anticapitalist response has been to place the blame on imagine “price gouging” or “greedflation.” President Biden has reportedly sent an “angry letter” to oil company execs for not bringing down gas prices. Never mind, of course, that the administration has been committed to crippling fossil fuel production for the duration.",Economy
infowars,Economy,7065,infowars,"A recent essay on the Mises Wire triggered quite a bit of discussion among a group of Austrian school economists.

Paul H. Kupiec and Alex J. Pollock’s “Who Owns Federal Reserve Losses and How Will They Impact Monetary Policy?” became the focal point for a wide-ranging discussion of monetary issues that got to the heart of our monetary and overall economic future.

The Fed Cannot Go Bankrupt

The article itself is a fairly straightforward explanation of how the Fed works, and provides several options that the Fed might pursue in a rising interest rate environment. The authors contend that the Fed has intervened itself into a corner, where losses probably will increase as the Fed raises rates. David Howden opined that this might not happen, as the Fed will roll over its mostly short-term, low-yielding investments into higher-earning assets, which will tend to protect its net interest income and provide an operating profit. Furthermore, the Fed is not required to mark its low-yielding investments to market. Were it required to do so, the Fed’s true financial weakness would be revealed.

The Fed Ignores the Rule of Law

But what can or will be done about it? Early in their essay, Kupiec and Pollock conclude that nothing will be done, despite the provisions of the law that created the Fed over one hundred years ago. The losses will not go away; they simply will be transferred to the unwitting public through loss of purchasing power. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

The “innovation” in accounting policies centers around the Fed’s newly minted “deferred asset” account, to which underwater assets will be transferred. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

If the Fed were subject to the rule of law, either it would have stopped money printing years ago or its creditors would have forced it to close its doors. Yet the rule of law is completely ignored. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

The Keynesians running our economic life may be reassured that the Fed cannot fail in a technical sense, but the public should be appalled. The continual monetization of the federal budget threatens the complete loss of the dollar’s purchasing power—to wit, a Weimar Republic–style catastrophe.

Today’s monetary leaders fail to understand the true nature of money and, therefore, cannot conceive that there are real consequences to their outlandish irresponsibility in monetizing government debt and brazenly dismissing the rule of law. As the facilitator of monetary debasement, borne by the general public, the Fed fosters the destruction of societal capital.

The federal government does not have to answer to the law nor the public for its irresponsible and destructive spending. The purpose of insolvency is to force an institution, whether public or private, to stop destroying capital. Austrian school economists understand that capital must be created by hard work, innovation, frugality, and, most of all, savings. The market allocates scarce capital to those enterprises that create things worth more than those scarce inputs.

The Solution Is a “Return to Sound Money”

In 1953 Ludwig von Mises added a relatively short final chapter to his 1913 masterpiece The Theory of Money and Credit. Chapter 3 of part 4 is titled “The Return to Sound Money.” It is as relevant today as it was almost seventy years ago. Mises explains how the US in particular could anchor the dollar to its gold reserves. The Fed would be eliminated and replaced by little more than a board that would monitor all dollars to make sure they are backed 100 percent by gold.

Mises was a master in presenting what self-serving Keynesian scholars try to hide in a fog of deception; i.e., that money can and should be subject to the rule of law, as are all other economic goods in society. I daresay that there is no single reform that comes closer to fostering peace, freedom, and prosperity than a “return to sound money.”",Economy

“They’re not concerned about inflation, they’re not concerned about — which is not to say you can’t care about everybody, but there’s something that’s out of balance,” he said. “And so, I think that when we start sending the cultural signal that we’re more concerned about the pronoun you put on your Zoom call than we are concerned about the fact that you don’t have a house or a job, I think the party is off track.”

The CNN commentator also admitted that the American people have been “sold down the river” by Democrats and establishment Republicans alike.

“I understand how people can sometimes feel that they are being left behind, they’re being left out, they’ve been sold down the river by both parties,” Jones added. “And I think the Democrats miss opportunity after opportunity to tell people we get that and we care about it.”

The latest example of the Democrat disconnect is California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), who, despite violent crime and homelessness skyrocketing in his state, recently signed a bill that would make the state a “sanctuary” for children to receive gender reassignment surgeries without knowledge or consent from parents.

This comes as the latest polling from ABC News shows House Democrats lagging behind Republicans by double digits in virtually every battleground state ahead of the midterm elections.

infowars,Economy,7980,infowars,"An invention that is yet to be patented, is marketed by its author as “the world’s first Covid-19 doorbell” – a multi-biometric device called Pulse Secure Doorbell, the intellectual property (IP) of which has been offered for sale or licensing with a price tag in excess of a million dollars.

This doorbell is the brainchild of Ross Markbreiter, who appears to be behind Pulse Security Systems. The content-wise sparse website for the project states that what makes the device “unique” is that it is equipped not only with a camera but also an infrared (IR) “beam” (thermometer) that takes a person’s temperature, as well as a fingerprint scanner that takes the pulse and starts biometric scanning to confirm identity.

The camera is used for facial recognition, and what increasingly sounds like a full-fledged “biometric lab” rather than any “doorbell” you currently know of also incorporates a microphone for voice recognition.

If the checks are completed to the satisfaction of whatever the requirements of those who use the system are, green lights will be on, all the elements will turn on, and the door opens. If not, access is denied.

“There is a speaker and a 911 button. A person will contact you if needed,” the website states.

Given that the world appears to be on the tail-end of Covid-related restrictions, including various forms of surveillance ushered in with the pandemic, it might seem that this type of tech is poorly timed; however, the general trend towards ever more present and finely-grained biometrics-based surveillance would indicate that this product might find its market beyond Covid.

Indeed, according to the author – even though Pulse Security Systems calls Pulse Secure Doorbell “the first Covid-19 doorbell” – it checks not only for health but also identity – “and more.” And as such can be installed in homes, schools, workplaces, hospitals, nursing homes, and prisons.

The site explains that it can be integrated into existing security systems and then, for example, used to monitor school and work attendance.

A non-provisional patent application (i.e. one that will be examined by the patent examiner) has been filed for Pulse Secure Doorbell, the site informs.",Economy
infowars,Economy,9149,infowars,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has frequently bragged that Florida is in high demand among people looking to relocate.

In a new report released this week from the Census Bureau, it seems that he’s been correct. According to the Bureau’s report:

In raw numbers, that amounts to an increase of about 416,000 people, which is the size of a medium-sized American city. This quickly leads to the question of why so many people are moving to Florida. Much of this narrative—at least among Florida boosters—has centered around the idea that Florida became a place to go to obtain freedom from lockdowns, mask mandates, business closures, and other covid-panic measures imposed by state governments.

Events like migration are always complex events, of course, but when we look at the Census Bureau’s new migration data on changes from 2020 to 2022, it sure looks like the data backs up the idea that a great many people are moving from restrictionist covid states to states where daily life is a little less regimented. It is likely that these trends also reflect larger trends in which Americans are moving from high-tax, highly regulated, expensive states to more affordable regions.

To get a better view of the post-covid trend, let’s broaden our scope to population trends from 2020 to 2022. (The data reflects a July estimate for each year, so we’re talking about changes from July 2020 to July 2022.)

In this case, we find that Florida is in the top three of states with big population changes since 2020. But it’s behind both Montana and Idaho. Idaho’s population has grown 4.9 percent since 2020, while Montana and Florida have growth of 3.3 percent and 3 percent, respectively. The story coming out of Idaho has been that a very large number of Californians relocated there during Covid lockdowns, and also as a means of escaping California’s increasingly interventionist state. Florida, on the other hand, apparently tends to get migrants from the northeastern United States.

The Census data at least supports the thesis that people are indeed leaving both California and New York in large numbers. As far as taxes and covid policies go, Illinois could be lumped in with California and New York as well. Indeed, looking at population change since 2020, California, Illinois, and New York are all in the top five for falling population. Since 2020, New York has lost more than 2 percent of its population while California has lost 1.2 percent of its population. Illinois is the second worst, losing 1.6 percent of its population. (The bottom five is filled out by the low-income states of West Virginia and Louisiana.)

When we look at raw numbers, we find that Texas tops the list. In fact, both Florida and Texas added more than half-a-million people from 2020 to 2022. Texas added more than 700,000 and Florida added more than 600,000. For context, we could note that the city of Memphis has 630,000 people. Milwaukee has 575,000 people.

Meanwhile, during this period, both New York and California lost more than 400,000 people each. Illinois lost more than 204,000. No other states come even close in terms of total number of people who moved away.

In fact, eight of the top-ten states for population growth from 2020 to 2022 are arguably so-called “red states,” with blue Delaware and purple Arizona filling out the top ten. The bottom ten are either blue states or red states with stagnant economies.

These numbers reflect longer-term trends away from high-tax, expensive, Democrat-controlled states toward the south and West. For example, from 2010 to 2020, eight of the top ten states for population growth were arguably “red states.” Utah and Arizona topped the list with 18.4 percent growth and 17.3 percent growth, respectively. Meanwhile, California’s growth rate was one-third that of Utah, at a rate of 6.1 percent. New York grew 4.2 percent during the period.

Indeed, the relative growth rates seen here were reflected in the new Congressional apportionment process in which Texas and Florida both gained seats in Congress while New York and California both lost seats.

The “Experts” Say New York Is One of the “Best” States

Interestingly, these numbers repeatedly contradict what the “expert class” repeatedly tells us about how the “best” states in the Union are places like California, Massachusetts, and New York. For example, in September, Federal Reserve economists Elena Falcettoni and Vegard Nygaard published a new study purporting to provide an objective measure of “living standards across the United States” according to metrics like consumption, education, leisure, and inequality. The researches concluded that eight of the top ten “best” states were New England states, plus New York and New Jersey. North Dakota and South Dakota filled out the list. California and Illinois came in at 16th and 15th, respectively.

Many hundreds of thousands of American state-to-state migrants do not appear to have received this memo. Instead, of the top-ten “best states” in this list, North Dakota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York all lost population from 2020 to 2022. Meanwhile, the states that gained the most population during this period were all ranked within the bottom half of the “best” states according to Falcettoni and Nygaard.

Apparently, New York isn’t quite as attractive to many Americans as Federal Reserve economists think it should be.",Economy
infowars,Economy,5732,infowars,"In this world of monetary insanity, defenders of central bank constant easing try every day to convince you that inflation is caused by numerous factors, not by currency printing.

Many blame inflation on cost-push factors or even speculation, but ultimately all those are consequences, not causes. Rising prices are always caused by more units of currency being directed to scarce or tangible assets.

Commodities exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a clear example. In 2022, investors have been purchasing these products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns. These purchases are not a cause; they are a consequence. With increased inflationary concerns, the likelihood of rising interest rates, and elevated geopolitical concerns, commodity-focused funds have seen record inflows in 2022. Year to date through February 25, commodities ETFs gathered $8.5 billion of net ETF inflows, according to Wealthmanagement.com. This is not the full picture, though. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the total value of various commodity index-related instruments purchased by institutional investors has increased from an estimated $15 billion in 2003 to an estimated $200 billion. The global commodity-services market size is estimated at $4 trillion in 2020, according to Market Research.

In 2020, most investors were very underweight in energy and commodities. The surge in socially responsible investment as well as the recent history of underperformance of commodities relative to bonds and equities had created an enormous underweight. As concerns about inflation and geopolitical events unraveled, funds reallocated capital from underweight to equal weight and now, in 2022, to overweight.

This happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy. Between 2020 and 2021, the assets of the major central banks rose by more than $10 trillion. Furthermore, broad money supply (M3) growth rose at a double-digit rate in 2020 and 2021 in the major economies.

Obviously one or two prices may rise independently due to particular events. A war can cause that, but not a generalized and widespread increase in all prices. Furthermore, commodity and food prices were already rising to multiyear highs even before the Ukraine invasion was a rumor.

Readers may believe that all this is due to trader speculation, but trader actions work both ways. Traders do not create prices; they trade on them. Furthermore, traders cannot influence the marginal price of a commodity for long if the fundamentals, inflation, and money reality are not there. There are numerous reports from the CFTC proving that investing does not impact commodity prices. Between 2013 and 2019, commodity prices were not rising. Why? Because broad money growth was not rising above real demand for money.

Oil and gas have risen equally everywhere, yet Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is vastly different in the euro area and the United States compared to countries where energy imports are much higher, like Japan and Korea. Why is CPI inflation twice as high in the euro area and the US relative to those Asian countries? Much higher broad money growth in 2020–21.

The Ukraine war has created another excuse to blame inflation on oil and natural gas. However, it seems that all those who blame inflationary pressures on commodities continue to ignore the massive price increases in housing, healthcare, and education, as well as in goods and services where there was evident overcapacity. Global food prices show a similar problem. The United Nations and Food and Agriculture Organization Food Price Index has been rising steadily and reached all-time highs even before the covid crisis.

Oil and gas will be used as an excuse for inflation as long as low interest rates and massive currency creation remain. But the reality is that when both deflate somehow, the problem of currency debasement will remain.

Inflation was already higher than the CPI measure suggested before the covid-19 crisis. The rise in the prices of nonreplicable goods and services, shelter, healthcare, fresh food, and education was significantly higher than the CPI percentage. According to Deutsche Bank, these were rising up to five times faster than the CPI. There was high inflation in the things that we consume every day even in the days when some said there was “no inflation.”

Now the increase in broad money has translated to an explosion in all prices, energy-related or not. Some will blame wages, others will blame the Ukraine war, and others will blame the weak recovery. The fact is that currency destruction is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere. Everything else is anecdotes or consequences, not causes.

More units of currency are going to scarce assets as investors look for protection against inflation. This is not speculation; it is protection from currency debasement.",Economy
infowars,Economy,9150,infowars,"The Biden regime failed to pay National Guard troops their year-end pay on time during the week of Christmas, according to reports.

This comes after Biden and Congress approved another $45 billion aid package to Ukraine and the House passing a $1.7 trillion spending plan.

“Hello gents,” began a letter sent to members of the National Guard, obtained by The Post Millennial, “if you have been tracking, the pay issue that has been plaguing the unit and the division as well.”

“You are probably already tracking there are pay issues. Many soldiers were due pay today.”

“They received LES but did not receive funds,” the letter noted, referring to a Leave and Earning Statement, a pay stub without accompanying funds.

The letter added the lack of pay is a “nation wide” issue, which “seems to be at DFAS [Defense Finance and Accounting Service] and is related to the CR.”

“This is unfortunate and can cause serious issues and aggravation across the formation which are understandable. Especially 2 days before Christmas,” the letter stated. “I think the messaging is important that it’s understood the issues are at the highest levels and that everyone in the Division and State are pushing for immediate resolution.”

Another email posted on Twitter by Georgia National Guard soldier James Jarrett revealed that payments won’t be fulfilled until the 2023 budget is signed by Congress.

“All payments scheduled for 23 DEC are being held until the new FY23 budget is fully approved and signed congress passed the FY23 budget yesterday the housr [sic] has to approve it and then to POTUS to sign hopefully by today.”

“With that being said, DFAS is holding all payments until new budget is signed,” the email continued. “From what im being told funds hopefully will be released tonight if it’s signed by POTUS today.”

Meanwhile, the House approved the $1.7 trillion spending plan on Friday, $45 billion of which is earmarked for Ukraine.

The bill will now head to Biden’s desk.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky feels so entitled to U.S. taxpayer money that he even complained to Biden that $45 billion wasn’t enough!

Ironically, Biden had spouted platitudes on Twitter about taking care of American soldiers just a day before Congress approved billions of dollars to Ukraine.

“We have a lot of obligations as Americans, but we have only one sacred obligation: To prepare those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home,” he tweeted Wednesday.

If this unfortunate development doesn’t expose the Biden regime’s America Last priorities, than nothing does.

Neada said electricity prices had increased significantly since 2020 after a decade of stagnation. The steep rise has resulted in billions of dollars in overdue power bills.

Electricity inflation is being propelled by soaring costs of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, coal, and petroleum.

NatGas fuels about 40% of the US power grid and soared to the highest levels since 2008 on Tuesday.

The chart below shows for the two decades, real electricity prices were relatively flat, except for the commodity boom times around the 2008 GFC. Now CPI less energy has peaked, though electricity continues to rise to a blistering 30% year on year.

Utility shutoffs have become more common across the US as some lower-tier households are thousands of dollars behind on their power bills.

Jean Su, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which tracks utility disconnections across the US, warned of a “tsunami of shutoff” as the highest inflation in forty years eats away wages and has financially devastated the working poor.

Adrienne Nice is one of those struggling Americans who is more than $3,000 behind on utility bills. Last month, she received a “final notice” from power company Xcel Energy Inc., who turned off the electricity to her studio apartment in Minneapolis as temperatures approached near triple digits.

Nice found it near impossible to save money for utility expenses that have doubled over the past year as food, shelter, and gas prices have also skyrocketed. Her low-paying job as a housecleaner has left her in energy poverty.

Across the country, power companies reported a surge in non-payment customers. California’s PG&E Corp said there had been a 40% jump in the number of residential customers behind on payments since February 2020. New Jersey’s Public Service Enterprise Group said customers at least 90 days late have risen 30% since March.

Readers know that low-tier consumers are financially tapped out. They’ve maxed out credit cards, depleted savings, and have seen wage gains wiped out due to inflation. It comes as no surprise the US is becoming more like Europe, where energy poverty has doomed millions of households.

What we saw in Texas earlier this year was confirmed yet again tonight: President Trump’s endorsement is the most important endorsement in politics. His endorsed candidates are a combined 55-0 in 2022 primaries, a continuation of the historic endorsement streak of success that started during his time at The White House.

Populist candidate J.D. Vance’s win in the crowded Ohio Senate primary is welcome news to other Trump-endorsed candidates and is a potential harbinger of things to come in upcoming races in other states. Making Vance’s victory all the more impressive was his ability to stave off the crowded senate field with three other candidates who sought Trump’s endorsement, in addition to being targeted by the Republican establishment and donor class. Vance, who authored the best-selling book Hillbilly Elegy, received Trump’s endorsement on April 15 and enjoyed a substantial boost in the polls following the 45th President’s nod. Trump’s team tells Breitbart News that Vance was polling around ten percent in fifth place before Trump’s backing. He took home 32 percent of the vote Tuesday.

JD Vance put in tremendous work and has immense political talent—which put him in the position to earn the support of President Trump—but it was the endorsement of President Donald J. Trump that took a candidate who many insiders said was in 4th and at single digits in the polls, and in only two weeks, propelled him into a commanding first place finish.

“Just saw Mike Pence’s statement on the fact that he had no right to do anything with respect to the Electoral Vote Count, other than being an automatic conveyor belt for the Old Crow Mitch McConnell to get Biden elected President as quickly as possible,” Trump stated Friday.

“Well, the Vice President’s position is not an automatic conveyor if obvious signs of voter fraud or irregularities exist. That’s why the Democrats and RINOs are working feverishly together to change the very law that Mike Pence and his unwitting advisors used on January 6 to say he had no choice.”

“The reason they want it changed is because they now say they don’t want the Vice President to have the right to ensure an honest vote,” the former president conitnued. “In other words, I was right and everyone knows it. If there is fraud or large scale irregularities, it would have been appropriate to send those votes back to the legislatures to figure it out.”

“The Dems and RINOs want to take that right away. A great opportunity lost, but not forever, in the meantime our Country is going to hell!” he added.

Pence had defended his decision to certify the stolen 2020 election Friday during a speech to the Federalist Society in Florida.

“There are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer over the joint session of Congress, I possessed unilateral authority to reject Electoral College votes. And I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to ‘overturn the election,'”Pence said.

“President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election,” he added.

As Trump pointed out, Democrat lawmakers are hard at work in their effort to advance legislation that would strip the vice president of Constitutional powers Pence claims he never had to begin with.

“If the Vice President (Mike Pence) had ‘absolutely no right’ to change the Presidential Election results in the Senate, despite fraud and many other irregularities, how come the Democrats and RINO Republicans, like Wacky Susan Collins, are desperately trying to pass legislation that will not allow the Vice President to change the results of the election?” Trump asked last week.

“Actually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away,” he added.

Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.), ranking member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, issued a letter Monday to Zuckerberg demanding an explanation of his company’s role in suppressing the Hunter Biden story at the behest of the FBI to help Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.

“The American people deserve to know whether the FBI used Facebook as part of their alleged plan to discredit information about Hunter Biden,” said the letter, which was obtained and published by the New York Post. “If so, Congress and the American people require clarity with respect to the extent the FBI communicated with Facebook during the 2020 election about Hunter Biden-related information.”

The senators referred to a recent interview Zuckerberg had with podcast host Joe Rogan as evidence of FBI election interference.

“On the August 25, 2022, episode of the podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, you noted that at some point leading up to the 2020 election the FBI came to Facebook with a warning: ‘Basically the background here is the FBI, I think basically came to us – some folks on our team – and was like, ‘Hey, just so you know, you should be on high alert. We thought that there was a lot ofRussian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there’s about to be some kind of dump that’s similar to that. So just be vigilant’,” the letter stated.

“You appeared to indicate that as a result of the FBI’s warning, Facebook eventually tooksteps to censor news articles about Hunter Biden’s laptop. Specifically, you said that ‘distribution’ of those articles on Facebook was decreased and explained that ‘the ranking an newsfeed was a little bit less. So fewer people saw it than would have otherwise.’ Although you noted that users could still share the articles, you clarified that the number of users who could see it decreased by a ‘meaningful’ amount,” the letter added.

The senators then requested documents showing Meta’s internal communications with government agencies, discussions of the New York Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story, and all correspondence with the FBI showing its 2020 election interference:

1. All records between and among Facebook, FBI, Department of Justice, and other government agency employees referring or relating to Hunter Biden including, but not limited to, Russian disinformation, Hunter Biden’s laptop, and Senator Johnson’s and Senator Grassley’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s business dealings, from July 1, 2020 to July 1, 2021. 2. The names of the Justice Department and FBI officials who communicated with Facebook regarding Russian disinformation during the 2020 election. 3. The names of the Facebook officials who the Justice Department and FBI made contact with during the 2020 election. 4. The dates of when Facebook decreased the distribution of articles relating to Hunter Biden’s laptop

The FBI’s claim to Meta that the Hunter Biden laptop story is Russian disinformation is extremely concerning given the bureau had been in possession of the laptop since 2019.

“Either way, the FBI lied to Facebook and presumptively Twitter and many other media outlets. If the FBI had analyzed the laptop, it knew it was not Russian disinformation; if agents had not yet assessed the material, it had no basis to claim it was Russian disinformation,” wrote the Federalist’s Margot Cleveland.

Meanwhile, the FBI launched into damage control over the weekend, insisting that it “routinely” warns tech companies about “potential threat information.”

“I am stunned, outraged, and deeply saddened by the news that my friend Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, was shot and killed while campaigning,” Biden wrote in a statement appearing on the White House website.

“This is a tragedy for Japan and for all who knew him. I had the privilege to work closely with Prime Minister Abe.”

Abe was shot and killed during a campaign speech in Nara City Friday.

Biden went on to condemn the scourge of “gun violence” as being responsible for Abe’s death, despite the fact guns are almost completely banned in the island nation.

“While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it,” Biden stated.

Indeed, Japan’s strict gun laws make firearms very difficult to obtain making shooting deaths extremely rare, with only 9 deaths reported in 2018.

CNN reports: “Under Japan’s firearms laws, the only guns permitted for sale are shotguns and air rifles — handguns are outlawed. But getting them is a long and complicated process that requires effort — and lots of patience.”

However, it’s apparent even the strictest gun laws could not prevent assassin Tetsuya Yamagami from carrying out his deadly act, as it is reported he fabricated his own improvised weapon.

It appears in this case, as with almost every other shooting, the assassin’s motives and state of mind are more to blame for his violence than the gun he used; however, with the Biden administration’s war on the Second Amendment well underway, it’s impossible to let a good crisis go to waste.",Election
infowars,Election,8808,infowars,"Supporters of former president Donald Trump cried foul when social media sites owned by liberal billionaires banned all mention of the large body evidence of high-stakes international graft by his rival Joe Biden’s son Hunter.

Elon Musk’s apparent pledge to reveal internal Twitter debates on suppressing the Hunter Biden ‘Laptop from Hell’ story could have wide-reaching political repercussions, commentators say.

Musk dropped a heavy hint on the social media site on Thursday that he would publish internal company messages that led to the decision to suspend the New York Post Twitter account and block all tweets linking to the report on its website, just a month before the 2020 US presidential election that saw Joe Biden take power in Washington.

The computer, abandoned at a Delaware repair shop, contained photos of the President’s son naked with prostitutes and taking hard drugs along with incriminating emails and SMS messages implicating him at the centre of a political cash-for-influence conspiracy.

The South African tech tycoon said the action was necessary to “restore public trust” in Twitter.

But how serious is Musk about opening up on scandals at the social network he bought last month?

Tiberio Graziani, chairman for vision and global trends at the International Institute for Global Analyses, told Sputnik that the situation put Twitter’s new owner in a position of power.

Obviously, “Musk could really expose Hunter Biden’s private and secret conversations,” Graziani pointed out, “but he could also negotiate if, how and when to make them public.”

The analyst observed that the scandal was also an opportunity for Musk to stamp his mark on the site he acquired in a sharply-contested takeover, just as the US and the world could be about to witness major power shifts.

“In a particularly stormy period between the West and Russia, the intention expressed by Elon Musk to reveal the documents about Twitter’s decision to ban the Hunter Biden laptop story constitutes a good launch for ‘his’ Twitter and, indirectly, accredits the new owner of this social network as a new hero, as he dares to challenge the power group that refers to President Biden,” Graziani said.

The Twitter memos, once made public, would “become elements that the political struggle will exploit in order to influence the current presidency and, in perspective, the campaign for the 2024 presidential election,” he added.

It was not only Big Tech barons like Twitter’s Jack Dorsey and Facebook’s* Mark Zuckerberg who conspired to bury the Hunter Biden story, but also the Democratic Party, intelligence agents, the FBI and journalists, who insisted it was “Russian disinformation” designed to benefit former president Donald Trump.

The issue of so-called ‘Russian’ disinformation has been — at least since the 2016 presidential campaign — a constant in the US domestic political debate,” Graziani said. “It has become a sort of mantra, difficult to eradicate.”

Professor Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, believed Musk was serious about releasing the internal Twitter records, but “it really depends on what’s in them.”

“Why was it blocked?” he asks of the “Laptop from hell” report. “There was a political motivation to it, which I think is important to determine. And if so, that has some repercussions on our system.”

Elson said Twitter would be justified in publishing the private conversations between staff — and allowing users to post details of the material on Hunter Biden’s hard drive — as they dealt with “an act that harmed public trust by withholding it.”

“Any time you put something in writing, you can expect at some point it becomes public,” he stressed. “If it’s in writing, it may very well appear somewhere.”

Come Carpentier de Gourdon is the Convener of the Editorial Board of the World Affairs Journal, a quarterly publication dedicated to international issues, and an associate of the International Institute for Social and Economic Studies (IISES).

He told Sputnik it was apparent that Musk had decided to support Donald Trump in his bid to regain the presidency in 2024, after becoming “very politicized” by the Democrats’ liberal polices and attempts to censor information.

De Gourdon said airing the decision-making process would have “huge” support in the US. “Something like 70 percent of Americans, according to some polls, want to release the information which was withheld, according to reports, because of the intervention of the FBI.”

“I would expect Musk to release information because he likes the publicity and he likes suspense”, he added.

However, the editor does not think Musk will reveal anything new, “Given that most of that information is already publicly available on the net because of the transcript of the laptop.”

“The very principle of social media is that they can be hacked or sometimes released by anonymous sources,” de Gourdon pointed out. All Musk could present would be “data on what really happened and what reasons the FBI invoked for trying to prevent the release of the information” — and who told the federal agency to declare it “Russian disinformation.”

With the Republicans, who gained a slim majority in the House of Representatives in the November midterms, announcing an investigation into the Bidens’ dealings, the current affairs expert did not think Twitter’s potential release of more information would make a difference.

“But the volume of information available from something like 125,000 messages from the laptop, plus the number of e-mails and other documentary evidence that by itself is a very, very major problem which the Bidens will have to explain and answer for,” de Gourdon stressed.

“I’m sure he is going to be under a very heavy pressure not to reveal everything,” he said of Musk “But on the other hand, he’s obviously in contact with some Republicans. He would consider it in the interest of the Republican Party for the information [to get] out, especially if it is indeed very damaging to Biden’s family.”

“While we have made progress much more needs to be done to improve people’s lives,” Pelosi wrote. “This election is crucial: nothing less is at stake than our Democracy. But we don’t agonize, we organize. I am running for re-election to Congress to deliver For The People and defend Democracy.”

Footage of the decaying state of California was added to the background of the announcement, with Johnson titling the new clip, “Accurate Nancy Pelosi re-election video.”

As Pelosi panders to the liberal mob in the re-election declaration, viewers can see images of the poop-filled streets of San Francisco, mass looting of retail shops, heroin needles, rampant homelessness and more.

After the mock re-election video surpassed Pelosi’s original post in shares, Johnson captured it with a screenshot and posted, “LOL REKT.”

At the time of writing this article, Benny Johnson’s post has 4.5k retweets while Pelosi’s pinned video has 4.2k.

infowars,Election,5794,infowars,"The Czech Republic has become the first NATO country to deliver tanks and heavy infantry equipment to Ukraine following President Volodymyr Zelensky’s pleas for help from the West.

Over a dozen T-72 tanks, BVP-1 infantry fighting vehicles, and howitzer artillery pieces were shipped to Slovakia en route to Ukraine, broadcaster Czech Television showed.

The delivery signals a notable escalation against Russia by a NATO ally, raising the possibility that NATO could soon plunge itself into a direct military conflict with Russia despite carefully waging a proxy campaign since Russia’s incursion into Ukraine in February.

“Much more, several times more, can be done if we join forces with other allies,” said Czech Deputy Defense Minister Tomáš Kopečný.

Curiously, the shipment is not only funded by Prague, but by private donors through a crowdfunding campaign organized by the government.

Until today, NATO allies had refused to send heavy military equipment, instead opting to send anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, small arms and protective equipment, ammunition, and medical equipment to portray itself as less involved in the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

The U.S. Department of Defense has even shot down a proposal by Poland to send 28 MiG jets to Ukraine, claiming such a move would be “untenable.”

But all that changed following Ukraine’s questionable accusations of a massacre perpetrated by Russia in Bucha.

NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned Wednesday ahead of a NATO meeting in Brussels that the trans-Atlantic bloc will begin discussing other allied countries sending heavy military equipment to Ukraine, adding the conflict “could last months, even years.”

“Since the invasion allies have stepped up their support. I also expect that ministers when they meet today and tomorrow will discuss how they can further support Ukraine,” he said without providing details.

“I can say that the totality of what allies are doing is significant and that includes also some heavier systems combined with lighter systems.”

“We need also to be prepared for the long haul, both when it comes to supporting Ukraine, sustaining sanctions and strengthening our defenses,” he added.

Russia has withdrawn its forces from Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine to consolidate and regroup them in the eastern Donbas region of the country as part of its military operation’s “next phase.”

Now it appears that NATO is preparing its own phase to end its proxy campaign in favor of direct military intervention in Ukraine against a nuclear power.

Exposing the Propaganda to Isolate Russia and Ignite World War",Election
infowars,Election,7378,infowars,"Update (2053ET): Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R) came out with a blistering response to the Monday FBI raid on former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, reportedly in connection with materials Trump brought with him after leaving office.

“The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves,” said DeSantis. “Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic.”

Moments ago, Donald Trump – who is still banned by Twitter – published a statement on Truth Social in which he said that his Florida home, Mar A Lago is “currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents“, an assault which according to Trump “could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries.” He is probably right. He also claims the Fed’s presence was unannounced and the reason was politically motivated.

His full statement posted on his Truth Social account is below:

Statement by Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the These are dark times for our Nation, as my beautiful home, Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, is currently under siege, raided, and occupied by a large group of FBI agents. Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don’t want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections. Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before. They even broke into my safe! What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee? Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States. The political persecution of President Donald J. Trump has been going on for years, with the now fully debunked Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and so much more, it just never ends. It is political targeting at the highest level! Hillary Clinton was allowed to delete and acid wash 33,000 E-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable. She even took antique furniture, and other items from the White House. I stood up to America’s bureaucratic corruption, I restored power to the people, and truly delivered for our Country, like we have never seen before. The establishment hated it. Now, as they watch my endorsed candidates win big victories, and see my dominance in all polls, they are trying to stop me, and the Republican Party, once more. The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt must be exposed and stopped.



I will continue to fight for the Great American People!

Local reporters confirmed the raid, saying the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. “They just left,” although it isn’t clear what the search was about.

According to the New York Times:

The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. Mr. Trump delayed returning 15 boxes of material requested by officials with the National Archives for many months, only doing so when there became a threat of action being taken to retrieve them.

As Techno Fog notes, the politics of the search can’t be ignored. If the New York Times is to be believed, Trump’s purported crime – the delay of returning materials – could have been resolved in another manner not involving raiding his home and breaking open a personal safe. No doubt the search is an escalation by a desperate Regime confronted by their own failures at home and abroad.

This doesn’t necessarily mean there wasn’t another reason for the search. Could it have to do with the DOJ’s ongoing January 6 probe (although, given the politicization of Biden’s DOJ, that is no guarantee)? Maybe not, but it might be too soon to tell. Last week there was reporting that a federal grand jury investigating January 6 had issued subpoenas to the Trump White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone, and his top deputy, Patrick Philbin.

According to the author, it is possible that the roadmap for the DOJ comes from the January 6 Committee, “which has poured out the thin gruel of purported criminal charges against Trump, alleging he and others, including attorney John Eastman, could be charged with”:
• Obstruction of an Official Proceeding (18 USC 1512(c)(2)); and

Each of these counts, as well as the DOJ’s pursuit of Trump and his attorneys and advisors, amounts to the criminalization of politics, or as Technofog puts it, “arguments of law that might fail in the courts are now prosecutable offenses. Attempts to delay a vote count based on novel, and not corrupt, interpretations of the law can put you in prison. Issues surrounding the counting of state results or whether the Vice President can refuse to count electoral votes is a matter to be decided through the civil or political process, not through charges brought by vindictive opponents.”

The American Journal! Special LIVE Broadcast: Election Day – Media Launches Disinfo Campaign Ahead of Democrat Voter Fraud

“The American Journal” is live every weekday from 8-11 am CST.",Election
infowars,Election,7691,infowars,"White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre [KJP] told the American people during a Wednesday press conference that Joe Biden sees Trump supporters as an “extreme threat to democracy.“

“The president thinks there’s an extremist threat to our democracy. The president has been clear as he can be on that particular piece when we talk about our democracy, when we talk about our freedoms,” Jean-Pierre said. “The way he sees it is the MAGA Republicans are the most energized part of the Republican party. This is an extreme threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.”

Continuing, the press secretary laughably said, “They [MAGA Republicans] just don’t respect the rule of law. You’ve heard that from the president and they are pursuing an agenda that takes away people’s rights, which is what the president said last week, you all heard him. This is what the president said yesterday and that’s what he’s going to continue to say. The president is not going to shy away to call out what he clearly sees is happening in this country. Again, MAGA Republicans are this extreme part of their party and that is just facts.”

Later during the Wednesday press conference, Jean-Pierre named several GOP politicians and claimed they publicly support violence.

Each instance KJP referred to was either extremely exaggerated or outright false.

After calling tens of millions of American voters violent extremists, the White House Press Secretary dodged a question from a reporter about how Biden would differentiate “ultra MAGA” folks from the average GOP voter, suddenly saying she “can’t talk about voters from here.”

The Democrat Party is consistently choosing to promote the narrative that Republican voters and politicians are the enemy of Democrat voters as Joe Biden also called GOP voters “semi-fascists” last week.

The current chair of the Democratic National Committee Jaime Harrison defended the comments on CBS News this week.

The clearly divisive and hypocritical rhetoric was slammed online.

Breitbart podcast host Joel Pollack called on Jean-Pierre to “resign” for the “inflammatory message.”

The Media Research Center sarcastically asked, “Does Joe Biden recognize the rule of law for his son, Hunter?”

infowars,Election,7268,infowars,"The Swedish government has proposed lowering the age threshold for changing one’s legal gender in the population register from 18 to 16.

The suggestion is part of the referral to the Legislative Council concerning a new gender identity law.

The current gender identity law, introduced some 50 years ago, was the first of its kind in the world, and its replacement has long been discussed and requested by LGBT organizations as well as several parliamentary parties.

Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren emphasized that the novel approach distinguishes between the legal and the medical sphere.

“It is one thing to change legal gender, and we make the assessment in favor of lowering the age limit from 18 to 16 years. When we, on the other hand, talk about medical sex, which is preceded by gender-affirming treatments and medical interventions, the age limit remains,” Lena Hallengren told Swedish Radio.

However, the new approach facilitates making medical changes easier as well. According to the new bill, it will be up to the health and medical services to allow gender-affirming surgery, whereas permits from the National Board of Health and Welfare will no longer be required.

“The question is that healthcare is to assess which treatment is best. Not politics,” Hallengren told Swedish Radio.

The novel proposal has been toned down in comparison to last year’s proposal, in which the government wanted to make it possible for children to apply for a new legal gender in the population register starting from the age of 12.

The Swedish parliament is currently on vacation and expects the Legislative Council to take a position on the bill only after the general election this coming fall.On social media, the proposal has raised eyebrows.

“This is just weird. As a 16-year-old, you will be allowed to change your legal gender but not buy snuff or cigarettes? Not saying one is better than the other, just that it’s weird,” one user wrote.

Others accused the governing Social Democrats of seducing voters ahead of the coming election.

“The socialists are buying votes from the alphabet soup. Just before the election, there will be a lot of this to different groups in the next few months. Don’t buy into it,” another user said.

Sweden has long been celebrated across the Western world for having some of the most liberal LGBT laws. Polls have consistently suggested that an overwhelming majority of Swedes (well over 90 percent) are in favor of LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. LGBT ideology has been supported by all major institutions, ranging from the government and the authorities to the church and the military.

After legalizing homosexual activity in 1944, Sweden became the first country in the world to allow transgender people to change their legal gender following reassignment surgery in 1972, simultaneously declassifying transvestism as an illness. Legal gender change without matching hormone replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgery was allowed in 2013.

However, as the number of adolescents undergoing sex reassignment procedures has shot through the roof across Scandinavia in recent years, doctors have been ringing the alarm bells about a growing number of so-called “regretters” who, plagued by problems that may have only been temporary, opted for irreversible treatment and are left badly disfigured and mentally anguished, sometimes to the point of suicide.

The desire for sex change has been particularly evident among adolescent girls, with the number of patients diagnosed with “gender dysphoria” soaring by more than an order of magnitude within a decade.

infowars,Election,5913,infowars,"Joe Biden’s managed to break a record – for lowest approval rating of anyone ever elected, CNN polling analyst Harry Enten said Friday.

Examining numbers from several different pollsters, Enten showed how Biden’s approval ratings are in the gutter in nearly every major poll.

“They range from the low 30s to the low 40s. Low 40s is not good, either. But what’s key is the lowest are tied for the low for the pollster, lowest here, lowest here. This is one point off the lowest, lowest here,” Enten described pointing at the numbers on a screen.

“And when you have three or four pollsters showing the lowest numbers for the president of the United States, that is indicative of a president who is in a lot of trouble, at least to where he is standing historically.”

Enten went on to remind viewers the network frequently criticized Donald Trump over his low approval ratings; but at this point in his presidency, Biden’s approval is now lower than Trump’s.

“Well, at this point in his presidency, Donald Trump’s numbers, actually his average approval rating is one point higher than Joe Biden’s, which is at forty one percent,” Enten said. “Donald Trump at 42 percent, a first term president at this point in his presidency. This is the lowest. This is the lowest for anyone who is elected to the presidency and didn’t get up there through the vice presidency. This is a really, really, really bad number.”

While CNN appears surprised to see the poll results, there are several explanations for the low approval numbers, not to mention inflation, high gas prices, the disastrous Afghanistan pullout, the economy-destroying Covid restrictions and more.

infowars,Immigration,9109,infowars,"In the latest Project Veritas video exposing the invasion of America’s southern border, a teenager who illegally entered the country described being held captive by cartel members who threatened his family if he didn’t pay them.

The footage, posted Tuesday, shows an 18-year-old Spanish-speaking boy named Eduin telling Veritas reporter RC Maxwell how the criminals hold illegal immigrants hostage and shake them down for payments.

Upon entering America, the teen and his group received a WhatsApp message telling them to meet a group of men near Eagle Pass, Texas.

It was then that Eduin was taken to a stash house where other migrants were being held for ransom.

“They [cartel] were taking people out of the room one by one and we didn’t know where they were taking them because we were locked in a room that we couldn’t get out and that was the moment I started to worry,” explained the teenage alien. “They told me that they were part of a cartel and they moved people. That I had to pay the amount they asked for and if I or my family didn’t pay, I would have a bad time.”

The boy’s aunt told Veritas she was contacted by the cartel and they told her if she didn’t pay the money, she wouldn’t ever see Eduin again.

“Eduin called me crying asking me to help him,” she said. “To pay the money. The only words I told him that day was that God would help him and that I didn’t have any more money and the money I did have was already sent.”

At one point, Eduin saw an open gate in front of the stash house he was being held in and made a run for it.

“I noticed the fence was slightly open. I decided at that moment to run,” he explained. “I didn’t want to walk or run on the street where they could find me. So I hid in that barbecue pit. I didn’t know what to think in that moment, I was very scared….I turned on my phone and called my aunt and told her I escaped and I need her help.”

Maxwell also talked with a retired Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent named Harry Jimenez who said the coyotes extort money from incoming illegals all the time.

Jimenez claims Homeland Security “have been basically told ‘do not conduct any proactive investigations’…so we basically don’t know how many incidents of extortion are happening.”

According to Project Veritas, a San Antonio Police report from the day law enforcement interacted with Eduin after his escape shows the department has videos of a person being abused in what appears to be the same house he was held in by one of the same men who captured him.

This story comes as the Biden administration and mainstream media team up to gaslight the American people into thinking the illegal immigrant invasion is the GOP’s fault for warning the border is wide open.

infowars,Immigration,8169,infowars,"With less than 34 days until the 2022 midterm elections, leftists at MSNBC are still struggling to figure out why Latino voters are fleeing the party in worrying numbers.

In a recent report, MSNBC lamented how “Latino voters are shifting their focus to the issues instead of sticking with one political party.”

The number one issue for Latinos, according to a recent NBC/Telemundo survey: Cost of living, in other words, inflation and the economy.

“We see that prices are through the roof,” one Latina voter in Phoenix, Arizona, told an MSNBC correspondent. “And we want to know what people are going to do to put that burden down.”

A Latino woman in El Paso, Texas, told the reporter she switched parties because Democrats are unrecognizable from what they once were, saying, “The Democratic party has changed a lot, and I identify with the Republican party.”

Asked what she likes about the GOP, the voter said, “Well, we’re for God, country, family and hard work.”

The woman’s husband, who was also once a Democrat voter, said he’s deeply concerned about immigration, border security, and his family’s safety.

“The fact of the matter is we don’t feel safe anymore,” he stated.

In another MSNBC segment, pollster Steve Kornacki pointed out how polls reflect Latinos’ concerns over immigration and border security, with many saying they’re confident Republicans can tackle the issues.

MSNBC reporter Yasmin Vossoughian attempted to justify the numbers by admitting the Democrat party is ignoring the Latino voter bloc and simply isn’t conducting enough outreach.

MSNBC’s latest report comes on the heels of another exposé where they sent reporter Paola Ramos to Texas’ 34th congressional district to try to understand why voters in the primarily Hispanic region were switching parties.

“We were already conservative. We were already with conservative values, it’s just that nobody noticed. They took us for granted,” one man responded.

“The Democratic party left me, I didn’t leave the party,” he added.

“We are not to be taken advantage of,” another Latino voter stated. “We are not to be assumed that because we’re Hispanic we’re naturally going to vote Democratic.”

It’s quite hilarious that, despite voters detailing exactly what they dislike about Democrats, MSNBC still can’t grasp why they’re hemorrhaging voters. This should all make for a very interesting midterm election.",Immigration
infowars,Immigration,5050,infowars,"Over a million Canadians, including a massive convoy of truckers, are on their way to the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over his COVID tyranny, according to reports and video.

Former Canary Flames hockey player Theo Fleury joined Fox News’ “Ingraham Angle” on Tuesday to announce that millions of Canadians are marching to Canada’s capital to demand that Trudeau either resign or lift all the tyrannical COVID mandates.

“Right now in Canada we have one of the biggest revolutions happening, and you probably haven’t heard about it because no one’s talking about it,” Fleury told host Laura Ingraham, referring to the mainstream media.

“But right now there’s 50,000 truckers and about 1.4 million people headed to the parliament in Ottawa, and they’re going to stay there until Trudeau resigns or they give us back all our freedoms and rights.”

“For the past two years, we’ve had a prime minister who has vaccine derangement syndrome,” he continued, “where every day he stands up at the stump and that’s all he talks about. He doesn’t talk about the economy, he doesn’t talk about the supply chain, he doesn’t talk about us losing our rights, lockdowns, nothing. It’s just straight vaccines.”

Fleury insisted Canadians have become unified on a level previously unseen in their contempt for Trudeau and his draconian COVID policies they’re suffering under.

“What we’re seeing in the country right now with these truckers, honestly, it has ignited the whole entire country of Canada,” Fleury said. “Even I, a big tough hockey player have shed a few tears because I haven’t seen my country this behind something and this excited about something in a very, very long time.”

Videos over the last few days appear to confirm Fleury’s claims, showing thousands of Canadians braving the cold and snow holding Canadian flags as they march to the Parliament of Canada.

The anti-vaccine mandate trucker convoy launched last week in response to Trudeau ordering American and Canadian drivers to be fully vaccinated to cross Canada’s border by January 22.

The Canadian Trucking Alliance and the American Trucking Associations said Trudeau’s order would sideline up to 26,000 of the 160,000 drivers on the road in the middle of winter and amid unprecedented supply chain breakdowns.

Numerous videos from the Canadian border and on through Ottawa show the massive scale of the trucker convoy protesting Trudeau’s draconian vaccine mandate, which reportedly extends over 70km.

“To our fellow Canadians, the time for political overreach is over,” the Freedom Convoy GoFundMe page says. “Our current government is implementing rules and mandates that are destroying the foundation of our businesses, industries and livelihoods.”

Ontario politician Randy Hillier called Canada’s Transport Minister Omar Alghabra a “terrorist” on Twitter for calling the cross-border trucker vaccine mandate the “solution” to the supply chain disruptions, prompting Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino to call on Twitter to censor him.

Supermarkets in the country have already been reporting “food shortages” as a result of the cross-border trucker vaccine mandate,

The trucker convoy will reportedly converge with the bulk of the protesters in Ottawa on January 29.

infowars,Immigration,7099,infowars,"Texas Senator Ted Cruz (R) vowed to take action against Joe Biden’s DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas when Republicans take back Congress in the midterms.

In a Friday interview on Fox News’ “Hannity,” Cruz laid out how the Biden administration’s immigration policies have led to the collapse of the southern border and a wave of humanitarian catastrophes brought on by cartels trafficking humans and drugs.

“You know, on the banks of the Rio Grande just in the grass, you found wristbands which I found on the ground here, a couple of white ones. Here’s a pink one, here’s a green one, and they’re all color-coded. This is a yellow one,” Cruz said, holding up recovered wristbands.

“All of these are color coded for how many thousands of dollars the people wearing them owe the cartels. This yellow one is tiny. This was obviously worn by a child, it’s not broken the child’s hand was small enough to slip it off without it. This is a little child, a little girl, a little boy who is now in America and finds herself or himself owing drug cartels thousands of dollars.”

“And what happens next is that these kids the Biden administration ships them to every city in America, even if you don’t live on the southern border, you’re in a border town because there are kids in your town, there are 14, 15, 16 year old boys who owe the drug cartels thousands of dollars. They’re working for the drug cartels, committing crimes in your town,” he pointed out.

The Texas senator listed off the terrible toll of human life taken as a result of Biden’s open-border policies.

“And I got to say, Sean, the body bags are piling up,” Cruz said. “We saw just a few weeks ago, over 50 illegal immigrants in a tractor-trailer outside of San Antonio die of heat exposure, including kids as young as 13. Last year, we had a hundred thousand people die of drug overdoses with this fentanyl exposure explosion and the Joe Biden body bags keep getting worse and worse and worse.”

Cruz then pledged that Republicans will brings articles of impeachment against Mayorkas for facilitating the illegal human trafficking and compromising America’s sovereignty.

“I think November is going to be a red tidal wave. I think South Texas is going to turn red,” Cruz said. “And if and when Republicans retake Congress, I believe one of the very first priorities is that we should impeach Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.”

“I think the House will do that and the Senate needs to conduct a trial. We need to put on a trial and put on the evidence of the people that are suffering and dying as a result of Joe Biden’s dereliction of duty,” Cruz added.

In the meantime, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) last week granted the National Guard and Department of Public Safety the power to detain immigrants who illegally enter the U.S. between ports of entry and return them to the border.

“While President Biden refuses to do his job and enforce the immigration laws enacted by Congress, the State of Texas is once again stepping up and taking unprecedented action to protect Americans and secure our southern border,” Abbott said last Thursday.

Texas Set To Declare War Time Authority To Stop Collapse Of Border",Immigration
infowars,Immigration,5888,infowars,"With Texas being flooded by illegal immigrants, the state’s Republican Governor Greg Abbott recently decided to pull a political stunt by sending busloads of the criminals to the swamp known as Washington, DC.

On Wednesday, the first busload of illegal aliens arrived in the nation’s capital with help from The Texas Division of Emergency Management under orders from Abbott.

The migrants, who were previously being held at the Del Rio Border Patrol Sector, came from nations like Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela.

Governor Abbott touched on the scheme in a recent statement, writing, “As the federal government continues to turn a blind eye to the border crisis, the State of Texas will remain steadfast in our efforts to fill in the gaps and keep Texans safe. By busing migrants to Washington, D.C., the Biden Administration will be able to more immediately meet the needs of the people they are allowing to cross our border. Texas should not have to bear the burden of the Biden Administration’s failure to secure our border.”

“We are taking them to the United States Capitol where the Biden Administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border,” the governor told reporters on Wednesday.

While the stunt is promoted as a humorous slamming of the left, it does not solve the root issue and may actually be illegal.

Obviously, the federal government is not following the law by allowing an estimated 18,000 illegal immigrants into the country each day, but is Abbott’s response actually helping?

According to Section 274(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (I.N.A.), it is illegal to move or attempt to transport or move illegal aliens within the United States by means of transportation or otherwise.

Prosecutors looking to convict someone under that law would have to prove the person or party involved transported or attempted to transport an illegal noncitizen within the U.S. while knowing they were in the country illegally.

Punishment for violating this immigration law is delivered “for each alien in respect to whom such a violation occurs.”

The answer to the illegal immigration crisis isn’t violating the law in response to the federal government violating the law: the solution is enforcing the US Constitution and laws already on the books.",Immigration

“…given Canada’s support of Ukraine… I don’t know it it’s far-fetched to ask but there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows… perhaps even instigating it…”

As Brian Lilley writes at The Toronto Sun, “the media in this country is not acting as a neutral observer and conduit for news on this matter, most have decided the trucker convoy is the enemy and are treating it as such. Watch any of the news networks or, more importantly, read the Twitter accounts of supposedly objective journalists, or listen to the contempt in their voices as they ask questions to see that they have clearly taken sides.”

The propaganda seems to have reached some, but not others…

In other news, while Trudeau hides in isolation, the Premier of Saskatchewan, a Canadian province that borders the US, calls for an end of the cross-border ban on unvaccinated truckers.

The world’s largest truck convoy rolled into Canada’s capital, Ottawa, late Friday night and continues today to stage a protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cross-border vaccine mandates (or as some call it: medical tyranny).

The so-called “Freedom Convoy” – coming from all corners of Canada and even the US, has been traveling all week and is leading the charge in a massive demonstration against government overreach. Truckers from around the world are uniting and staging protests of their own.

As Enrico Trigoso reports at The Epoch Times, Brian Von D, the administrator at “Convoy to DC 2022” announced that they will “join forces” to ride from California to Washington, adding that “America is next.”

He added that dates and planned routes would be released soon on a website and various social media platforms, and a GoFundMe page would only be released on their CONVOY TO DC 2022 Facebook page.

The Parliamentary Protective Service expects as many as 10,000 protesters this weekend in Ottawa, but that figure could be significantly higher. A day ago, we noted 50,000 trucks in a 70km (43.5 miles) long convoy are headed to the capital.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the Freedom Convoy is “the largest parade of trucks” ever in the world.

The trucker convoy has been arriving in the capital for the past 12 hours. Additional waves of the convoy will arrive later this afternoon.

Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau called the convoy a “small fringe minority” of those who “do not represent the views of Canadians.” Judging by the pictures and videos so far, Trudeau is a liar, and a revolt is underway in the country. Corporate media and government have spent the better part of the week downplaying the convoy ( because they are scared).

On Friday, Trudeau told the Canadian Press that he was worried about the protest turning violent. Organizers of the event have told truckers and anyone else participating in the demonstration to remain peaceful.

CBC said Trudeau and his family left downtown Ottawa on Saturday morning (due to close contact with someone infected with COVID – although he tested negative and triple-jabbed) as the trucker convoy descended on the area. The local news said he left town due to security concerns.

The convoy is expected to bring parts of the metro area to a standstill and block roads in front of parliament until lawmakers repeal a vaccine mandate for truckers hauling freight across the border.

Despite Trudeau calling the protest “small,” Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly said they planned a “massive” demonstration on Friday.",Immigration

Greg Abbott (R) continues dispersing record-breaking numbers of border crossers and illegal aliens arriving in his state to Democrat-run “sanctuary cities.”

New York City officials appeared to be unprepared for the migrants’ arrival, or at least lacked communication and coordination to receive them, as Port Authority did not initially have a gate for the bus to park, and Port Authority employees were not aware of the plan for arrival. The bus circled between 8th and 9th avenues Friday morning until it was finally able to park at Gate 14 at approximately 7:30 a.m.

“Because of President Biden’s continued refusal to acknowledge the crisis caused by his open border policies, the State of Texas has had to take unprecedented action to keep our communities safe,” Gov. Abbott said in a statement.

“In addition to Washington, D.C., New York City is the ideal destination for these migrants, who can receive the abundance of city services and housing that Mayor Eric Adams has boasted about within the sanctuary city,” Abbott said. “I hope he follows through on his promise of welcoming all migrants with open arms so that our overrun and overwhelmed border towns can find relief.”",Immigration
infowars,Immigration,6433,infowars,"According to a recent FBI search-warrant application unsealed this week in the Southern District of Ohio, an ISIS terrorist planned on assassinating the globalist puppet president George W. Bush.

A pair of confidential informants and monitoring of the terrorist’s WhatsApp messages by the agency lead to the foiling of the plot.

“An Iraqi citizen living in Columbus, Ohio, has been charged federally with an immigration crime and with aiding and abetting a plot to murder former United States President George W. Bush,” a Justice Department press release stated.

In November, the individual plotting to kill Bush allegedly went to Dallas, Texas to film the former president’s house in preparation for the assassination.

While the man’s defense is trying to argue the FBI entrapped him, the fact that he followed through with filming Bush’s residence will not help his case.

An FBI informant did drive the suspect to Dallas for the surveillance mission.

The Columbus, Ohio man, 52-year-old Shihab Ahmed Shihab Shihab, was upset at Bush for destroying the country of Iraq and killing hundreds of thousands of its citizens in the 2003 invasion and following years.

Bush made headlines last week after he accidentally said, “Iraq” when referring to Putin’s “brutal invasion” of Ukraine.

After smuggling his co-conspirators into the country, Shihab allegedly wished to have them sneak back out through the Southern border.

During FBI surveillance, the agency allegedly captured audio of Shihab admitting he charged two individuals associated with the terrorist group Hezbollah $50,000 to be smuggled into America.

It’s unknown if the FBI is trailing these supposed Hezbollah terrorist members or if they have been apprehended.

Texas GOP Senator Ted Cruz pointed out the report “puts it in the absolute starkest terms the necessity to secure the border NOW.”

Did America sign off on these alleged strikes? Did they feed Ukraine the intelligence? Was this a deliberate provocation by the US or did the Ukrainian military stage it to try and draw the US even further into the war?

From RT, “Oil depot on fire in Russian region bordering Ukraine”:

A fire broke out on Monday morning at an oil depot in Bryansk, a large Russian city around 150km from Ukraine, and 370km south-west of Moscow. The blaze occurred at a premises operated by Transneft-Druzhba JSC and at another location, officials told RIA Novosti. No casualties have been reported and there is no threat to residential buildings, the Ministry of Emergency Situations has advised. “The evacuation of the population is not planned. According to preliminary information, there were no victims,” its press service stated, according to TASS. Local residents have reported that explosions were heard and sirens are audible in social media videos. Another fire was recorded in the Fokinsky district of the city, the causes of which have not yet been established, Moscow daily Kommersant has reported. Bryansk is home to over 400,000 people, and is an important regional hub.

Russia responded by carrying out strikes on at least five Ukrainian railway stations in central and western Ukraine, with the goal of trying to cut off the US’s weapons shipments.

The Asia Times reported last week that “US involvement goes deeper than arms sales and intelligence sharing.”

A Pentagon official who requested anonymity told me it is “likely we have a limited footprint on the ground in Ukraine, but under Title 50, not Title 10,” meaning US intelligence operatives and paramilitaries – but not regular military. Bruce Fein, a constitutional expert and former associate attorney general in the Ronald Reagan administration, told me this week that in his view, “the United States and several NATO members have become co-belligerents with Ukraine against Russia by systematic and massive assistance to its military forces to defeat Russia.” According to Fein, the US and its NATO allies are now vulnerable to attack by “an enemy belligerent,” meaning Russia, because of their “systematic or substantial violations of a neutral’s duties of impartiality and non-participation in the conflict.” “Neutrality,” continued Fein, “is violated by permitting a belligerent to violate its territorial integrity (as Belarus and Russia have done to Ukraine), or by supplying warships, arms, ammunition, military provisions or other war materials, directly or indirectly, or supplying military advisers to a belligerent,” as the US has done. “Under the Declare War Clause of the constitution, co-belligerency, which displaces the status of the United States as neutral, requires a declaration of war by Congress,” said Fein. But instead of fulfilling its constitutional duties, Congress has been aggressively pushing the administration to deepen its involvement in what is clearly now a US-Russian proxy war. On. March 2, the US House of Representatives voted 425-3 in favor of a non-binding resolution “Supporting the People of Ukraine.” The following week, on March 10, the House overwhelmingly voted to send $14 billion in military funding to Ukraine as part of an omnibus spending package. And on April 7, the US Senate passed Republican Senator John Cornyn’s Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which “temporarily waives certain requirements related to the President’s authority to lend or lease defense articles if the defense articles are intended for Ukraine’s government and necessary to protect civilians in Ukraine from Russian military invasion.” In the end, Congress and the Biden administration are wading into dangerous waters. Fein warns that the US has “employed the concept of co-belligerency to target for extermination any group or individual who provides material support to al-Qaeda or ISIS” – and there is a real risk that Russia may take a page out of America’s playbook.

In a Facebook post, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine has agreed to talks with Russia on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

“We have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with Russian without prior conditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, in the area of the Pripyat River,” Zelenskiy said. A delegation has already left Kyiv, Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of Zelenskiy’s party, said in televised comments.

The Ukraine foreign minister said that he will go to listen to what Russia has to say and that he will not surrender territory.

The confirmation came after Russia earlier sent a negotiation team to the southeastern Belarusian city of Gomel. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the “Russian delegation is ready for talks, and we are now waiting for the Ukrainians” in the Belarusian city of Homel, per AP.

In response, Zelensky said in a video address that he’s open to talks, but not in Belarus which he said was not neutral territory.

“If there had been no aggressive action from your territory, we could talk in Minsk … other cities can be used as the venue for talks,” Zelensky said. “We want peace, we want to meet, we want an end to the war,” he added. “Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku — we proposed all that to the Russian side. Any other city would work for us, too, in a country from whose territory rockets are not being fired.”

While an encouraging development, this won’t be the first time that the two nations have exchanged proposals for a potential ceasefire, only to see the plans collapse.

infowars,Immigration,6410,infowars,"A federal judge has halted President Joe Biden’s plan to end Title 42, ordering federal agencies to continue the program because the termination order likely violates federal law.

The decision is a win for President Joe Biden — but is also a win for the opponents of Biden’s easy migration policy.

Biden wins because he can keep using Title 42 to manage the migrant inflow. Without Title 42, many more migrants would rush the border, forcing TV news executives to broadcast dramatic videos on the evening news. Also, he can blame the judge when his pro-migration allies want to blame someone for the Title 42 barrier.

Pro-American groups also won because they keep the last remaining curbs on the inflow of migrants invited to the U.S. border by Biden and his pro-migration border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas. Each Month, Mayorkas is pressured to exclude one-third of the new migrants into the United States.

In April, Mayorkas exempted 137,000 migrants from Title 42 and allowed them to enter the United States, out of the 235,000 who were recorded at the border. But he also allowed roughly 60,000 more migrants to sneak across the border. So just 138,000 were excluded — and many of those will try again in May because Mayorkas flies very few of them back to their distant homelands.

Mayorkas planned to stop enforcing the barrier on Monday, May 23. But the judge’s decision does not bar Mayorkas from exempting many migrants from the Title 42 barrier.",Immigration
infowars,Immigration,7974,infowars,"The Democrat sheriff of Bexar County in Texas who claims to be criminally investigating Florida governor Ron DeSantis admitted Tuesday that assertions made by Biden officials that the border is secure are patently false.

As we highlighted yesterday, Javier Salazar announced that he has opened an investigation into DeSantis sending migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, prompting DeSantis and his office to respond that “Immigrants have been more than willing to leave Bexar County after being abandoned, homeless, and ‘left to fend for themselves.’ Florida gave them an opportunity to seek greener pastures in a sanctuary jurisdiction that offered greater resources for them, as we expected.”

DeSantis himself pointed out that no one seemed all that bothered when more than 50 migrants were found dead in a trailer in Bexar County itself.

One thing DeSantis and Salazar can agree on, however, is that calling the border ‘secure’ is an outright lie.

Appearing on CNN, Salazar commented “I don’t think that the border is as secure as the folks in D.C. might believe,” adding that “if the White House came down and got an eye on Texas and saw firsthand, which is what I’ve been asking them to do for a while, come down here and get an eye on the problem, I would beg to differ.”

“I don’t think that the border is as secure as what folks are maybe telling them,” the sheriff continued, adding “I think there’s some solutions to be had, but it’s going to start with somebody from D.C. making the trip down here and talking to us.”

Salazar was responding to comments made last week by Kamala Harris:

New Customs and Border Protection data shows record levels of encounters with undocumented migrants at the border:

Democratic Senator Joe Manchin also described Harris’ remarks as “dead wrong” further stating “we need the wall and a lot more, technology, more agents.”

According to the data from CBP, more than two million people have attempted to cross the border in the 2022 fiscal year so far.

A recent NPR/Ipsos poll has revealed that over 50 percent of Americans feel that the southern border is under ‘invasion’ from illegal immigrants.

Raul Ortiz, The Head of The U.S. Border Patrol has also testified under oath that he believes the Biden administration’s policy of “no consequences” for illegal immigrants trying to enter the country has made the border less safe, caused an exponential increase in people attempting to cross, and has directly caused what he believes constitutes a “crisis”.

Border Patrol agents recently described White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre as “extremely dumb” following her claims that migrants are not “walking across” the southern border.

The Border Patrol are being told to literally unlock gates for illegal immigrants to walk into the country and get bussed to cities like New York.

infowars,Police,8155,infowars,"Philadelphia has been plunged into chaos as armed criminals rampage through the city, carrying out brazen carjackings, robberies, and murders.

Video after video posted on social media display virtually unchecked criminality in the City of Brotherly Love.

On Saturday night, armed thugs piled out of a van and chased victims around a gas station before stealing at least one car and robbing the business, according to reports.

“Offenders armed with RIFLES carjacke[d] an innocent driver AND robbed the gas station,” Twitter user PhillyCrimeUpdate explained in a post including surveillance footage of the harrowing incident.

On the same night, street racers and hooligans took over multiple intersections and began performing dangerous stunts as crowds gathered.

Also on Saturday, a group of students from Temple University were reportedly robbed at gunpoint by three suspects.

“A gunman placed a gun to a students head and robbed the entire group of their belongings,” PhillyCrimeUpdate reported, citing police sources.

Footage of another carjacking at a Philadelphia home surfaced last week.

A woman was preparing to take her daughter to school at around 6:15 a.m. on September 19 when a black male suspect wearing a mask ran into their driveway, pointed a pistol at both victims, and then drove off in their vehicle.

“Amir Harvey, 20, of Philadelphia, PA was arrested and charged by Criminal Complaint with carjacking and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in connection with a carjacking incident which occurred in Northeast Philadelphia earlier this month,” Breaking911 reported.

The country has seen multiple unruly demonstrations across the nation in response to the government’s plan to cut nitrogen emissions by up to 95% by 2030.

Farmers say the policy will lead to at least 30% of Dutch farms being put out of business as they’re forced to cut the number of livestock by the same figure.

Anger has intensified after the government revealed the same nitrogen cuts, being proposed in the name of fighting climate change, won’t be applied to the airline industry.

The incident unfolded last night during a confrontation which took place in the northern town of Heerenveen.

Video footage shows officers shooting at a tractor which they claimed was trying to evade law enforcement.

Authorities claimed “tractor drivers attempted to drive into officers and service vehicles,” adding, “A threatening situation arose. Warning shots were fired and targeted shots were fired.”

The tractor was hit and the three suspects were arrested, with no injuries having occurred.

Video of the incident does not show the tractor attempting to “drive into officers.”

One of the suspects shot at by police was a 16-year-old boy.

The National Criminal Investigation Department has launched an official inquiry into the incident.

Farmers have also purchased a tank which they are using to blockade distribution centers as a reminder to the public about what will happen if food supplies are drastically impacted by globalist climate change policies.

“Fisherman in the country have also begun blocking ports in solidarity with the farmers,” reports Zero Hedge.

Farmers have also protested by pouring manure on government offices and outside the homes of ministers.

The shooting in Heerenveen is sure to be another flashpoint for further unrest.

Government attempts to impose their green agenda on farmers has led to a rash of suicides, with three farmers killing themselves in the last two weeks alone.

infowars,Police,8576,infowars,"A known gang member is facing a slew of charges after he plowed into a police cruiser at the scene of a prior fatal crash and then led officers on a high-speed chase in Connecticut last week, according to reports.

The shocking series of events unfolded at around 8:45 p.m. on November 1 in Waterbury, a city in New Haven County.

Authorities had taped off an intersection where a male pedestrian had been struck and killed roughly 90 minutes prior when a car drove into the secured area and nearly hit investigators.

Officers sprinted toward the vehicle and ordered the driver out, but he ignored them, throwing the car into reverse and slamming into a patrol SUV and another vehicle parked at the scene.

The suspect then fled and led officers on a high-speed chase while tossing items out of the windows, including narcotics.

The pursuit came to an end when the suspect crashed into an apartment building where he was residing and ran inside, where he was arrested.

Waterbury Police Chief Fernando C. Spagnolo later identified the suspect as 35-year-old Myrice Hodge, a gang member with a lengthy rap sheet and an outstanding warrant for a domestic incident.

“Police said officers recovered a total of 21 bundles of heroin that had been in Hodge’s possession,” CT Insider reports.

“Hodge is a known member of the Crips gang, Spagnolo said. He described Hodge as a ‘convicted felon that has ties with guns, drugs and gangs.’ Police said Hodge has a criminal history in Connecticut and New York dating back to 2004.”

Hodge was charged with two counts of first-degree criminal attempted assault, seven counts of first-degree reckless endangerment, two counts of evading responsibility, engaging police in a pursuit, possession of narcotics with intent to sell, and motor vehicle-related offenses, along with charges related to the warrant, authorities say.

An investigation and legal proceedings are ongoing.

infowars,Police,6524,infowars,"The Ukrainian Parliament’s Human Rights Commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, was removed from her position on Tuesday after 234 politicians voted for her dismissal.

Politico reporter Christopher Miller wrote on Twitter, “Ukraine’s parliament just fired human rights ombudsman Lyudmila Denisova. MPs claimed her work focusing on the rape of Ukrainians by Russian troops which ‘couldn’t be confirmed with evidence […] only harmed Ukraine and distracted the global media from Ukraine’s real needs.'”

Ukrainian news website ukrinform.com reports, “The reasons for Denisova’s dismissal were as follows: the repeated failure to perform her duties related to the establishment of humanitarian corridors, protection and swap of prisoners, counteracting the deportation of adults and children from the occupied territories, other human right activities; focusing the ombudsman’s media activity on the numerous details of ‘unnatural sexual offences’ and child sexual abuses in the occupied territories, which were unsupported by evidence and only harmed Ukraine.”

In addition to spending too much time focusing on alleged sex crimes that she ultimately couldn’t prove with evidence, Denisova was also criticized for spending time in “warm Western Europe” instead of in Russia or Belarus where she could “help prisoners, deportees and victims.”

As the Ukrainian politician is fired for failing to prove Russian soldiers are raping citizens, Western media is being flooded with reports of these heinous crimes taking place.

Liudmyla Denisova played a large role in the spreading of rape claims coming out of Ukraine, claiming last month the Ukrainian government received “more than 400 allegations of sexual violence, including rape, of Ukrainians by Russian soldiers in the space of two weeks.”

In the Ukrainian Parliament’s appeal to Denisova’s position as Human Rights Commissioner, the politicians accused her of looking to spread “scandalous” stories to news outlets instead of drawing attention to “the facts of crimes.”

According to hromadske.ua, the appeal reads, “Sexual crimes during the war are family tragedies, a difficult traumatic topic, not a topic for publications in the spirit of the ‘scandalous chronicle.’ We need to keep in mind the goal: to draw attention to the facts of crimes.”

While Denisova is being fired for failing to prove any cases of a Russian troop raping a Ukrainian citizen, the first trial for such a crime is just beginning.

In a bizarre story, a Russian soldier named Mikhail Romanov is accused of murdering a man and raping his wife in the Kyiv region of Ukraine.

Romanov is being charged for the alleged crimes despite authorities not knowing where he is or if he’s even alive.

“Even though the accused is not currently in our hands, he will not escape a fair trial and accountability before the law,” Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said.

Since the suspect hasn’t been apprehended, a random Russian soldier who was said to have been part of a tank division that attacked towns and villages around Kyiv will be tried in his absence.

Even Yahoo News admitted, “Any conviction would likely be symbolic as Ukraine never captured Romanov.”

Yahoo also explained, “The account matches a previous incident described by prosecutors in March, which at the time was still under investigation. No suspect was named in the earlier account.”

So, Ukraine’s top human rights official has been fired for her lack of proof of rapes by Russian soldiers, and the first trial of a Russian soldier raping a citizen is a “symbolic” gesture regarding an unconfirmed incident.

This information will not prevent average citizens, the American media or establishment politicians in both political parties from regurgitating the unconfirmed claims of Russian troops raping people en masse.",Police
infowars,Police,8881,infowars,"A new study published in the American Journal of Public Health revealed the number of law-abiding Americans carrying a loaded handgun daily nearly doubled between 2015-19.

The study titled “Trend in Loaded Handgun Carrying Among Adult Handgun Owners in the United States, 2015‒2019” found the number of law-abiding US adults carrying handguns nearly doubled from 9 million in 2015 to 16 million in 2019.

“Proportionally fewer handgun owners carried handguns in states where issuing authorities had substantial discretion in granting permits,” the study’s authors said.

The authors claimed that very “little was known about the frequency and features of firearm carrying among adult handgun owners in the United States before this study. In fact, over the past 30 years, only a few peer-reviewed national surveys, conducted in 1994,1995, 1996, and 2015, have provided even the most basic information about firearm carrying frequency.”

Research firm Ipsos conducted the national survey between July 2019 and August 2019. Respondents were from firearm-owning households drawn from Ipsos’s Knowledge Panel, an online sampling pool of approximately 55,000 adults.

There was no explanation by the study’s authors for the rapid increase in daily handgun-carrying adults. But during the period, social unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore City, Maryland, as well as surging violent crime across certain metro areas, could be the reason behind the trend.

After all, an overwhelming number of respondents said they were carrying handguns for “personal protection.”

“And all of these increases happened before the Covid lockdowns and the “Summer of Love” where many US cities experienced massive rioting, violence and staggering increases in crime,” firearms blog Bearing Arms said. Much of this unleashed a tidal wave of law-abiding citizens panic buying guns, even to this day, for personal protection.

And then there’s this summer’s US Supreme Court’s NYSRPA v. Bruen ruling affirmed the right-to-carry applies outside the home, which forces states to stop arbitrarily denying carry permits to applicants who didn’t meet specific requirements. This ruling has allowed millions of gun owners to conceal carry if they take a two-day class and pass a background check.

Suppose the authors were to update the study for the pandemic years and the Bruen ruling. In that case, we believe the number of Americans packing heat has dramatically increased as the country is plagued with violent crime in progressively run cities.

On Wednesday, the Hobbs campaign issued an official statement revealing its headquarters had been broken into before telling voters “Kari Lake and her allies have been spreading dangerous misinformation and inciting threats against anyone they see fit.”

“The threats against Arizonans attempting to exercise their constitutional rights and their attacks on elected officials are the direct result of a concerted campaign of lies and intimidation. It won’t work,” the Hobbs statement added.

The Drudge Report ran a headline reading, “Hobbs Blasts Kari Lake for ‘Inciting Threats’ After Campaign HQ Burglarized…”

On Thursday, CNN reporter Kate Sullivan asked Kari Lake about the Hobbs campaign headquarters robbery and if she had a response to the Hobbs team insinuating she was responsible.

“That is absolutely absurd,” Lake answered. “And, are you guys buying that? Are you really buying that? Because this sounds like a Jussie Smollet part two. So, you’re going to drag the American people through something like this?”

She continued, “Obviously, you don’t want to cover the real story today, which we are up eleven percent in the polls and you want to distract the people with an old story. I can’t believe she would blame my amazing people or blame me for something like that. I don’t even know where her campaign office is, I’m assuming it’s in a basement somewhere because that’s where she’s been campaigning.”

Later on Thursday, Phoenix police announced the arrest of 36-year-old illegal alien Daniel Mota Dos Reis in connection with the Hobbs campaign headquarters break-in.

Dos Reis was recognized by an officer viewing security camera footage of the Hobbs HQ theft because the suspect was arrested previously that same day for a different burglary.

The situation is ironic on many levels, with one being that the man is illegal and Kari Lake is strong and outspoken about strengthening the border while Hobbs is weak on immigration.

It’s also ironic because the homeless illegal immigrant was released from police custody hours after committing a separate crime thanks to soft-on-crime Democrat policies like the ones supported by Hobbs.

Lastly, in the most shocking example of irony, the suspect allegedly describes himself on Facebook as a pro-mask “Democrat,” according to Western Journal.

Dos Reis was re-arrested and booked on one count of third-degree burglary in relation to the Hobbs campaign HQ incident.

infowars,Police,7043,infowars,"A new UN report found that Ukrainian officials ignored a nursing home’s request to evacuate its elderly and disabled residents to safety and instead allegedly mined the surrounding roads and had the military take up positions in the care facility and use its residents as human shields.

When Russia attacked the Ukrainian military’s outpost and allegedly injured or killed many of the residents within that they were using as human shields, the Ukrainians accused Russia of committing war crimes.

In fact, when the residents who survived the attack fled from the building into a nearby forest they were provided with aid by Russian forces.

From the AP, “UN says Ukraine bears share of blame for nursing home attack”:

Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Russian forces assaulted a nursing home in the eastern region of Luhansk. Dozens of elderly and disabled patients, many of them bedridden, were trapped inside without water or electricity. The March 11 assault set off a fire that spread throughout the facility, suffocating people who couldn’t move. A small number of patients and staff escaped and fled into a nearby forest, finally getting assistance after walking for 5 kilometers (3 miles). In a war awash in atrocities, the attack on the nursing home near the village of Stara Krasnyanka stood out for its cruelty. And Ukrainian authorities placed the fault squarely on Russian forces, accusing them of killing more than 50 vulnerable civilians in a brutal and unprovoked attack. But a new U.N. report has found that Ukraine’s armed forces bear a large, and perhaps equal, share of the blame for what happened in Stara Krasnyanka, which is about 580 kilometers (360 miles) southeast of Kyiv. A few days before the attack, Ukrainian soldiers took up positions inside the nursing home, effectively making the building a target. At least 22 of the 71 patients survived the assault, but the exact number of people killed remains unknown, according to the United Nations. The report by the U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights doesn’t conclude the Ukrainian soldiers or the Russian troops committed a war crime. But it said the battle at the Stara Krasnyanka nursing home is emblematic of the human rights office’s concerns over the potential use of “human shields” to prevent military operations in certain areas.

Here’s the excerpt straight from the report:

Using civilians as human shields is a war crime but it’s par for the course for the Ukrainian military.

The “United We Stand” summit builds on the administration’s push to root out racially motivated domestic violent extremists. The threat sparked a sweeping strategy that included the creation of a specialized Justice Department unit to combat domestic terrorism. Mr. Biden will deliver the keynote address to highlight the administration’s response to hate and “put forward a shared vision for a more united America,” officials said.

The usual cast of characters will be in attendance.

The same cast of characters are also now running the Pentagon and purging the military.

Current and former FBI agents tell The Washington Times that the perceived threat has become overblown under the administration. They say bureau analysts and top officials are pressuring FBI agents to create domestic terrorist cases and tag people as White supremacists to meet internal metrics. “The demand for White supremacy” coming from FBI headquarters “vastly outstrips the supply of White supremacy,” said one agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We have more people assigned to investigate White supremacists than we can actually find.” The agent said those driving bureau policies “have already determined that White supremacy is a problem” and set agencywide policy to elevate racially motivated domestic extremism cases as priorities. “We are sort of the lapdogs as the actual agents doing these sorts of investigations, trying to find a crime to fit otherwise First Amendment-protected activities,” he said. “If they have a Gadsden flag and they own guns and they are mean at school board meetings, that’s probably a domestic terrorist.”

Every agent they have chasing “white supremacy” to advance their “white extremist” narrative is an agent not fighting the unprecedented crime surge in our major cities.

We hear so much about “systemic oppression” and “racial bias” in policing in relation to minority groups and yet here we have the highest law enforcement officers in the land systematically targeting white people to overcharge them with “domestic violent extremism”-related offenses and offering agents “awards and promotions” to frame them based off their race.",Police
infowars,Police,8266,infowars,"A woman was arrested after allegedly stealing a police car and crashing it into a tree in Missouri this week, according to reports.

The wild incident unfolded on Sunday in Velda Village Hills, located in St. Louis County.

Authorities were alerted about a woman behaving erratically while possibly under the influence of unknown substances, KMOV reports.

“She just asked if she could sit down for a moment to get herself together,” said local resident Scharell Houston.

“Then when she got up she was trying to go into people’s houses and go into people’s cars.”

Officers were attempting to comfort and assess the shoeless woman while waiting for EMS when the situation spiraled out of control.

Body cam footage and video shot by a witness show what transpired.

“Listen you’re not in trouble so just relax,” an officer tells Brown as she squats near a tree.

Suddenly, she can be seen running away, circling around a patrol car, and jumping into the driver’s seat.

Officers frantically pull the door open as the vehicle takes off down the street.

The car slams into a tree before the suspect throws it in reverse and crashes into another tree.

Brown was apprehended at the scene and admitted to a mental health facility for evaluation, STL Today reports.

On Monday, she was charged with felony counts of property damage and stealing a motor vehicle.",Police
infowars,Police,9171,infowars,"A 22-year-old woman named Anndel Taylor was found frozen to death inside her vehicle after being trapped in this weekend’s historic snowstorm in Buffalo, New York.

Taylor is one of nearly 35 people who died in the Eerie County area with local governments warning there are likely more bodies yet to be located.

There have been at least 70 deaths from the storm nationwide.

The young woman sent a video to her mother on Friday before ultimately passing away from carbon monoxide poisoning.

Taylor’s mother, Wanda Brown Steele, explained, “The car was running, and the snow was still coming, so it blocked the pipes, the exhaust pipe. Then after the car cut off, that’s when she iced up.”

Speaking to WSOC, Steele added, “I feel like everybody that tried to get to her got stuck. Fire department, police, everybody got stuck. Why didn’t they have chains on their tires? This is a state that is known for snow.”

The family suspects Taylor may have been stuck in the storm for 18 hours.

Days after the tragedy, Steele told DailyMail.com, “My children and I are angry. She was in the car too long. From Friday to Christmas.”

With conditions still difficult to navigate through, law enforcement had to get help from a citizen to transport Taylor after she was located.

“The coroner never came,” said Taylor’s mother. “A random woman had to pick her up. She and the police put her body in her car because the coroner never came.”

As people sat in their cars and froze to death or inhaled carbon monoxide, looters ransacked the city of Buffalo and put even more stress on local store owners and police.",Police
infowars,Police,8161,infowars,"Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky responded on Monday to a peace plan put forward by Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, which called on Ukraine to make some concessions to Russia.

In a poll on Twitter, Zelensky asked his followers “which Elon Musk” they “like more”: the one “who supports Ukraine,” or the one“who supports Russia.” At time of writing, just under 85% chose the former.

Earlier on Monday, Musk suggested that Russia hold new UN-supervised referendums in its newly-acquired territories, while Ukraine formally relinquishes its claim to Crimea, guarantees the peninsula’s water supply, and declares itself a neutral country.

“This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end,” Musk continued, adding that it is “just a question of how many people die before then.”

Musk put the plan to a poll, where around 60% of respondents approved before the vote swung against him. Musk attributed this rapid change in results to the “biggest bot attack I’ve ever seen.”

Amid criticism from pro-Ukrainian posters and officials in Kiev, Musk stood firm, arguing that Russia’s population advantage guarantees it victory should Zelensky follow through on his stated goal of retaking Crimea and Moscow declare war in response.

While Zelensky’s poll leaned heavily to one side, the Ukrainian leader was criticized by some pundits for engaging in such social media tiffs. “This guy does photoshoots for Vogue and sits on a never-ending mountain of cash from [the] west…and then gets angry when Elon suggests that maybe ending the war before more of his people needlessly die is a thing worth pursuing,” American conservative Greg Price wrote.

Musk has lent Zelensky his support before, offering Ukraine terminals to access his satellite-based Starlink internet service in the early days of the conflict. However, he resisted pressure from “some governments” to block Russian news sites on the service, and admitted to colleagues that he thought RT made “some good points.”",Police
latimes,Abortion,9283,latimes,"Back when it seemed a huge Republican wave was building, Washington Sen. Patty Murray was among those who faced the prospect of being swept away.

At 71, Murray is far removed from her plucky 1992 campaign, when the self-described mom in tennis shoes took on “the guys in red ties and dark suits” and won an upset victory.

Now it’s Republican Tiffany Smiley, 41 and a mother of three, who has the fresh face and benefit of being a Beltway outsider.

Smiley’s prodigious fundraising and inspiring back story, as a triage nurse and fighter for disabled veterans like her husband, has Republicans hoping Washington will elect its first GOP senator since Bill Clinton was in the White House.

That could still happen.

But the Supreme Court’s June decision overturning the constitutional right to abortion has thrown Murray a vital lifeline, as it has Democrats across the country, boosting her chances of overcoming the undertow incumbents typically face in a midterm election when their party holds the White House.

“It woke up a sleeping Democratic segment of the electorate that was either not paying much attention or buying into the ‘red wave’ and feeling they were going to get crushed,” said Stuart Elway, a nonpartisan pollster in Seattle. “It added some turbocharge to her campaign.”

The GOP still seems likely to take control of the House, as Republicans need to pick up just five Democratic-held seats. But gains on the order of 35 or more seats, which once seemed quite plausible, now appear beyond reach.

Control of the 50-50 Senate seems to be a toss-up, which is better than it looked for Democrats before the high court thrust the abortion issue front-and-center by handing regulation back to individual states. Since then, nearly half have curtailed or moved to outlaw the procedure.

Democrats are staking a huge amount on the issue.

The party has already spent more than an estimated $124 million this year on TV ads mentioning abortion, more than twice as much as the next issue — character — and almost 20 times more than Democrats spent on abortion-related advertising in the 2018 midterm campaign, according to the Associated Press.

The investment in abortion-related ads was more, the AP reported, than the GOP’s combined spending on spots relating to the economy, crime and immigration, which the party would rather emphasize.

Murray, who is seeking her sixth term, is among those who’ve most aggressively sought to capitalize on the Supreme Court decision. Abortion has been legal in Washington state since voters approved a 1970 ballot measure — more than two years before the Roe vs. Wade ruling that had legalized abortion nationwide.

“It would only take a single vote in Congress to make abortion a crime and punish women and doctors nationwide, even in Washington,” a female narrator says urgently — and hyperbolically — in one of Murray’s ads. (Passing a nationwide ban would almost certainly require more than a single vote, even if the Senate remained tied at 50-50, given the need for 60 votes to overcome an inevitable filibuster.)

“Don’t give them their chance,” the ad concludes. “Oppose Tiffany Smiley before it’s too late.”

The spot is part of a larger effort to paint Smiley, who calls herself “100% pro-life,” as extreme.

Murray has also run an ad filled with graphic images of Jan. 6 that recounted her frightening experience in the Capitol the day pro-Trump insurgents sought to overturn President Biden’s victory. “Democracy,” Murray says solemnly, “is on the ballot.”

Like many blue-state Republicans, Smiley carefully picked her way through the primary season, seeking to avoid the MAGA label without incurring the wrath of the Trump faithful. Since advancing under Washington’s top-two system — she finished second to Murray — Smiley has performed a bit of cosmetic surgery on her website, excising a section that questioned the integrity of the 2020 vote.

But her most direct attempt to steer to the political center has come in a TV spot in which Smiley looks directly into the camera and declares her opposition to a federal abortion ban. (She has said she respects the will of Washington voters and the law they enacted decades ago.)

Set among soothing earth tones, as a guitar gently strums in the background, Smiley asks, “What’s extreme? Thirty years in the Senate and nothing to show for it.

“Patty Murray wants to scare you,” she concludes. “I want to serve you.”

In a subsequent spot, Smiley goes after her Democratic rival by wedding the issues of crime and inflation.

“These doors are closed because it’s too dangerous to ask employees to work here anymore,” Smiley says as she stands before a shuttered, graffiti-scarred Starbucks in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood. “You can’t even get a cup of coffee from the hometown shop... even if you could still afford it.”

The August primary saw an unusually high turnout of women and young voters, part of a pattern across the country since the Supreme Court handed down its abortion decision.

Cathy Allen, a Democratic strategist who teaches political science at the University of Washington in Seattle, was struck by the attitude of students who aren’t particularly enamored of either major political party or the dilatory way elected leaders have addressed concerns like climate change.

The abortion decision angered and energized them — “They have this sense of injustice,” Allen said — and spurred some otherwise discouraged or apathetic to vote.

Whether that sort of passion persists, or inflation and recession fears override the abortion issue and drag down Biden and fellow Democrats, will determine not only whether Washington has a new senator, but which party controls the chamber for the next two years.",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9262,latimes,"Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Friday that immediately protects abortion providers in California from liability when caring for patients traveling from areas where the procedure is now banned or access is narrowed.

Assembly Bill 1666 by Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda) will protect providers and patients in California from civil liability judgements based on claims made in antiabortion states. It further cements the state’s efforts to be a “beacon of hope” in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.

Newsom said the law will push back against Republican states that allow private lawsuits against abortion providers and patients. Last year, Texas passed a law that allows private citizens to sue anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“We will in no way shape or form, support, enable, investigate, resource, any of those activities or energies,” Newsom said, adding that the new law is part of a larger package of more than a dozen bills aimed at providing “true sanctuary” for those seeking or providing abortions in the state.

California has been preparing for months for the likelihood that thousands of people would travel to the state from areas of the country where bans are resurrected for the first time since 1973. Various bills and budget proposals are in the works, calling for millions to be set aside for abortion services for the uninsured, workforce programs to increase the number of providers and to assist patients with the cost of traveling from other states.

The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports reproductive health and abortion rights, said 26 states will ban all, or nearly all, abortions now that the landmark case has been overturned.

UCLA’s Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy released a report this month estimating that 8,000 to 16,000 more people will travel to California each year for abortion care. That includes up to 9,400 more people from antiabortion states seeking care in Los Angeles County alone, according to the report.

California law grants anyone of reproductive age “the fundamental right to choose to bear a child or to choose and to obtain an abortion.” That includes minors, who under state law can consent to an abortion without their parents’ knowledge.

The state allows a woman to have an abortion until the point that a physician determines “there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures” or if the procedure is necessary in order to “protect the life or health of the woman.”

State law does not stipulate the exact point in a pregnancy when viability occurs, instead allowing a physician to make that determination based on “good-faith medical judgment.” In most cases, doctors have considered a fetus viable at 24 weeks.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said the state will ensure that patients are provided the reproductive care they need, no matter where they live.

“You have the right to an abortion here,” Bonta said. “You have the right to an abortion before viability without a reason. You have the right to an abortion after viability to protect your life or your health. You have the right to obtain an abortion without parental consent. I will not back down from defending these rights, expanding them and keeping our clinics accessible and safe, because in California, we refuse to turn back the clock and let radical ideologies exert control over your body.”",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9310,latimes,"For some Los Angeles voters, a packed room in Mid-City was a place of affirmation and reinvigorated focus Monday amid a scandal that’s fractured City Hall and fueled racial tensions ahead of the mayoral election.

U.S. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris for a moderated discussion with Celinda Vázquez, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood Los Angeles, about the fight for reproductive rights, the fears felt by women across the U.S. and the country’s place on the international stage as a moral lodestar.

An audience of at least 200 people greeted the women with a standing ovation at the Nate Holden Performing Arts Center as “Hail, Columbia,” the entrance march of the vice president, played.

Bass and Harris embraced and showered each other with praise — lending political support in a high-stakes election season after they were once pitted against each other as possible vice presidential candidates.

“You and I have worked together for so many years, when I was [California attorney general] and you were at the Capitol, the state Capitol, and then in Washington, D.C.,” Harris said of Bass, who is facing developer Rick Caruso in next month’s L.A. mayoral election. “You are a courageous, fearless fighter on so many of these issues, and in particular, what you have done throughout your career to be a strong voice for women, for children, for all communities, for the coalition.”

Jasmine Hernandez, 21, said Bass has a track record of fighting for people’s rights and working to bring unity — attributes that are all the more important in the wake of a leaked recording that captured then-L.A. City Council President Nury Martinez making racist remarks.

The audio, which remained private for nearly a year, broke to the surface Oct. 9, roiling City Hall and reigniting tensions in Black and brown communities around the city.

Martinez resigned from her seat days later, but Gil Cedillo and Kevin de León, the two other council members present for the wide-ranging conversation with Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera, have so far refused to step down, fueling further outrage.

Hernandez said she believes Bass can bridge that divide.

“So I’m really all for her and stand behind her. And I hope she wins,” she said as she waited for Harris, Bass and Vázquez to take the stage.

Although the mayor of Los Angeles may not wield much power on the issue of abortion, Hernandez said Bass’ advocacy for abortion access remains crucial.

“L.A. is one of the biggest cities in California and in the United States, and there’s a really big opportunity here for L.A. to lead,” she said. “Even though there are a lot of decisions that she can have a stance on but can’t necessarily have a direct effect on, she’s a public figure, she definitely can influence people.”

And the leaked audio scandal is a reminder that not all Democrats are alike, Hernandez said — a point she believes is true in the mayoral race as well.

“Someone can be labeled a Democrat on paper, it doesn’t mean that behind closed doors they’re having those honest conversations. And I think Karen Bass is definitely genuine about the fact that she is a Democrat and behind closed doors, she’s fighting for our rights, versus someone who wants to run for mayor and will just change their label,” Hernandez said, alluding to Caruso, who was previously a Republican and had “no party preference” before registering as a Democrat.

Emily Piñeda, 22, said she wants to see Bass continue to push for women, people of color and other marginalized groups as mayor.

She “has been in L.A. in the real parts of it, and not just the rich parts, and representing us for four decades,” Piñeda said.

Diana Chavez, 23, wanted “an update” from Harris on federal efforts to protect the nation’s reproductive rights.

“I’m thankful that our governor of California has been … able to provide services for our Californians,” but there still needs to be action on a national level, Chavez said.

She intends to vote for Bass for mayor and told The Times that Bass is “the only candidate that mainly aligns with my values as a woman, my values as a woman of color.”

And she sees her decision to vote for Bass in November as a long-term investment in protecting access to abortion.

“Because later on, who knows who she might run with or, in the future, she might be someone bigger,” Chavez said. “Maybe the next president of the United States?”",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9257,latimes,"Democratic Rep. Mike Levin will face Republican Brian Maryott in the fall election in the 49th Congressional District, which straddles Orange and San Diego counties. The district is viewed by the GOP as a possible pickup as it aims to retake control of Congress.

After redistricting, Democrats here have a little more than a 2-point voter edge. Maryott, one of three main Republicans competing to take on the two-term incumbent, emerged Wednesday as the second-place finisher in the primary. The former mayor of San Juan Capistrano partly funded his own campaign and was endorsed by the state GOP.

During the primary, Levin sent out mailers to GOP voters in the district that emphasized another candidate’s support of the repeal of Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion across the nation and that the Supreme Court is poised to overturn — messaging that would likely boost the candidate’s credentials among conservatives. Maryott, the mailer said, had not taken a public position on Roe.

Maryott responded that he has consistently opposed abortion and that Levin had “clearly shown his hand” in which rival he wanted to face in the general election.

This race is one of several in the state expected to be hotly contested by both parties in November. Republicans are expected to take control of at least one chamber of Congress, and California’s congressional delegation, which will still be the largest in the nation at 52 members despite losing a seat after reapportionment, will help determine how much power Republicans have.

GOP schools trustee John Briscoe won the second spot in the November runoff to represent a new, overwhelmingly Democratic, Latino-majority district that stretches from southeast L.A. cities down to Long Beach.

Democrat Robert Garcia, Long Beach’s mayor, had already clinched the top spot. Briscoe, an Ocean View School District trustee and a real estate broker, edged out Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia as the runner-up in the top-two primary. Democrats have a 38-point voter registration edge in the new 42nd Congressional District.

The state’s redistricting commission combined chunks of districts represented by two veteran members of Congress, who both announced in December that they would retire at the end of their terms.

Robert Garcia had a significant edge in endorsements and fundraising in the race. One of his first television ads highlighted Briscoe’s ties to former President Trump, a move political experts saw as an effort to raise the profile of a weaker rival. With the district’s deep blue tilt, a Republican opponent would face a far more difficult climb in November.",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9341,latimes,"Former President Trump — who picked many of his party’s candidates and demanded fealty from them throughout the 2022 midterm campaign — was likely an albatross for the GOP Tuesday night, limiting Republicans’ gains in a midterm election the party expected to dominate.

But if recent history is any guide, Trump’s not going anywhere. The once and likely future presidential candidate is unpopular, but he continues to exercise outsized sway over the Republican base, and could hamstring the party for the next two years and beyond.

As vote-counting continued Wednesday morning, Republicans still had a chance to win both chambers of Congress.

Republicans, though in position to take the House, were sweating it out Wednesday and would need to hold their narrow leads in many of the remaining races to eke out a narrow win. Races in California, where Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has focused attention, could prove decisive.

Paradoxically, a small majority for Republicans would likely give Trump more leverage in Congress, as McCarthy would have to depend on continued support from Trump acolytes such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to maintain power.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson was declared the winner in Wisconsin just before noon Central time, giving Republicans a 49-48 lead with races in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada yet to be decided. With neither candidate in Georgia winning more than 50% of the vote, the race will go to a Dec. 6 runoff like the one that decided Senate control in 2020. A 50-50 split in the Senate would give Democrats control with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote.

The close races for control of Congress defy history. The party that holds the White House usually absorbs big midterm election losses. President Biden’s low approval in polls, fueled by persistent inflation, made sizable Republican gains even more likely, at least on paper.

“Definitely not a Republican wave, that’s for darn sure,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday night on NBC as he predicted a narrow win for Republicans in the Senate.

The combination of Trump’s low popularity, the generally weak general-election performance of the candidates he endorsed, the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection that he inspired and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the right to an abortion this year appear to have drawn Democrats closer than expected. Exit polls conducted by media organizations showed two-thirds of independent voters hold an unfavorable view of the former president.

The latest blow to Republicans: Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a top target in the swing state of Michigan, was declared the winner overnight.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another Democrat, also won her race, defeating Trump-backed candidate Tudor Dixon.

The Michigan results highlight one of the Republican Party’s biggest disappointments. Trump attacked Whitmer relentlessly. Michigan was a key part of the 2016 coalition that propelled Trump’s surprising victory over Hillary Clinton. The state’s historic ties to manufacturing and large population of white working-class voters gave the party hope that the state would trend red as the GOP moved further toward Trump’s brand of populism aimed at capturing economic and cultural anxiety.

But Biden won the state back in 2020, stanching the party’s losses in the upper Midwest.

Michigan voters also approved the most high-profile ballot measure to protect abortion rights, and voters in Kentucky rejected an antiabortion measure that would have added language to the state constitution.

National exit polls this year showed inflation was a top concern among voters. But abortion ranked second. That, and the relative weakness of Trump-backed candidates, helped Democrats stay in the fight.

Many voters appeared willing to swallow their disappointment with Biden. An NBC exit poll showed Democrats narrowly winning — 49% to 45% — among voters who “somewhat disapprove” of Biden’s performance.

The Republicans’ loss of a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, another northern industrial state, could prove the most consequential if Democrats keep the chamber. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz, a television doctor and first-time candidate backed by Trump. Fetterman, still recovering from the effects of a stroke, painted the untested Oz as an elite carpetbagger.

Many of the gubernatorial candidates Trump backed also lost or were in danger of losing as of Wednesday morning.

An exception was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who won reelection in a landslide that permeated races throughout the state. Republicans also performed well in Iowa — winning or leading in almost every major race — while making gains in blue New York, where they appeared likely to win four Democratic-held House seats. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat who led his party’s efforts to keep the House, conceded his own race Wednesday morning to Mike Lawler, a Republican state assemblyman.

DeSantis is seen as Trump’s biggest threat for the 2024 presidential nomination. But even if party leaders prefer DeSantis, Trump has said he will run again. Opinion polls, at least for now, show him as the prohibitive favorite to capture the party’s nomination.

Jason Miller, an advisor to Trump, told the BBC Wednesday morning that he was urging Trump to push back an announcement that he would run again from next week — as he has been teasing — to December, to avoid distracting from a potential Senate runoff in Georgia. But Miller said he remained 100% certain that Trump would run.

“Many of the people who are championing Ron DeSantis for president are the same people who were skeptical of President Trump ever since he came down the escalator in 2015,” Miller said, recalling Trump’s improbable 2016 announcement.

Miller predicted that Trump would “have his hands full” but ultimately win the nomination again.",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9270,latimes,"Disney has been facing a firestorm from conservative Republicans in recent months over the company’s vow to help repeal a Florida law that limits how LGBTQ people and issues can be talked about in schools.

Now, Democrats are irate over a decision by the Disney-owned streaming service Hulu to not air ads about abortion and guns — two central points in Democrats’ midterm campaigns.

“Hulu’s censorship of the truth is outrageous, offensive, and another step down a dangerous path for our country,” according to a statement by the leaders of the Democrats’ Senate and congressional campaign committees and gubernatorial association. “Voters have the right to know the facts about MAGA Republicans’ agenda on issues like abortion — and Hulu is doing a huge disservice to the American people by blocking voters from learning the truth about the GOP record or denying these issues from even being discussed.”

A person at Disney familiar with the matter said that while Hulu accepts candidate ads, the streaming service was firmly within its rights to decide which ads to air.

“To minimize misinformation and to protect the consumer experience, Hulu’s long-standing guidelines prohibit advertising that takes a position on a controversial issue of public importance, and Hulu has always reviewed candidate ads on a case-by-case basis,” the person said.

The kerfuffle began July 15, when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Democratic Governors Assn. sought to place ads about abortion rights and gun violence on Hulu, Facebook, YouTube, Roku, NBC/Universal, ESPN and the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia, according to a national Democratic Party official. The last two, like Hulu, are also owned by Disney.

One ad argues that the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs. Wade is the result of a “coordinated Republican attack on abortion” and that the GOP would seek to ban abortions nationwide. The other cites statistics on gun deaths including the number of children killed and claims that “Republicans are more devoted to the gun lobby than taking common sense action to make our kids safe.”

“Make your voice heard” by voting in November, both ads conclude.

The ads ran on every outlet except Hulu, which has more than 45 million subscribers. In addition to streaming many broadcast and cable stations’ shows, it creates original programming such as the award-winning “The Handmaid’s Tale” series.

Jessica Levinson, an election law professor at Loyola Marymount University, said Hulu was legally in the clear. Though the 1934 Communications Act requires television networks to air ads from the major political parties, there is no similar mandate for streaming services.

“Legally, Hulu can basically pick and choose which political advertisements to run. This is another example of technology outpacing the law,” she said. “If people don’t like Hulu’s decision, the solution is to cancel your subscription, not file a lawsuit.”

Indeed, some social media users tweeted about canceling their subscriptions using the hashtag #BoycottHulu. Others coopted the hashtag to express gratefulness for not having to watch political ads.

Earlier this year, liberals were angry when Disney did not initially speak out about Florida’s “Parental Rights in Education” law, called the “Don’t Say Gay” law by its critics. After the law passed and the company faced employee protests, Disney pledged to help repeal the measure. Conservatives were outraged; conspiracy theorists and pundits accused Disney of nefarious intent against children. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation aiming to end special privileges in a dedicated area of Central Florida that is home to Walt Disney World Resort.

“You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state? We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that,” DeSantis said in April after signing the legislation.

The conservative backlash has not stopped. Last week, Turning Point USA’s founder called for a boycott. “It’s time they realized that if they go woke, then they go broke!” Charlie Kirk wrote in an email to supporters.

In the midst of the firestorm over LGBTQ rights in Florida, employees of Pixar, another Disney subsidiary, took the company to task for removing moments of “overtly gay affection” from its movies. In response, Disney restored a brief same-sex kiss in the “Toy Story” spinoff “Lightyear” that had been edited out.",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9279,latimes,"Democrats are on defense as Republicans try to wrest control of the House in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. California, despite its deep-blue tilt, offers chances for both parties to flip seats.

Going into this election year, California was home to two of the nation’s most vulnerable GOP incumbents; redistricting made their districts even less favorable. Two popular Democrats were drawn into extremely tight districts, making them vulnerable if a red wave materializes.

Depending on how close the battle for the House becomes, the outcomes of those hotly contested races could determine control of Congress; at a minimum, they will influence the margin of power. Both parties are pouring tens of millions of dollars, staff and other resources into winning these contests.

Nationwide, Republicans need to pick up a net of just five seats to flip control of the House.

The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which has tracked House and Senate races for decades, rates three California races as toss-ups and highlights seven others that are expected to draw significant money and attention. This article uses the Cook ratings. Already, some $74 million has been booked for fall TV and radio advertising in those 10 races.

The party that holds the White House typically loses seats in midterm elections. Until recently, analysts predicted the Democrats would face even bigger losses than normal because of President Biden’s low approval ratings, economic uncertainty and global challenges such as Russia’s war on Ukraine.

But the picture looks different now, largely because of the Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe vs. Wade — the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion across the nation. That decision has changed the calculus and shows signs of galvanizing young and minority voters who tend to support Democrats but typically don’t vote in large numbers in nonpresidential elections. It could also whose votes have been critical in recent campaigns, including in key Orange County swing districts.

Republicans in tight races are keeping relatively quiet about abortion issues, but Democrats are trying to keep them at the front of voters’ minds and are expected to spend heavily in the fall to do so. A ballot measure to amend the California Constitution to further enshrine abortion rights is also likely to keep voters in the state focused on the issue, as could some Republicans’ promises to push a federal ban.

Republicans are also having a difficult time keeping voters focused on Biden when former President Trump continues to make news with the court fights over the FBI search at his Florida resort and residence, which led to the seizure of numerous classified documents. In addition, the hearings of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol are scheduled to resume in the weeks leading up to the election.

This election takes place after the once-every-decade following the U.S. census — by an independent commission, in California’s case. Despite losing a seat for the first time in its history because its population didn’t grow as fast as other states’, California’s 52-member delegation will still be the nation’s largest.

Before the Supreme Court’s decision in June reversing Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling guaranteeing a national right to abortion, Garcia signed onto an amicus brief asking justices to overturn Roe. The day the decision was announced, Garcia put out a statement saying abortion was now an issue for the states.

“If you are concerned over your abortion rights, call your state assemblyman or senator as the law now falls under the guidance of Sacramento,” he wrote.

After the primary election, he indicated in a statement to The Times that he supported exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s health — a departure from the Life at Conception bill that he cosponsored.

Smith has been a vocal defender of abortion rights. In a statement to The Times she said that “supporting reproductive rights has been one of the centerpieces” of her political career.

“As a woman who is a high-risk, near-death first pregnancy survivor, and had a complicated decision to carry a second pregnancy to term, I have been a stalwart advocate for greater access to services in my community and will continue to defend a woman’s right to unfettered access to safe, legal abortion services, including now codifying abortion rights into law.”",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9364,latimes,"Republican Rep. Mike Garcia has won reelection to his northern Los Angeles County seat, dashing Democrats’ hopes they could reclaim a district where they had a sizable registration advantage. His win pushed Republicans to the majority in the next Congress.

Garcia defeated Christy Smith, a Democratic former state lawmaker whom he had bested in a 2019 special election race and in 2020, when he won by just 333 votes. The Associated Press called the race Wednesday, though official results will take longer.

“It will be an honor for me to represent you in the majority,” Garcia said in a written statement. “I look forward to delivering all forms of security for our district and our nation, whether you voted for me or not.”

Smith thanked donors and volunteers, and said on social media: “There is so much more work to be done to reach voters here who no longer see the value of their vote. I know that work will continue in the hands of very dedicated local Democrats.”

Going into the midterm cycle, California’s 27th Congressional District was a tantalizing pickup opportunity for Democrats. Republicans had represented the area, which includes the Antelope Valley and Santa Clarita, for decades before the 2018 blue wave broke the GOP’s streak.

Though Garcia flipped the seat back to Republican control after the Democratic incumbent resigned, redistricting and changing demographics made the area appear friendlier for Democrats. The party has a double-digit registration advantage in the redrawn seat, which backed Joe Biden over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential race by 12 points.

Despite the Democratic tilt of the district, however, residents’ frustrations with climbing gas prices and the high cost of living gave Garcia the edge. He also touted his background as a Navy pilot, which resonates in this region with long ties to the military and aerospace industry.

Garcia, 46, puzzled many political observers when, on Jan. 6, 2021, he objected to counting the electoral college votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania, joining 146 other House Republicans. The vote occurred just hours after a mob of Trump’s supporters overran the U.S. Capitol and assaulted police officers in an attempt to block Biden’s win. While Garcia had plenty of company in the House GOP conference, few others were in competitive districts.

Democrats signaled early that they would highlight Garcia’s vote in their campaign against him, and the congressman initially appeared on the defensive. But the focus in the race gradually shifted to other issues that drove the 2022 midterms: the economy and abortion rights. Garcia’s ads emphasized low taxes and his work on behalf of veterans, while Smith emphasized Garcia’s support for a nationwide abortion ban.

Smith, 53, raised $3.5 million for her campaign through mid-October, a considerable sum for a challenger. But the former state assemblywoman got little help on the airwaves from Democratic campaign committees and outside groups, which largely avoided the expensive Los Angeles media market.

On Sunday, Smith said in a long Twitter thread that “our campaign got next to zero outside resources to fight this battle.”

“When it comes to paid comms on TV, digital and mail, without DC help to define Garcia and elevate our positive agenda, we didn’t stand a chance,” Smith said. She added that with the possibility that the district would be “the tipping point to hold the House, the utter lack of investment made no sense.”

As the incumbent, Garcia had the fundraising edge, bringing in more than $6.5 million. He also got a boost from the House Republican campaign arm and the super PAC aligned with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy. In all, Garcia and his allies spent more than $7 million on television and digital advertising, while Smith spent just shy of $1 million.",Abortion
latimes,Abortion,9352,latimes,"Rep. Julia Brownley has hung on to her Ventura County-based congressional seat in an overwhelmingly Democratic district that at the last minute was viewed as competitive.

The veteran lawmaker defeated Matt Jacobs, a former federal prosecutor, who was seen as an affable but longshot candidate in a district that supported Joe Biden by 20 percentage points. The Associated Press called the race Saturday, though official results will take longer.

Brownley, a Democrat, said in a statement that the contest had been about values, and she criticized “extremists on the right” over their views on abortion. She said while Republicans had focused “solely on inflation, with no plan to address it, they failed to understand that protecting a woman’s right to choose is not only a moral issue, but an economic one. Having politicians dictate what a woman can and cannot do with her own body is profoundly wrong.”

She thanked voters for participating in democracy, adding: “I believe the voters resoundingly affirmed that we succeed as a nation when our democracy is at its strongest. Our economy, our security, and our future are all intertwined with the rule of law, free and fair elections, and the ideal of equality for all.”

The Jacobs campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

The incumbent’s reelection had been considered secure, but in the weeks before the election, Democrats — notably the congresswoman — sounded alarm bells that she was at risk.

In the 26th Congressional District, which includes a sliver of Los Angeles County, Democrats had a 14.8-percentage-point voter registration advantage over Republicans, even after redistricting removed the city of Ventura and added more conservative Simi Valley.

Republicans represented the area for 70 years until Brownley won her congressional seat in 2012. The region’s residents are viewed as less strictly partisan than in other parts of the state; some 20% of registered voters in the district have no party preference.

That dynamic is among the reasons that both candidates highlighted their moderate stances and bipartisan appeal in the campaign. Brownley spoke about her work with Republicans on veterans’ issues, and Jacobs said he would join the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus if elected.

But both are also aligned with their party’s bases. Jacobs said he voted for President Trump in 2016 and 2020, and Brownley made abortion rights — following the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe vs. Wade — a centerpiece of her campaign.

Jacobs said he approves of the high court’s decision on Roe; he added that he would not back a federal abortion ban. The Republican said he supports abortion access in cases of rape, incest and risks to the health of the pregnant woman, but he would not say whether he supported broader abortion rights.

The district was rated “solid Democrat” by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report until just before the race, when it was deemed more competitive and relabeled “lean Democrat.” The move was prompted by a poll that reportedly showed a statistical dead heat between the candidates and last-minute money flowing into the race from House campaign committees and leadership PACs.",Abortion
latimes,COVID,9284,latimes,"“The pandemic is over,” President Biden declared last week as he toured the Detroit Auto Show. “We still have a problem with COVID. We’re still doing a lot of work on it. But the pandemic is over.”

“No one’s wearing masks,” he added, gesturing toward the convention center crowd. “Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.”

But the COVID epidemic isn’t over. It has arguably lost its status as a disease that was utterly beyond control. But it’s still causing more than 400 deaths a day, roughly three times as many as a bad season of influenza. New variants are still emerging; a wave of infections this winter could turn Biden’s optimistic claim to ashes; and long COVID, a debilitating chronic condition, affects an estimated 16 million Americans.

“We are not where we need to be if we are going to, quote, ‘live with the virus,’” Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical advisor, said a day after the president’s statement was broadcast on CBS’ “60 Minutes.” The number of COVID deaths, Fauci said, is still “unacceptably high.”

Biden has a long history of gaffes, statements that misfire or land badly. Most are inconsequential. This wasn’t.

The president’s statement was bad on two levels, public health and politics.

First, public health. For months, Biden and his aides have struggled to persuade Americans to get vaccinated against COVID — and to get boosters, especially if they are 60 or older. The results have been disappointing: Less than half the eligible population has accepted even a single booster. This month, the government rolled out a third booster, optimized for new COVID variants, but fewer than 2% of eligible patients showed up.

“I wish he hadn’t said it,” Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the department of medicine at UC San Francisco, said of Biden’s statement. “It’s not helpful at a time when we’re still trying to get people vaccinated.”

Public health officials are already swapping reports of people who heard Biden’s statement and decided to forgo another vaccination.

“We’re already hearing pushback: ‘If it’s over, why do I need a booster?’” said Dr. Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota. “I get it; the country’s done with the virus. The problem is the virus isn’t done with us.”

Biden’s aides spent much of last week trying to explain. “Look at his whole statement,” White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain said. “The sentence after ‘the pandemic is over’ is ‘we have a lot of work to do.’”

But that nuance was lost in Biden’s upbeat delivery, which sounded like a claim of victory. That’s why Klain was still explaining a week later.

Almost as bad was the political impact. Republicans in Congress crowed that if Biden believes the pandemic has waned, there’s no reason they should vote for more COVID spending.

Biden and his aides have asked Congress for $22.5 billion to pay for vaccines, testing and therapeutic drugs. The request was already stalled in the Senate; the president’s statement made its prospects even dimmer.

Why would Biden say something that landed him in that much trouble?

Joe Biden loves to be the bearer of good news, especially with an election approaching. (No politician likes to be the bearer of bad news with an election approaching.)

He’d undoubtedly like voters to remember that it was under his watch that the pandemic ended — or at least diminished enough that they could throw their irksome masks away.

It wasn’t his only excursion into unwarranted optimism; only two weeks ago he argued that inflation had been tamed when it appears to have plateaued at an 8.3% annual rate.

To be fair, though, Biden has often veered into cockeyed optimism whether an election was near or not.

He declared victory over COVID once before, on July 4, 2021, when he said vaccines would soon deliver an “Independence Day” from the pandemic. That turned out to be a “mission accomplished” moment after variants of the virus caused breakthrough infections among the vaccinated.

In 2019, when Biden began his run for president, he told voters that his election would empower moderates in the Republican Party and produce a miraculous rebirth of old-fashioned bipartisanship. That hasn’t turned out well either.

Optimism can be a good trait in a president. Franklin D. Roosevelt reassured Americans that they could prevail over the Depression and World War II. Ronald Reagan made optimism a hallmark of his vote-winning conservatism.

In Biden’s case, though, overpromising has often backfired.

I once asked Biden, when he was vice president, how to recover from a gaffe. (I figured he knew how by then.) “Own it,” he said emphatically. “Own it.”

That’s what the president ought to do now to repair the damage.

“We have to continue to make the case that COVID is still a threat,” Wachter said. “We still need to encourage people to get a booster. And we need Congress and other policymakers to see ongoing funding as important, including funding for finding a new vaccine and research on long COVID.”

The president was right to celebrate the good news: Thanks to vaccines and therapeutic drugs, COVID isn’t as dangerous as it was two years ago. But without more vaccinations and more research, the disease will still cause tens of thousands of needless deaths.

Biden needs to correct his message, and he shouldn’t wait for the midterm election to do it.",COVID
latimes,COVID,9272,latimes,"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared a state of emergency in California over the spread of the monkeypox virus in order to “bolster the state’s vaccination efforts.”

“California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Newsom said in statement.

Monkeypox is a rare disease similar to smallpox, though usually milder. It is largely spreading among men who have sex with men as well as transgender and nonbinary people, though health officials warn that anyone can contract the virus through direct contact with infectious sores, scabs or body fluids or by touching clothing and bedding used by a person with the virus.

Nearly 800 cases have been confirmed in California, according to the California Department of Public Health’s most recent data as of Thursday. The state reported that 98.3% of those cases were confirmed in men, the majority of whom identify as part of the LGBTQ community.

The proclamation makes it easier for the state to coordinate its response to the outbreak by ordering all state agencies to follow the direction of the Office of Emergency Services and the California Department of Public Health. The order also boosts vaccination efforts by allowing EMS workers to administer vaccines, which remain in short supply.

Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and several other state lawmakers sent a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Monday calling for an emergency budget appropriation of $38.5 million to support local monkeypox testing, vaccination, treatment and outreach for the first 90 days of the outbreak.

“The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it,” Wiener said in a statement after Newsom’s emergency declaration.

Newsom’s office said California has distributed more than 25,000 doses of the vaccine out of a total of 61,000 doses received to date. That total does not include a separate allocation the federal government directed to Los Angeles County.

The governor’s order said the state is “distributing its limited supply of the vaccine to local health jurisdictions based on a formula that considers current monkeypox cases and number of high-risk individuals.”

Those eligible for the vaccine in L.A. County include anyone who had direct contact with someone with monkeypox or attended a high-exposure event. Also eligible under the county’s guidelines are gay and bisexual men and transgender people who visited a commercial sex venue or other venue where they had anonymous sex or sex with multiple partners in the last three weeks, or who were diagnosed with gonorrhea or early syphilis within the last 12 months or are taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis medicine.

The governor’s office said more than 30 facilities and providers across the state are offering treatment for monkeypox, though access to the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat is also limited.

“We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” Newsom said.

Those infected by the virus initially have a fever, aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. Later they develop a rash, usually starting on the face and then spreading, turning into pus-filled sores before healing.

Monkeypox illnesses typically resolve within two to four weeks but can cause severe pain, hospitalization, long-term symptoms and, in rare cases, death.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger urged the county to “draw down all the support available to accelerate the distribution of vaccines and resources to those at risk and suffering from this terrible disease” in response to the governor’s order.

“I will work to ensure we’re doing so quickly and efficiently,” Barger said in a statement. “We don’t have any time to waste.”

An investigation into the first case of monkeypox in California in a person who traveled abroad began on May 21 and was confirmed on May 25.

Under the 1970 California Emergency Services Act, the governor has broad authority to respond during a state of emergency. The governor can “make, amend, and rescind” state regulations and suspend state statutes and has the power to redirect state funds to help in an emergency — even funds appropriated by the California Legislature for an entirely different purpose.

The California Supreme Court in 2021 upheld an appeals court ruling that affirmed Newsom’s emergency powers. Two state Republican lawmakers had challenged Newsom’s power after he declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing he had no right to issue an executive order requiring ballots to be mailed to the state’s 22 million registered voters before the Nov. 3, 2020, election.

The high court ruled the law was constitutional because it required the governor to terminate a declared state of emergency as soon as possible and also allows the Legislature to end it by passing a joint resolution.",COVID

latimes,COVID,9252,latimes,"With just a week until the Biden administration hosts the ninth Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, the agenda is set but the guest list remains shrouded in mystery.

President Biden will host the hemispheric meeting, set to begin Monday, with a focus on what senior administration officials say are the core challenges facing the region: curbing record migration, boosting economic growth, combating climate change and bolstering recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Topping the agenda is tackling the historic flows of migration and addressing the nearly 7 million people who have been displaced from their homes in the region, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe summit preparations.

Biden will stand “shoulder to shoulder” with foreign leaders across the region on the last day of the summit as part of a “bold new plan” to stem migration, the official said.

But the White House remains circumspect about who will actually attend the high-stakes regional conference. That includes whether Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who leads Latin America’s second-most-populous country, will be among the leaders standing by Biden’s side.

Divisions over the U.S. decision to exclude the authoritarian leaders of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela have thrown the guest list into doubt, with the loudest criticism coming from López Obrador, who has yet to decide whether he will attend.

The leaders of Bolivia, Chile and Honduras have expressed doubt about coming to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, most of the Caribbean countries have backed off a threat to boycott.

Every host nation of the summit has discretion in drawing up the guest list, and most if not all countries are routinely included. This is the first time the summit, which takes place every three or four years, is being held in the U.S. since its 1994 inaugural session in Miami.

The Mexican president said Friday he would wait to see whether the U.S. meets his request to invite all countries in the Western Hemisphere, but signaled that he would send a delegate in his place, most likely his U.S.-friendly foreign secretary, Marcelo Ebrard.

White House officials said conversations with the Mexican president have been “respectful,” and that his absence would not undermine the summit’s ambitious agenda. Officials said participants would announce a set of policy decisions highlighting law enforcement cooperation and tackling the criminal smuggling industry. Leaders will also promote agreements that boost support for refugee resettlement and stabilization efforts, as well as promote labor mobility benefiting the U.S. and Canada, which are experiencing labor shortages.

Biden is expected to begin an initiative to promote health infrastructure and training for health workers in the region to help countries prepare for future pandemics, according to senior administration officials.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been tasked with tackling the root causes of migration in the region, will announce a partnership combating climate and energy challenges facing Caribbean nations, officials said. The effort is expected to build on the Caribbean Energy Security Initiative to help those nations overcome their dependence on fossil fuels, an initiative that was started by Biden in 2013 when he was vice president.",COVID
latimes,COVID,9343,latimes,"Eleven competitive congressional races in California that could end up determining the balance of power in the House were still too close to call Wednesday.

Congressional campaigns on both sides of the aisle expressed cautious optimism as election officials continue tallying votes, a process that could take weeks.

With the prospect of the House majority on the line, the entire nation may be kept in suspense because of California’s notoriously plodding count — a scenario few expected in the lead-up to election day.

“I guess I’m surprised that it’s kind of coming down to California,” said Paul Mitchell, vice president of the political data analysis firm PDI. “I expected the Republicans to pick up 10 to 12 seats in the House, and that’s before they even got to California.”

In the 41st Congressional District, Democrat Will Rollins was ahead of Rep. Ken Calvert — the longest serving GOP member of California’s congressional delegation — by more than 7,500 votes, with just 37% of the ballots counted as of Wednesday.

Calvert’s past opposition to gay rights may have hurt him among the Coachella Valley’s large LGBTQ community, said Mitchell, which could be a reason why the early results trended toward Rollins, who is gay.

Rollins remains confident, saying in an interview with The Times that “we feel like we’re going to win this one.”

“There’s still a long way to go and we know it’s going to be close, but this is a pretty powerful lead,” he said.

Calvert’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

On Tuesday, chatter of an impending national “red wave” could be heard across the Orange County nightclub where GOP congressional hopeful Scott Baugh and others gathered to await election results.

The mood in the packed club dampened when the results began rolling in, but Baugh, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Katie Porter to represent the 47th Congressional District in Orange County, remained confident.

“Early returns in California as you know always favor the Democrats. How many of you voted on election day?” he asked the crowd as hands shot up. “You’re going to reverse what the results are right now and you’re going to put us in the lead by midnight.”

At midnight, Baugh was trailing Porter by fewer than 1,000 votes. Less than a day later, Porter’s lead had grown slightly to roughly 1,500 votes.

On Wednesday, the mood in Porter’s camp was one of cautious optimism. In 2018, it took 11 days for the race between Porter and Republican Mimi Walters to be called.

“There are still tens of thousands of ballots left to be counted, and our campaign respects Orange County voters and will wait patiently for the results,” said campaign spokesperson Lindsay Reilly.

The popularity of mail-in ballots means that results can frequently take longer in many states, including California, than voters typically expect, said Paul Gronke, a professor of political science and director of the Elections and Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, Ore.

“It’s going to make it particularly difficult this year with results coming in at different rates, and it’s going to open up a window for people to charge malfeasance,” he said.

Still, he added, just because the vote is taking longer to count doesn’t mean there’s something wrong.

In the Central Valley’s 22nd district, Republican Rep. David Valadao was ahead of Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas by about 3,300 votes with just over a third of the vote counted.

In 2018, publications across the state declared Valadao the winner in his bid for reelection against his Democratic challenger. However, ballot counting continued through the rest of November and Valadao conceded the race in early December.

Valadao acknowledged his campaign “always knew this race was going to be tight,” but he’s hopeful about early returns. Salas said he’s waiting patiently for votes to be counted.

The variables and caveats in the Golden State’s midterm races are many, which makes predictions difficult. The upending of traditional voting methods during the pandemic, uncertainty about the state of democracy and even wet weather on election day could be factors.

Heavy rain over the weekend and on election day might have spurred some voters to mail in ballots at the last minute rather than brave the elements to vote in person, Mitchell said.

Recently, more Republicans have been voting in person on election day because conspiracy theories spread by former President Trump and others have made them distrustful of mail ballots. And since the pandemic, more Democrats have turned to vote by mail. Historically, it was the other way around.

The uncertainty and norm-busting is enough to make Mitchell throw up his hands.

“It’s all over the place,” he said. “We don’t know who voted, and at what magnitude.”",COVID
latimes,COVID,9273,latimes,"The Biden administration on Thursday declared the outbreak of monkeypox a national public health emergency in an effort to raise awareness and accelerate efforts to combat it.

The move comes days after several counties, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, as well as states such as California, Illinois and New York, declared emergencies.

“We’re prepared to take our response to the next level in addressing this virus, and we urge every American to take monkeypox seriously and to take responsibility to help us tackle this virus,” Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said during a briefing with officials and the media.

Monkeypox is a rare disease similar to smallpox, though symptoms are sometimes milder. It is largely spreading among men who have sex with men as well as transgender and nonbinary people, though health officials warn that anyone can contract the virus through direct contact with infectious sores, scabs or body fluids, or by touching clothing or bedding used by a person with the virus. At least five children and one pregnant woman in the U.S. have been infected, public health officials have reported.

The decision to declare a national emergency, which has been under consideration for several weeks, will allow federal agencies to direct more funding toward developing and testing vaccines and other drugs, unlock emergency funding reserves and enable the hiring of additional workers to help manage the outbreak.

But the administration, Becerra said, is holding off for now on a second emergency order that would help fast-track other potential treatments and vaccines, which under such a declaration no longer would have to go through the usual federal reviews.

The World Health Organization declared monkeypox a global public health emergency on July 23, and some state officials have done the same, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who issued a statewide emergency declaration Monday.

“California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Newsom said in a statement.

More than 1,100 cases of monkeypox have been presumed or confirmed in California, according to the California Department of Public Health’s most recent data as of Tuesday. The state reported that 98.3% of those cases were confirmed in men, the majority of whom identify as part of the LGBTQ community.

More than two-thirds of the state’s overall infections have been reported in Los Angeles County and San Francisco. Presumed or confirmed cases in Los Angeles County — 478 as of Thursday — had climbed 56% in the past week. In San Francisco, which was reporting 397 cases as of Wednesday — infections had climbed 35% from the week prior.

Earlier this week, Biden appointed Robert J. Fenton Jr., a longtime official at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, to coordinate the national response to the virus.

Fenton, who also spoke during Thursday’s briefing, vowed to “leave no stone unturned in our efforts to combat this virus.” But the speed at which the virus has spread, he said, is a challenge.

“This is a unique outbreak, and it is spreading faster than previous outbreaks,” he said.

Before April, monkeypox was seldom reported outside Africa, where it is endemic. But a study from the New England Journal of Medicine showed that infections were diagnosed in 16 countries between April 27 and June 24. Within a month, the WHO called the expanding outbreak, which at that point had spread to 70 countries, an “extraordinary” situation.

In the U.S., more than 6,600 cases have been confirmed since May 18, predominantly among gay men. Most experts believe those figures greatly underestimate the actual spread of the virus.

A week ago, Becerra indicated the government had done all it could in response to the outbreak.

“We believe we have done everything we can at the federal level to work with our state and local partners and communities affected to make sure we can stay ahead of this and end this outbreak,” he said in a statement July 28.

At the time, federal leaders announced distribution plans for 780,000 shots of the two-dose Jynneos vaccine, the only monkeypox vaccine currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The doses are to be allocated to states and cities based on case numbers and the size of their at-risk populations.

Currently, the government is reportedly under-supplied in its stockpile of Jynneos. Although officials have said around 1.6 million Americans are at high risk for monkeypox, the U.S. has only enough doses of Jynneos to fully inoculate 550,000 individuals.

The national vaccine stockpile will increase by 150,000 additional doses in September, according to Dawn O’Connell, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at HHS.",COVID
latimes,COVID,9277,latimes,"At the annual meeting of the League of California Cities, members were presented with a detailed report titled “Dealing With Disruptive Members of the Public.”

It included a history of dissent, a listing of several recommended actions and a typology of the protesters known to show up at City Hall: The meeting wreckers. The character assassins. The amateur city attorneys. (“I’ve conducted my own legal research.”)

In other words, the presence of outspoken citizens forcefully sharing their deep and abiding unhappiness with civic leaders is hardly new. It can actually be a healthy thing, accountability being vital to any system that aims to represent the people it serves.

But the level of animosity, violent threats and fly-off-the-handle behavior has hit remarkable heights during the COVID-19 pandemic, startling even longtime observers like Graham Knaus, head of the California State Assn. of Counties. He’s spent nearly a quarter-century involved in local government.

“This isn’t about people with different positions than their local officials,” Knaus said. “This is about severely disruptive behavior. It’s about hate speech. It’s about the increase in intimidation and the number of death threats that have been levied against local officials and their families.”

The result is a new California law that will make it easier to conduct the public’s business by spelling out just how and when bullies, bad actors and dangerous belligerents can be ejected so that school boards, city councils and other local government entities can do their work.

The recently enacted legislation, Senate Bill 1100, amends the 69-year-old Brown Act, which requires local governments to convene their meetings in public and guarantees the right of people to attend and participate.

Among other changes, it defines the meaning of “disrupting” — threatening the use of force, willfully ignoring rules of conduct — and gives the presiding officer the power to oust unruly individuals after they’ve received a warning.

The latter may seem like a small, and obvious, step, but it eliminates the need for a vote of the full body, which may be impossible if things escalate and a meeting is in shambles, or if members are forced to flee the dais for their safety.

The legislation is not, its co-author emphasized, an effort to muzzle dissent or keep anyone from speaking their mind as vociferously as they’d like.

“I consider myself a 1st Amendment purist,” said Dave Cortese, a Democratic state senator from San Jose who spent more than a decade in local government, serving on the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. If anything, Cortese argued, the legislation could enhance free speech by spelling out exactly how and when members of the public can be ejected once they’ve been fairly warned.

The law makes it clear that “if you’re going to be thrown out, it better be for something real and actual” that’s preventing a meeting from being held, Cortese said — not just for presenting an opposing viewpoint or speaking sharply.

And if somehow the legislation fails in practice, Cortese vowed, “we’ll fix it.”

“We’ll fix it regardless of who comes forward to expose those flaws,” he said. “Republicans or Democrats or ‘decline to states’ or people who don’t even vote but want to be able to come in and complain.”

Protests, sometimes rowdy and rude, have been a fixture for decades in the council chambers of big cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. But in recent years, the practice has increasingly spread to small communities — the new state law stemmed from threats posed to members of the Los Gatos Town Council — and once-innocuous boards overseeing libraries, historical preservation and the like.

School board meetings, especially, have become battle zones in the fights over masks, remote learning and curriculum.

Blame it on the collective nervous breakdown the country seems to have suffered during three years of pandemic. Blame it on the bad behavior modeled by politicians at the national level and the inclination to turn every matter, however small, into a litmus test of red-versus-blue loyalties.

Robb Korinke, a consultant on local government who has spent two decades attending and monitoring city council meetings, also blames social media.

“Twenty years ago, you had a gadfly who knew they would get themselves on local-access cable,” Korinke said. “It’s a different thing when you know you can go viral. That’s really amped up the performative nature of a lot of this stuff.”

The difficulty, of course, is knowing when and where to draw the line between disruption and dissent.

Some argue that shutting down a public meeting is itself a form of protest, signaling not only discontent but a deeper belief that a city council, school board or other governing body is so ineffectual, so inept or out of touch, that the only remediation is to cease its operation.

But Korinke poses a reasonable question: “Does your dissent override another person’s opportunity to speak?” Put another way, why should the loudest voices drown out all others?

“Bullying and intimidating behavior is not only coarsening discussion but having a chilling effect,” Korinke observed. “It prevents the average citizen from being able to participate in those meetings, or even wanting to. ... We wouldn’t allow that kind of behavior in a courtroom. So why do we allow it at city council meetings?”

By seeking to rein in the worst excesses without stifling protest, California’s new public meeting law strikes a welcome middle ground.

No one wants a bunch of sheep mindlessly doing whatever their government tells them. But that’s no reason to act like a jackass.

Patti’s positions on the Affordable Care Act and healthcare access aren’t clear. Under accomplishments” on his campaign website, he mentions work on a Veterans Administration hospital in French Camp as well as working “with state and local leaders to enhance Rx labeling and package disclosures.”



In 2018, Patti was arrested after a collision on Interstate 5. San Joaquin Superior Court records show that he was charged with a misdemeanor DUI and that state attorney general’s office amended the criminal complaint to a reckless-driving misdemeanor. Patti, who said he accidentally took the wrong medication, pleaded no contest. Records show he was sentenced to conditional probation for one year.

latimes,COVID,9377,latimes,"The Supreme Court on Thursday refused an emergency appeal to immediately revive President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan, but agreed to rule early next year on its legality.

The justices left in place an appeals court ruling that has put the program on hold.

The decision is a temporary setback for the administration but not a defeat for its plan to forgive student loans of up to $20,000 for as many as 20 million borrowers.

Anticipating such a move by the court, the administration last week extended its pause for borrowers to resume making monthly repayments, at least until June 30 of next year. By then, the high court will likely have handed down a ruling.

But Biden and his lawyers face an uphill battle against a conservative court that is skeptical of government agencies claiming a broad power that was not clearly approved by Congress.

At issue is whether the COVID-19 pandemic and the national emergency declared by then-President Trump in March 2020 authorizes the Education Department to go beyond its pause in repayments and forgive some or all of the student loans held by those earning less than $125,000 a year or up to $250,000 for a married couple.

Twice in the past year, the court’s conservatives rejected Biden’s use of the pandemic to extend his regulatory powers.

The justices in a 6-3 decision ended a nationwide moratorium on housing evictions and said it “strains credulity” to believe Congress had given such authority to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

They also struck down a Labor Department rule that would have required large employers to enforce vaccine mandate for their employees.

The administration’s student loan forgiveness plan is based on the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, or HEROES Act, which Congress adopted without debate shortly after the start of the Iraq war.

It said the Education Secretary may “waive or modify” a student aid program if “necessary in connection with a war or other military operation or national emergency.”

The aim was to ensure that “affected individuals” such as soldiers and National Guard troops “are not placed in a worse position financially” from being called to serve. Their loans were not canceled.

The law also said an “affected individual” includes anyone who “resides or is employed in an area that is declared a disaster area by any federal, state, or local official in connection with a national emergency.”

Biden’s lawyers argued that those who live in the United States or abroad qualify as an “affected individual” under the law because the COVID-19 pandemic is global in scope.

Six Republican state attorneys sued and argued Congress never authorized the government to forgive student loans at a cost of more than $400 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

They cited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who last year said “it would take an act of Congress, not an executive order, to cancel student loan debt. People think that the president of the United States has the power of debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay, but he does not have that power.”

Bills were introduced in Congress to authorize loan forgiveness, but no action was taken on them.

A question facing those attempting to block Biden in court is whether they have legal standing. It was not certain that any person or states could claim they had standing to sue because they would be harmed by the president’s plan to forgive some loans. Taxpayers who object to a spending program do not have standing, and several suits were dismissed for that reason.

Lawyers for Republican-led states argued that the state agencies that handle student loans will have reduced revenue if large numbers of loans are erased, and this in turn will reduce the state’s revenue.

A federal judge in St. Louis dismissed the states’ claims based on a lack of standing, but the 8th Circuit Court disagreed and issued an nationwide injunction that put Biden’s plan on hold.

In a 3-0 decision handed down on Nov. 14, the judges cited the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority, which faces “an unanticipated financial downturn” and “presents a threatened financial harm to the state.”

Four days later, Biden’s Solicitor Gen. Elizabeth B. Prelogar filed an emergency appeal asking the Supreme Court to set aside the injunction and allow the Education Department to begin forgiving student loans. She said the states do not have standing to sue because their claims rest on “pure speculation” about future revenues.

She argued in Biden vs. Nebraska that the president’s “plan falls squarely within the plain text” of the law. “Indeed, the entire purpose of the HEROES Act is to authorize the [Education] Secretary to grant student-loan-related relief to at-risk borrowers because of a national emergency — precisely what the secretary did here.”

Rather than decide solely on whether to allow the forgiveness plan to proceed while lower courts heard the dispute, the Supreme Court now will take the case directly, with arguments set for February.",COVID
latimes,COVID,9373,latimes,"The Biden administration is treading lightly in response to demonstrations in China by citizens angry over the country’s harsh COVID-19 restrictions, drawing criticism from Republicans and democracy advocates who say the White House should act more forcefully.

The protests, which broke out across China over the weekend, were triggered by the deaths of 10 people in an apartment building fire in the country’s far west last week. Residents blamed China’s strict “zero-COVID” strategy, which includes shutdowns of entire cities and towns when coronavirus cases are detected, for trapping people in their rooms and slowing the ability of firefighters to respond.

Public protests are extremely rare in China and have excited human rights and democracy advocates searching for any signs that President Xi Jinping is losing his grip on power. But so far, most outside analysts and foreign policy experts have cautioned that Xi will probably be able to contain the demonstrations in short order.

Relations between Washington and Beijing were extraordinarily tense even before the protests, and the Biden administration may be reluctant to condemn Xi after the presidents met in person for what U.S. officials described as a positive interaction just two weeks ago. U.S. officials are hoping that encounter could slow the decline in the two countries’ relations, and worry that condemning Xi could jeopardize any progress.

“The White House supports the right of peaceful protest … around the world,” National Security Council spokesman John F. Kirby said Monday. “People should be allowed the right to assemble and peacefully protest policies or laws.”

He stopped short, however, of criticizing Beijing’s heavy-handed efforts to crack down on demonstrations. He and other White House officials did express skepticism over China’s “zero-COVID strategy” and whether it would ultimately succeed in stopping the spread of the disease in the country where it was first detected.

“We’re watching this closely as you might expect that we would,” Kirby said.

Critics in the GOP and other conservative circles accused the administration of failing to act forcefully to take advantage of a potentially pivotal moment.

“Pitiful,” tweeted Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). “At a potentially historic inflection point, Dems shill for the CCP [Chinese Communist Party]. “It’s almost as if Biden wishes he was driving a tank in Tiananmen Square….”

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) said the administration’s reaction to the protests is “nothing short of cowardly” and accused President Biden of failing to “stand up to the CCP and stand in solidarity with the Chinese people.”

Western governments should do far more to support the protesters, including issuing “unequivocal and specific warnings to China about the consequences of any bloody crackdown,” Jianli Yang, a former Tiananmen Square protester, wrote in a Monday op-ed published in the Washington Post.

Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy organization, advised all governments speaking about the unrest in China to go further than the Biden administration has so far — to not only “express support for people’s rights to free speech and assembly,” as the White House did, but also “urge the Chinese authorities not to suppress the protests,” which it did not.

But groups of Chinese people “shouting on a road in Shanghai,” where some went so far as to demand that Xi step down, and the other rallies do not a revolution make, said Robert Daly, a former U.S. diplomat in China who now heads the Kissinger Institute on China at the Wilson Center think tank.

“People are eager to see echoes of Tiananmen,” Daly said, referring to the 1989 pro-democracy protests in the Beijing square and subsequent crackdown, “but I don’t see it. There is national discontent with the prices of COVID. But this is not a national movement.”

The demonstrations are overwhelmingly the product of pandemic-related restrictions that have, for periods, kept millions of people confined to home, banned from travel, unable to work. Ending those practices is the one unifying demand of the wave of protests.

“When demonstrators say, ‘No to [COVID-19] tests, we want freedom,’ they are not talking about Bill of Rights freedom,” Daly said. “They are talking about returning to the kinds of freedom of movement they had” before the pandemic.

In a written analysis, Craig Singleton, a senior fellow specializing in China at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, agreed that the protests were unlikely to “seriously challenge” the authority of the Communist Party even though the “tenuous trust” between party and people is “starting to fray.”

Daly and other analysts said Xi will probably be able to manage the current crisis with some cosmetic adjustments to the COVID-19 policies or local measures that would ease pressure in limited areas, in addition to increased repression to isolate protest outbreaks and detain instigators.

The crescendo of protests now is due in part to expectations among many Chinese that COVID-19 restrictions were going to be eased after the 20th Communist Party conference in which Xi cemented his unprecedented third term as the country’s leader. But a spate of new cases brought additional lockdowns instead.

Some experts cautioned that if the Biden administration were to lend full-throated support to demonstrators, the Xi government would then brand U.S. officials as instruments of outside forces attempting to destabilize China, a frequent trope used by Beijing to discredit dissidents.

Xi has a “remarkable repertoire to crack down and [exert] control,” said Carla Freeman, a veteran China expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace. These include “mild-mannered” tactics such as having police seize and erase photos from the phones of demonstrators, and the more drastic measure of moving riot-gear security agents into position near rally sites.

“He will ease restrictions where possible, crack down where needed and manage where he can” with tactics from subtle intimidation to violence, Freeman said.

On Monday, the Chinese government appeared to already be moving aggressively to crush the protest movement. Few demonstrations were reported that day, but social media posts described numerous arrests.",COVID
latimes,Climate Change,9353,latimes,"President Biden is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week on the Indonesian island of Bali, their first in-person summit since Biden arrived in the White House.

The stakes are always high at superpower summits, and this one is no exception. After months of near-collisions over Taiwan, both governments appear to want to lower the temperature. Another good sign: Earlier this month, Xi publicly admonished his ally Vladimir Putin to stop threatening Ukraine with Russian nuclear weapons.

But other grounds for optimism are few. U.S. officials are carefully keeping expectations low; their main goal, one aide said last week, is merely “to build a floor under the relationship.” Even that modest outcome isn’t guaranteed.

“The U.S. side wants to demonstrate that [the two countries] are not locked in a downward spiral,” said Evan Medeiros, a former China advisor to President Obama. “I think both sides are going to be able to say the right things to stabilize the relationship, but none of the underlying issues are going to be solved.”

U.S.-China summits once tried to focus on areas where the two sides could cooperate, such as climate change and North Korea. But those dreams of collaboration are mostly a memory now: As China’s economic and military power has grown, the two countries have increasingly seen each other as threats.

Two especially difficult issues stand in the way of progress.

One is familiar — the standoff over Taiwan, the U.S.-backed island that China claims as part of its national territory. The other is newer: A U.S. ban on sales of advanced technology to Beijing has touched off a “semiconductor war.”

The United States and China have long been at loggerheads over Taiwan, but over the last year, tensions have grown sharper. China has escalated its military incursions in the waters and airspace around the island. Biden has responded by declaring that if Taiwan is attacked, the United States will defend it with military force — toughening a U.S. policy that was once ambiguous.

The standoff could easily turn more dangerous. Taiwan’s next presidential election campaign begins next year, and some candidates are expected to call for a formal declaration of independence — a move that China has said would cross an impermissible “red line.”

If Republicans take over in the U.S. House of Representatives as expected, they are likely to push for tougher pro-Taiwan policies, including increased military sales to the island. Keeping this precarious standoff from sliding toward war won’t be easy.

The semiconductor war is a new, more intense version of an old problem — the U.S. complaint that China steals American technology and uses it to modernize Chinese military hardware.

Last month, after years of largely ineffectual regulation, the Biden administration imposed sweeping new limits on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China — a step aimed explicitly at a core component of Xi’s strategy for speeding Beijing’s rise as a scientific, economic and military competitor.

China has responded with angry protests, calling the U.S. export controls the equivalent of an economic blockade. But it has not retaliated with any equivalent trade measures; experts suspect Xi does not want to take any actions that would risk harming the sputtering Chinese economy.

“My guess is that Xi will raise that issue at the summit,” said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund, a U.S. think tank. “He’ll say that it’s evidence that the U.S. is pursuing a strategy of containment against China. … But I don’t think there’s any way forward on it. If anything, the administration wants to use the same tool in areas beyond semiconductors.”

U.S. officials say they still hope to restart talks with China on areas where the two countries might be able to cooperate, like food security in the developing world or climate change.

At a more basic level, they hope to revive U.S. ideas for “confidence-building measures” including a long-stalled proposal for a “hot line” communications link between the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii and China’s Eastern Command.

But even those modest steps don’t look attainable this week.

“Opening communications channels with China doesn’t really solve other problems,” Medeiros added. “It’s unlikely to shift the trajectory [of the relationship], which is toward intensified competition.”

In the tradition of superpower summits, Biden and Xi doubtless hope to declare their meeting a success — if only by the hard-to-measure standard of stabilizing U.S.-China relations.

Even if they do, the two countries still face far more opportunities for conflict than cooperation. The U.S.-China problem is likely to get worse before it gets better.",Climate Change
latimes,Climate Change,9260,latimes,"Last fall, after state and local governments flushed more than $200 million down the toilet for a failed effort to chase Gov. Gavin Newsom from office, there was all sorts of talk about reforming California’s recall process.

Lawmakers held forth, hearings took place, academics weighed in and the state’s independent oversight commission gave the Legislature recommendations.

Then nothing much happened.

“Most of it, I think, is because the average legislator — and we’re the ones who are going to put this on the ballot through a constitutional amendment — isn’t going to be recalled,” said state Sen. Josh Newman, a Fullerton Democrat who was recalled in 2018 before winning back his seat in 2020. “So it doesn’t have the same level of urgency, especially as time goes by.”

Lawmakers also respond to what they’re hearing, or not, from the people they represent. And, let’s face it, voters dealing with soaring inflation, a pandemic, the skyrocketing cost of gas and fears of a recession don’t consider tinkering with California’s recall rules a matter of particular urgency.

But the system needs to be fixed, or soon enough California could face another distracting and expensive attempt to subvert the election process.

How pointless was the attempted recall of Newsom? Essentially, it amounted to a re-running of the 2018 gubernatorial election, which the Democrat won with 61.9% support. The same share, 61.9%, voted against his removal.

The way it now works, a recall election is conducted in two parts. Voters are asked whether a lawmaker should be removed, and if so, who should replace them. That second question allows the top vote-getter to take office even if they fall well short of majority support — which is why outnumbered Republicans found it so enticing to take on the governor.

The presence of that second question allows a political minority to try “to get out of a special election what you obviously couldn’t get out of a normal election,” said Newman, who has introduced legislation to change things so only one question appears on the ballot — a straight up-or-down vote on the recall.

“We [would] still have the option of removing a corrupt or malfeasant elected official,” said Newman, who was ousted after voting to raise gas taxes and vehicle fees. (Though really it was about Republicans denying Democrats their supermajority in the state Senate.) “But we’ve removed the kind of perverse incentive that has led to all this partisan warfare.”

Under his legislation, if a governor were ousted during the first two years of his or her term, the lieutenant governor would take over until a special election to choose a replacement. If the governor had only two years left to serve, the lieutenant governor would finish the term.

The proposal leaves a lot of unsolved problems, but as Newman suggested, change is hard. He once hoped to put his reform measure before voters in November, but legislative inertia makes that extremely unlikely. His goal now is 2024.

The recall is a hand-me-down from the progressive era, one of the tools given citizens to hold their elected leaders accountable. Repeated polls have shown that Californians, by an overwhelming margin, like holding that bludgeon in their hand. (In the last few months, voters in San Francisco booted their district attorney and three members of their school board.)

But the 20th century reform has proven ripe for 21st century abuse, and the failed attempt by out-of-power Republicans to drive Newsom from office — nine months before he was to face voters anyway — highlighted several of its flaws.

Of 19 states that allow their governor to be recalled, California is by far the most permissive, with an exceedingly low signature requirement. And there’s no prerequisite — no requirement for evidence of malfeasance, corruption or criminality — to try to force an incumbent from office.

In the whole history of this country, there have been just four gubernatorial recall elections. Half those occurred in California within the last two decades, which seems like no coincidence given the ease of forcing a vote, the bounty paid to collect signatures and the backdrop of increasingly stark political polarization.

California’s independent oversight agency, the Little Hoover Commission, has recommended several changes. (And here things get a bit wonky, which is another reason that reform efforts appear to have stalled. Process doesn’t inspire great passion, which is one reason you don’t see masses of demonstrators descending on Sacramento chanting, “No bifurcated ballots!”)

One proposal calls for increasing the signature requirement from 12% of the vote in the prior gubernatorial election to 10% of the state’s registered voters, thereby raising the threshold to force a recall. Another would prohibit recalls undertaken during the first 90 days and last six months of an officeholder’s term.

Newman said various remedies are worth discussing, but warned that “there’s a risk of trying to do too much.”

“The more complicated you make it,” he said, “the easier it is for people to obfuscate” the issue and keep anything from getting done.

Still, a revamp of the recall is badly needed, even if it may not be the most pressing issue of the moment. It’s important that our elections have integrity, and that people respect the outcomes and don’t try to overturn them simply because they’re unhappy with the results.

latimes,Climate Change,9289,latimes,"A senior aide to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti will be appointed the first ever U.S. State Department special envoy for linking local governments to national foreign policy, sources told The Times.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken is expected Monday to name Nina Hachigian as the country’s first special representative for subnational diplomacy.

“Subnational” diplomacy refers to government entities at local levels — cities and counties instead of nations.

Hachigian, 55, has served as the Los Angeles deputy mayor for international affairs under Garcetti since 2017. Before that she was a State Department diplomat assigned to the leading Asian alliance, the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN.

The idea behind the new office, officials say, is to connect issues with local impact, such as climate change, to international programs, sharing information, ideas and money.

“Communities, cities, and states are coming up with some of the most innovative and creative ideas for tackling many of the global challenges we face,” Hachigian said in an interview ahead of her appointment. “It is vital that we at the State Department harness the ingenuity of our local communities as we strive to build a foreign policy for all Americans.”

U.S. officials say the new office is meant to further connect foreign policy to middle-class America, a goal President Biden has stated since his election. Presumably it is also a way to shield foreign policy from those who would argue that domestic issues should come first at the expense of looking abroad.

“A central task for us,” Hachigian said, “will be bringing the benefits of our foreign policy to the local level.”

Blinken, in a statement to be released later Monday, said cities, counties and states across the United States are on the “front lines of many of our most pressing global issues, including climate change, economic justice and democratic renewal.”

For example, when former President Trump attempted to back away from efforts to combat climate change, it was local or regional entities — such as California — that persisted in adopting programs to contain waste, pollution and the explosion in climate destruction.

“U.S. cities and states are incubators for innovative and novel ideas that tackle global challenges, and the department should harness these solutions,” Blinken said. Hachigian’s new office will lead and coordinate those efforts, he added.

Her appointment comes as Garcetti’s nomination to a diplomatic post has languished in the Senate for months. Biden nominated Garcetti in July 2021 to be the U.S. ambassador to India.

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his nomination in January, but the outgoing mayor’s confirmation has yet to see a floor vote — and it’s unclear whether it will.

The 50-50 Senate is in recess until after election day, and Congress will return with a host of other priorities in the lame-duck period, including a government funding package, a same-sex marriage bill and election reform legislation.",Climate Change
latimes,Climate Change,9267,latimes,"Democrats are on defense across the country in this year’s midterm elections but appear to believe some of their best chances for flipping GOP congressional districts are in California.

Five of six candidates added to their “Red to Blue” program on Monday are in this state, according to an announcement by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

“The Democratic Party is stronger because of candidates like these who have joined the fight to represent their community,” committee Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney said in a statement. “Unlike their extreme Republican opponents, these candidates will fight for their district, work to protect reproductive freedom, battle to lower prices on groceries, gas and prescription drug costs, and seek commonsense solutions to combat gun violence terrorizing communities.”

Candidates must show viability by hitting donation goals as well as having robust campaigns and field operations to qualify for the committee’s Red to Blue program, which provides fundraising, organizing and other support.

Many of the California Democrats in the program are running in districts made more favorable in the redrawing of congressional maps after the U.S. census. Redistricting, which is conducted by an independent panel in California, occurs once every decade, and was especially fraught last year because the state lost a congressional seat for the first time in its history.

Among the candidates added to the program Monday are two competing for open seats: Dr. Kermit Jones is running against GOP Assemblyman Kevin Kiley in a sprawling district that spans much of eastern California; Assemblyman Adam Gray is vying with Republican nursery owner John Duarte in the Central Valley.

Also added to the Red to Blue program are former Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is challenging GOP Rep. Mike Garcia in northern Los Angeles County; Dr. Asif Mahmood, who is vying with Republican Rep. Young Kim in an Orange County-centric district; and former federal prosecutor Will Rollins, who hopes to defeat Rep. Ken Calvert — the longest-serving GOP member of California’s congressional delegation — in Riverside County.

The sixth candidate added by the committee is Illinois meteorologist Eric Sorensen, who is competing with Republican attorney Esther Joy King.

Before Monday’s announcement, the only Californians on the list had been Navy Reserve intelligence officer Jay Chen, who is trying to defeat GOP Rep. Michelle Steel in an Orange County-based district, and Assemblyman Rudy Salas, who is vying against Republican Rep. David Valadao in the Central Valley.

Californians now account for more than one-fifth of the 33 candidates in the program.

Republicans have a similar program for promising candidates who meet fundraising and organizational benchmarks. Californians Kiley and Duarte are part of the “Young Guns” program, as are San Joaquin County Supervisor Tom Patti, who is running against Rep. Josh Harder in the Central Valley; former Orange County GOP Chairman Scott Baugh, who is vying with Rep. Katie Porter in Orange County; and former San Juan Capistrano Mayor Brian Maryott, who is challenging Rep. Mike Levin in a district that straddles Orange and San Diego counties.

Republicans need a net gain of a handful of seats to take control of the House. Democrats are facing headwinds going into the November election, with the historic trend that a president’s party loses ground in the first midterm compounded by President Biden’s low approval ratings and economic challenges including inflation and high gas prices. But the party is hopeful that recent Supreme Court rulings, notably the overturning of federal protection for abortion access, could help motivate voters, particularly suburban women in places like Orange County.

Some of the candidates Democrats are aiming to highlight, however, are behind in funding, according to disclosures filed Friday.

Smith is viewed as one of the party’s best chances of flipping a district — she lost her 2020 race with Garcia by 333 votes, and after the every-decade redrawing of congressional maps, their district has grown more Democratic. But she ended June with $306,000 in the bank, compared with Garcia’s $1.7 million, according to fundraising disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday.

Democrats have grown excited by Rollins’ prospects against Calvert, notably because the district has grown more liberal with the inclusion of cities such as Palm Springs. But Calvert had nearly $1.4 million in his campaign coffers at the end of June, compared with Rollins’ $479,000.

Gray, with $402,000 in cash on hand, had slightly more than Duarte.

In two districts that favor Republicans, Democrats reported significant money as they prepare for the fall. Jones had more than $595,000 in the bank at the end of June, more than three times as much as Kiley. And Mahmood had a little more than $1.2 million, a little shy of Kim, who had to spend millions of dollars to fight off a primary challenger from her right flank.",Climate Change
latimes,Climate Change,9372,latimes,"If you’ve been yearning for a preview of the battle for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, the place to be last weekend was Las Vegas, where the Republican Jewish Coalition held what some attendees cheekily called a “kosher cattle call” for potential candidates.

Former Vice President Mike Pence was there. So were former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. Former President Trump appeared by video — only a few days before dining with two of the country’s best-known antisemites.

The biggest buzz of the weekend, though, was attached to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the rising 44-year-old star of the conservative firmament, fresh from a landslide reelection.

Around the country, DeSantis noted, many Republicans fell short in this year’s midterm elections. Florida, he said, offered “a blueprint for success.”

DeSantis isn’t running for president yet, at least not officially. He has told supporters to “chill out” until Florida’s legislative session ends in May.

But the presence of so many non-candidates at a Las Vegas cattle call showed that the contest is already underway; that Trump, the only declared candidate, isn’t getting much deference from the party he once led; and that, at least for the moment, DeSantis appears to be the challenger most likely to take the former president down.

Polls don’t mean much at this early stage. At this point ahead of the 2016 GOP race, the top contenders in polls were former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

What the polls can say, however, is that most Republican voters have focused on three names: Trump, DeSantis and Pence. Six months ago, most of them didn’t know who DeSantis was.

“It’s too early to call anyone a front-runner,” said Alex Conant, a strategist for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the 2016 campaign. “But you’d rather be Ron DeSantis than anyone else in the field. He’s made as good a first impression on Republican voters as anyone in decades.”

DeSantis has several things going for him, including the adulation of Fox News, which treats him as a front-runner and has begun casting Trump as yesterday’s man.

DeSantis has used that attention to build a national following as a conservative champion in a multifront culture war on not only traditional GOP issues like abortion and immigration but newer targets like antiracism education in public schools (pilloried by DeSantis and others as “critical race theory”), transgender surgery for minors (DeSantis wants to outlaw it) and a crusade against what he calls “woke banks.”

The governor has proposed legislation to prohibit banks from discriminating against customers for their religious, political or social beliefs. (Conservative activists are convinced that banks run by liberals won’t lend to right-wing organizations.)

His unifying theme is opposition to what he sees as a liberal power elite: not only Democratic politicians but “globalist” big businesses, big tech and “leftist media.”

“We are not afraid to buck the discredited ruling class,” he said in a recent speech. “This is an agenda that is trying to render the conservative half of the country second-class citizens.”

This is Trumpism 2.0: a pugnacious, populist conservatism rooted in resentment but updated, more disciplined and free of the self-absorption of Trump’s version.

“He’s Trump without the craziness,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.

Whether that’s enough to carry DeSantis to the nomination remains to be seen.

“There’s a lot we don’t know yet,” one GOP strategist told me. “He hasn’t really been tested on a national stage. We don’t know how he’ll react to tough opposition. We don’t know how he’ll perform in debates. The Mike Tyson rule applies: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”

And being a front-runner may not be as cushy as it seems. Other candidates are more likely to see you as a target, since you block their way to the top.

“There’s a danger of cannibalism,” Conant said. “In 2016, a lot of other candidates went after Rubio from Day One. Will they start going after DeSantis this time?”

Unlike 2016, in the coming round of Republican primaries no one is likely to underestimate the former president or be surprised by his bulldozer tactics. With their party’s future in their hands, would-be nominees will face a choice.

They can repeat the pattern of 2016, when Trump’s rivals avoided attacking him and savaged one another instead.

Or they can take a page from the Democrats of 2020, who coalesced around Joe Biden once it became clear that their race was headed for a showdown between him and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Biden, who had nearly been counted out of the race a month earlier, is in the White House today. That’s a lesson Republican contenders may want to heed.",Climate Change
latimes,Climate Change,9225,latimes,"Vice President Kamala Harris plans to visit a San Bernardino fire station Friday to announce the federal government will provide California $600 million to help the state recover from a historically severe wildfire season while highlighting plans to spend $5 billion more to address the dangers posed by fires, an administration official said.

The event is part of the Biden administration’s effort to showcase a $1-trillion bipartisan infrastructure law that the president signed in November. President Biden said during a news conference marking his first year in office on Wednesday that he wanted to spend more time selling the administration’s achievements in the face of low poll numbers and recent setbacks on his agenda, including the failure this week to pass a major voting rights bill championed by Harris.

Harris’ speech in San Bernardino will be the first to feature the infrastructure bill’s $5 billion allocation to combat, prevent and prepare for wildfires. Last year’s wildfire season was among the worst in California’s history, with fires scorching nearly 2.6 million acres.

Harris plans to spend the weekend at her home in Los Angeles and then speak in Milwaukee on Monday about the administration’s plans to replace lead pipes, another issue that will get a spending boost from the infrastructure bill.

The $600 million in disaster money, part of a national commitment to spend $1.3 billion, will be used by local communities to clean up hazardous materials, restore forests and repair infrastructure damaged by wildfires, an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview Harris’ speech.

Harris, who was born in California and spent the bulk of her career there, has sought to position herself as an administration point person on wildfires. While serving in the Senate, she wrote legislation to create grants for low-income and high-risk communities to get help in preventing fires. Such grants made it into the infrastructure bill and are designed to help communities draw up plans and clear brush in buffers between towns and forests. Harris has also talked about using satellite technology to help track fire risks and active fires.

In her speech Friday, she intends to draw a connection between climate change and the conditions that have made fires more frequent and ferocious, according to the official. Some of the money in the bill will pay for landscaping programs, for example, that are aimed at resisting drought and protecting wildlife habitats.

The administration calls that part of its two-pronged approach on climate change. But Biden has not had as much success in addressing the second, more expensive prong aimed at preventing temperatures from rising.

His signature $1.8-trillion spending plan would have provided money for a host of social spending and environmental programs. It died last month when Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia said he would not support it. Because all 50 Republican senators oppose the plan, Biden needs support from all 50 Democrats and independents.

Biden said Wednesday that he hoped to revive at least some portion of his plan, pointing to environmental and energy spending specifically.",Climate Change
latimes,Economy,9305,latimes,"Less than four weeks before the midterm elections that will decide control of Congress, President Biden is scheduled to hit the campaign trail in Los Angeles on Thursday, where his lone public appearance will be alongside mayoral candidate Karen Bass.

Biden’s four-day Western swing, which began in Colorado’s high country Wednesday, is as noteworthy for where he isn’t going as for where he is. The trip, built around a high-dollar fundraiser for Democratic House candidates in Los Angeles on Thursday night, will not include travel to Arizona or Nevada, two Western states with closely contested Senate races that may tip the balance of power in Washington.

Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, the only vulnerable Democratic senator appearing with Biden during this rare trip out West, welcomed Biden to his state Wednesday largely because the president was taking action that the lawmaker had been pushing for. At an event high in the Rocky Mountains, Biden created his first new national monument at Camp Hale, a World War II-era training camp now protected from development by oil and gas companies.

Bennet, speaking at Camp Hale, focused solely on the designation of the monument, telling the president that “Colorado will be forever grateful” for protecting the area. Biden, who followed the senator at the presidential lectern, credited Bennet as the key individual who “made this finally happen.”

If Democrats are somewhat squeamish about embracing Biden in the final month of the campaign, it’s hardly a historical aberration, as incumbent presidents have almost always faced stiffed political head winds — and seen their party lose seats — in their first midterm election.

Polls indicate that Biden is somewhat less polarizing than his three most recent predecessors. But Democrats seem to be avoiding him anyway.

“Biden isn’t a polarizing figure either personally or in terms of policy. There isn’t something that makes him a flashpoint for voters,” said Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster in Washington. “But instead they’re looking at the broader landscape and where things are at, especially with the economy. The key question about this year is: Will voters look at how far we’ve come? Or how far we have to go?”

That Democrats have any chance at all to retain the party’s narrow congressional majorities is a reflection of the unique and volatile political environment.

The Supreme Court’s historic ruling in June overturning Roe vs. Wade has galvanized women across the usual political divide, leading to a surge in voter registration and bolstering Biden’s effort to characterize Republicans as extremists. This year’s House committee hearings revisiting the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection and the revelation that the FBI had to seize sensitive classified national security documents from President Trump’s Florida estate have only helped Biden’s case.

But the complex political environment, and an electorate that remains primarily concerned about inflation, have made it hard for pollsters and election prognosticators to determine which way the winds are actually blowing.

“There’s just a lot swirling in the atmosphere, and you don’t know where it’s all going to land,” Hart said. For Democrats on the November ballot, “there’s something to sell,” he continued. “But you have to get voters over the hump. There are real accomplishments, but some voters won’t be able to see them through the more immediate concerns about inflation and uncertainty.”

When Biden makes Democrats’ case, he often emphasizes major legislative wins of the last two years — a pandemic relief bill, bipartisan infrastructure overhaul and a package of investments that will reduce prescription drug costs and combat climate change — and presents Democratic governance as the moderate alternative to an extreme Republican Party defined by Trump and his acolytes.

Emmy Ruiz, the White House political director, said the administration’s accomplishments enable Biden and Democrats to make an unusually strong affirmative argument to voters. That’s a stark difference from 2010, when the recent passage of the Affordable Care Act had Democrats on the defensive and ultimately led to a devastating midterm election.

“We have a real record to run on,” Ruiz said. “We have real tangible outcomes that we have delivered for the American people, real bipartisan outcomes that we’ve delivered for the American people.”

It’s unclear that the landmark legislation will be much of a factor for voters who are more activated by abortion, extremism or the economy. Biden has largely shied away from focusing on other efforts aimed at lifting Democratic turnout: student loan debt forgiveness and clemency for federal marijuana offenses. His ability to focus the electorate on his accomplishments — or much of anything — is limited. But his low-key style and unobtrusiveness leave candidates the space to define their own races, his persona not so toxic as to inspire more Republicans to turn out just to vote against him.

“He is not a polarizing figure. He is somebody who is known for his ability to bring people together,” Ruiz said. “Look at the 2018 midterms: President Biden went to states that most Democrats were not traveling to, at least national Democrats, and he was requested to go do so. That has been one of his signature abilities, to be able to travel to places where other Democrats cannot.”

But even after two years of significant accomplishments, Biden isn’t going near the most closely contested battlegrounds. As the Republican National Committee noted in a memo this week, Biden has concentrated his campaigning in traditionally blue states: Maryland, New York and now California and Oregon.

“The reality is that Democrats are struggling to shore up key races,” said Emma Vaughn, the RNC’s press secretary. “Biden now finds himself traveling to places that went for him by more than 10 points in the last election.”",Economy
latimes,Economy,9245,latimes,"With April 15, the traditional tax day, upon us, a new California poll shows that the share of state voters who believe they pay too much has grown.

Nearly two-thirds of California voters say the state and federal income taxes they pay are too high, according to a new UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Times.

That share is up 10 percentage points compared with a similar statewide poll taken six years ago.

The discontent about taxes comes at a time when many Californians feel economic stress. Roughly 4 in 10 voters said in the poll that their finances were worse than a year ago, compared with 2 in 10 who said they were better off.

But the growing number of voters who say they pay too much doesn’t necessarily herald another big tax revolt of the sort the state spawned in the late 1970s and again in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Given a list of major issues facing the state and asked to name two that were most urgent, only 15% of voters picked taxes, putting the topic in the middle of the pack. Housing affordability topped the list, cited by 31% of voters, followed by homelessness; crime and public safety; gasoline prices; and climate change and the environment.

In addition, voters in recent years have approved a number of state and local tax-increase measures. Since 2001, voters in California have approved about three-quarters of city general tax measures, more than half of county measures and about 8 in 10 school bond measures, according to analysis by Michael Coleman, an expert on local finance.

Concern about taxes is much more common among conservatives than liberals. In the current survey, 83% of Republicans, compared with 54% of Democrats and 66% of nonpartisan voters, said they thought their families paid too much in taxes. The rest mostly said the levy was “about right.” Almost no one says they should be paying more.

As other polls have shown, conservatives are also more likely to believe that California’s taxes are the highest or near the highest in the nation.

The state consistently ranks about 10th in the nation in the share of personal income that goes to taxes — behind perennial high-tax jurisdictions such as New York, Vermont, Minnesota and Hawaii.

California has some of the nation’s highest income tax rates on top earners, but the state exempts a large share of the population from the income tax, and its property and sales taxes are lower than some other jurisdictions.

The state is projecting a large budget surplus this year, and Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislators are debating proposals to give Californians a gas-tax rebate.

The UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll, supervised by polling director Mark DiCamillo, surveyed 8,676 California registered voters March 29-April 5. The poll was administered online in English and Spanish. The estimated sampling error is plus or minus 2 percentage points. Full question wording and topline results are available on the Berkeley IGS website.",Economy
latimes,Economy,9370,latimes,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday denied President Trump’s plea to shield his tax returns from being turned over to a House committee.

The decision came in a one-line order with no dissents.

The court’s action has the effect of upholding a long-standing request from House Ways and Means Committee Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) for six years of Trump’s tax returns. Neal acted under a law that says the Internal Revenue Service “shall furnish” the committee chairman with “any return or return information” that he requested in writing.

The law does not authorize a public release of any tax returns, including those of a former president. Rather, the Ways and Means Committee is authorized to examine the returns in confidence to consider new or revised legislation.

But the long legal battle is ending just as the Democrats are about to lose control of the House, raising doubts about whether Neal’s Republican successor will continue the effort.

Trump and his lawyers had already lost before a Trump-appointed federal district judge and an appeals court panel with two Republican appointees.

Trump, who last week announced he will run for president in 2024, filed an emergency appeal asking the justices to intervene and block the IRS from turning over his tax records to the committee.

Trump’s legal team argued that doing so would “undermine the separation of powers” and leave all future presidents exposed to having their private tax returns exposed by political opponents in Congress.

“No prior Congress has used its legislative power to obtain and expose the private financial information of a president,” they said in their final appeal Nov.14.

Moreover, they argued that time had run out on House Democrats.

“The old Congress has only a few days left on its legislative calendar. Though a few days is enough time to improperly expose the most sensitive documents of its chief political rival, it’s not enough time to properly study, draft, debate, or pass legislation,” the Trump legal team said.

Two years ago, the Supreme Court handed down a split decision when it considered two cases involving Trump’s taxes.

In the first, the justices cleared the way for New York prosecutors to obtain Trump’s returns, and those records played a role in civil and criminal charges that were brought against his real estate organization.

In the second case, the court blocked subpoenas from three House committees that sought financial records from the then-president, his family and his businesses.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. cited the “separation of powers” and questioned whether House Democrats had legitimate legislative reasons for seeking personal information from the chief executive.

Trump’s lawyers cited that decision in Trump vs. Mazars in their suit to block Neal from obtaining the now ex-president’s records from the firm that prepared his businesses’ taxes.

Since 1977, presidents had routinely released their tax returns, but Trump refused to do so. And though the IRS had a policy of carefully auditing the returns of the president, Neal said the committee had doubts about whether the agency had looked into Trump’s far-flung holdings.

“Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Trump owned a complex web of businesses, engaged in business activities internationally and had a history of aggressive tax avoidance (as he has boasted),” House lawyers told the court.

In 2019, Trump’s Treasury secretary rejected Neal’s request for Trump’s tax returns, arguing it was more of a political ploy than a congressional effort to explore the need for new legislation.

After Trump was defeated in 2020, Neal submitted a new request, and it was approved by the new Biden administration.

Trump then went to court seeking to the block the release.

U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, dismissed his lawsuit in December, and the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington affirmed that decision in August by a 3-0 vote.

McFadden cautioned that his ruling did not authorize the public release of Trump’s taxes.

“Public disclosure of another’s tax returns is a grave offense, and prior committee chairmen have wisely resisted using” the law “to publicize individuals’ returns,” he wrote.",Economy
latimes,Economy,9308,latimes,"President Biden and Rep. Katie Porter sought to focus voters’ attention on Democrats’ work to lower the cost of prescription drugs during an event in Orange County on Friday afternoon. With inflation likely to be Democrats’ biggest liability in next month’s midterm elections, Biden and Porter (D-Irvine) eagerly emphasized what their party had already done to try to reduce consumer costs.

The Inflation Reduction Act, a domestic spending package Biden signed into law in August, expands access to healthcare under the Affordable Care Act, allows Medicare to negotiate with drug companies, lowers the cost of insulin and imposes a $2,000 annual cap on seniors’ out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.

But those actions won’t take effect until 2026, so are unlikely to ease the immediate economic pain for Americans struggling with higher costs, especially of gas and food. Biden made only passing mention of the consumer price index report released Thursday showing inflation abating only slightly at 8.2%.

“We’ve made a lot of progress, but folks are still struggling,” Biden said, acknowledging the economic pain during an event at Irvine Valley College. He called the Inflation Reduction Act “a gigantic change” and “one of the most important bills ever when it comes to helping families pay their bills at the end of the month.”

Biden criticized Republicans for voting against the law and warned that the GOP would roll back its benefits if they win enough seats on Nov. 8.

“If Republicans take control, prices are going to go up,” he said.

Attendees were given a White House-produced flier that mimicked the “12-Point Plan to Rescue America” released earlier this year by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.). Biden referenced Scott’s plan as proof that Republicans want to cut Medicare and Social Security benefits.

Biden also signed a largely symbolic executive order Friday tasking the federal government with finding new ways to lower drug costs within the next 90 days.

Porter, the first Democrat ever to represent her district, has been an effective fundraiser as she seeks a third term, having boosted her national profile with several performances in committee hearings that went viral, including some in which she blasts pharmaceutical executives for price gouging.

“Big Pharma fights tooth and nail to [avoid] negotiating fair prices because it wants to line its pockets with our taxpayer dollars. Congressional Democrats and President Biden said enough is enough,” Porter told the crowd of 200 people in a small outdoor courtyard, adding that allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices will help working families. “We stood up to the special interests, and we put people first.”

Biden praised Porter for her toughness and credited her with helping pass the Inflation Reduction Act.

“You are a fighter, you’re decent, you’re honorable and everybody respects you,” he said. “Because you get a lot done.”

The president began his remarks by addressing the concerns of hundreds of Iranian Americans who had gathered with signs on the outskirts of the campus, stating that the U.S. “stands with the brave people” fighting for more rights in Iran.

“Iran has to end the violence against its own citizens simply exercising [their] fundamental rights,” he said.

Biden has been eager to emphasize all that he and Democrats have accomplished legislatively since he took office less than two years ago: a massive pandemic relief package; bipartisan laws to overhaul infrastructure, boost American microchip manufacturing and improve healthcare for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals on the battlefield; and the Inflation Reduction Act.

He has been less vocal about some of the more charged issues affecting the midterm campaign, including abortion rights. And his four-day Western trip this week has shown that many of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents believe they may be better served by avoiding the president.

Biden’s campaign swing did not include stops in Arizona or Nevada, where Democratic incumbents face harder races that are likely to determine which party controls the Senate next year.

He started his trip with a stop in Colorado on Wednesday, appearing with Sen. Michael Bennet, a Democrat facing a serious challenge as he seeks a third full term in a state that has turned more blue over the last decade. That appearance, where Biden designated his first new national monument high in the Rocky Mountains, excluded talk of other issues, addressing only the preservation of Camp Hale, a World War II-era training camp.

On Thursday, Biden appeared twice with Los Angeles mayoral candidate Karen Bass. The president spoke at an event highlighting how funds from last year’s infrastructure overhaul aided the construction of the city’s new westside Metro Line expansion, then proceeded to a photo op at a Westwood taco shop.

Thursday evening’s fundraiser at the Brentwood home of television producer Marcy Carsey, which raised $5 million for Democratic House candidates, was the centerpiece of Biden’s swing through the West Coast.

After the event with Porter, Biden flew to Portland, Ore., on Friday evening for two events aimed at boosting the Democratic candidate in that state’s surprisingly competitive three-way race for governor.",Economy
latimes,Economy,9301,latimes,"Republican Jack Guerrero in the November election faces the difficult task for trying to unseat the Democratic state Treasurer Fiona Ma, who won a lopsided victory in the June primary and remains popular among California voters despite a string of scandals.

The treasurer is the state’s top banker and is responsible for managing its finances and investments, and serves on powerful boards and committees that oversee the state employee pension systems and allocate state bond financing for projects for affordable housing, education, infrastructure and the environment.

Throughout their campaigns, the two candidates have continued to lay down opposing visions of how to approach the job of California’s top banker. Ma is hoping to build on programs she championed during her first four years and Guerrero, a councilman from Cudahy who has held the position since 2013, looks to shake up the office and Sacramento politics, which he said is responsible for the “mismanagement” of taxpayer dollars.

“The time has come for an independent watchdog who is free from the single-party apparatus in Sacramento, to bring checks and balances to the government, and to serve honorably and tell the truth to taxpayers of our dire financial condition,” said Guerrero in February while announcing his candidacy.

Although Guerrero’s large, reformist promises were enough to win him 1.4 million votes in the June primary, he was still handedly outmatched by Ma, who won a clear majority 3.8 million votes — 57% of the ballots cast.

Ma is also outpacing Guerrero in fundraising. Guerrero has gathered $20,000 while Ma has raised more than $4 million.

Unseating an elected incumbent state treasurer is rare. Voters haven’t selected a challenger since 1958.

Guerrero is also attempting to become the first Republican treasurer since Matt Fong was elected to the office in 1995, a steep climb in a state in which nearly 47% of registered voters are Democrats, 24% are Republican and close to 23% are “no party preference.” No Republican has been elected to a statewide office since 2006.

He has attempted to make up ground by criticizing the way the state is handling its debt, credit rating and the large amounts of unfunded debt of CalSTRS and CalPERS, which manage pensions for California public school educators and other public employees. He has said the state is overspending on “pet projects” and calls for less taxes and less government spending.

Guerrero said that, if elected, he plans to show up on the Senate and Assembly floors to warn lawmakers about spending bills that would increase state debt.

“I’m going to be doing that until the legislators are sick and tired of seeing my face,” he said.

Throughout the campaign, Ma has emphasized her history of working with lawmakers to pass legislation that boost funding to address some of the state’s largest issues, such as the housing crisis.

Ma had championed Assembly Bill 140, passed in 2021, which gives the treasurer’s office a say in the direction of the California Dream For All program, which aims to make home ownership, especially for first-time homebuyers, more affordable. The bill has been heralded as a valuable tool to help close the racial wealth gap.

She also is focused on streamlining the process for distributing funding for affordable housing projects, which she said could move more efficiently and with more transparency for those applying for bonds and tax credits.

“If we can make that happen, that would be like the crown jewel for housing,” she said.

Other initiatives she supported include the Cal KIDS program, which gives every child born in California on or after July 1 up to $100 automatically, and up to $1,500 automatically to every eligible low-income student to help pay for and encourage saving for college; and CalSavers, which required all businesses and nonprofits with five or more employees in the state to either offer their adult workers a “qualified” retirement plan or sign up for state-run retirement savings programs.

Ma’s tenure has also seen some controversy. She was criticized for charging taxpayers more than $32,000 in lodging and meal expenses to travel regularly from her home in San Francisco to Sacramento, a practice that other statewide officers do not engage in, a Sacramento Bee investigation found. She has also been sued by a former employee for sexual harassment and wrongful termination.

Ma has rejected accusations of misconduct and called ongoing litigation “frivolous” and the result of a “disgruntled employee” who was terminated for performance issues. She said she now commutes to and from her home in San Francisco each day.

A former San Francisco Board supervisor and state assemblymember, Ma has remained popular among voters despite several scandals.

Guerrero, who, like Ma is a certified accountant, ran for local office after his city of Cudahy was rocked with scandals. As mayor aiming to move his hometown city past its legacy of corruption, he called on the state controller to audit the city’s finances and administrative controls.

Guerrero said he intends to help low-income Californians through training programs for joining the workforce, and for the government to offer incentives to encourage investment in the private sector to address areas of need.

“For all quality of life, I think the private sector is the best hope that we have,” he said.",Economy
latimes,Economy,9249,latimes,"The Biden administration plans to exclude Cuba from the upcoming Summit of the Americas, a major global meeting to be held in Los Angeles in June that typically welcomes all governments in the Western Hemisphere, a senior U.S. official told The Times.

The summit, which is held every three or four years, is being convened in the United States for the first time since its 1994 inaugural session in Miami. Los Angeles was chosen as the venue earlier this year.

The administration’s refusal to invite Cuba is likely to anger several other Latin American countries as President Biden and the State Department attempt to repair damaged relations in the region.

“We expect the democratic nations of our hemisphere to gather for a conversation,” Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, said in an interview, referring to the summit.

Cuba, he said, is decidedly not part of that group, especially after demonstrations in July in which Cubans demanded political and economic freedoms. Many people were arrested and at least one died. In addition, Washington has opposed Russian influence in communist-ruled Cuba, its lack of free speech and its human rights record.

Numerous advocates who support improved relations with Cuba — including some in Congress — had hoped the Biden administration would reopen diplomatic, political and trade ties with the island that were frozen under President Trump. Trump reversed a historic opening initiated by President Obama, who sought to end a half-century of Cold War hostilities.

However, President Biden has done little to roll back Trump’s rebukes of Cuba, which included adding the country to a U.S. government list of state sponsors of terrorism. And the administration is only slowly reestablishing U.S. consular services in Havana that would help Cubans obtain visas for legal travel.

In addition, a U.S. policy on remittances, money that people, including Cuban Americans, can send to island residents, remains “under review,” strangling a lifeline for many. Flights by American carriers, trips by U.S. tourists and cultural exchanges also remain problematic without clearer guidelines from the administration.

Meanwhile, a tough economic embargo on the island that dates to the Eisenhower administration remains in place.

The hard line on Cuba appears to have carried over to the Summit of the Americas.

For many summits after the inaugural session, all held in Latin America or the Caribbean, Cuba has not been invited or has declined an invitation.

More recently, however, its government began to participate, invited despite it engaging in practices that other members of the region’s diplomatic bodies, such as the Organization of American States, have harshly condemned.

The U.S. decision, which has not been formally announced and will ultimately be made by Biden, is already attracting criticism in the region.

In addition to Cuba voicing opposition to the move, officials in Mexico, a key U.S. ally, indicated they were not pleased. In a phone call on April 29, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged Biden to invite to the summit all the countries of the Western Hemisphere, “without excluding anyone.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard held closed-door meetings with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Tuesday in Washington. Ebrard said later at a news conference at the Mexican Embassy that he asked Blinken to reconsider denying invitations to Cuba, as well as to Nicaragua and Venezuela, which are also expected to be excluded. Ebrard said he came away without a definitive answer.

On April 11, 2015, on the sidelines of a Summit of the Americas in Panama, Obama met and shook hands with then-President Raul Castro of Cuba, the first contact between leaders of the two countries in decades. Obama said at the time that he believed the two countries could disagree in “the spirit of respect and civility” and that the time was coming “to turn the page.”

Within months, the two revived diplomatic ties between their countries, reopened various economic and trade arrangements, and Obama made a historic trip to Havana.

Trump reversed those actions, ending travel and freezing remittances and reversing diplomatic overtures. And Biden has not chosen to reinstate Obama’s diplomatic approach.

For the Summit of the Americas, it is also unlikely that the U.S. will invite Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega has conducted what the U.S. and many other nations and democracy groups call a sham election that gave him yet another term in office.

And Venezuela is always the skunk at the picnic, with President Nicolas Maduro shunned at most international gatherings. The question is whether Biden will invite Juan Guaidó, a Venezuelan opposition leader whom the U.S. government has recognized as the rightful leader of the country despite little domestic support.

Yet some questionable democracies will be invited because of overriding ties they have with the United States, Nichols and other officials said.

El Salvador, for example, has such long-standing ties with the U.S., dating to its civil war in the 1980s — in which the Reagan administration backed the Salvadoran government and numerous U.S. church and civil rights groups supported the opposition — that the country should not be excluded, Nichols said.

“We obviously have deep and long-standing ties with El Salvador and their millions of Salvadorans in the United States,” Nichols said, noting that ties were particularly strong to Southern California.

“We have very substantial differences with President [Nayib] Bukele on a number of issues, particularly related to democracy, the separation of powers and transparency, [yet] I believe that it will be important for El Salvador to participate,” Nichols said, referring to recent actions by Bukele to erode judicial independence and silence dissent and journalists critical of his administration.

The summit will be a forum to discuss immigration, trade, climate change and ways to reinforce democracy, among other topics. Nichols said it was likely the region’s leaders will produce a “Los Angeles declaration” on promoting “safe, humane orderly migration” and ensuring that migrants “can be protected where they are, and there are opportunities for them to remain in place.”",Economy
latimes,Economy,9329,latimes,"President Biden issued a stark warning Wednesday about threats to American democracy, using a prime-time speech to urge voters to reject “ultra MAGA” Republicans who undermine faith in the voting process.

The president, who has sought to paint Republicans as an extremist party loyal to former President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” or “MAGA” movement, blamed his predecessor for a continued assault on democracy that Biden said had given rise to political violence.

“American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president of the United States refuses to accept the results of the 2020 election,” Biden said. “Make no mistake: Democracy is on the ballot for all of us.”

In the speech, which was hosted by the Democratic National Committee, Biden connected the recent violent attack on Paul Pelosi, the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol.

The president noted that the assailant asked Paul Pelosi, “Where’s Nancy?”

“Those are the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States Capitol on Jan. 6,” Biden said.

Federal officials said the alleged attacker, David DePape, broke into the couple’s San Francisco home with the intention of taking Speaker Pelosi hostage and breaking her kneecaps.

In his speech, Biden repeated warnings he has issued in recent months, arguing that a GOP victory on Nov. 8 would endanger American democracy.

“As I stand here today, there are candidates running for every level of office in America ... who won’t commit to accepting the results of the election they’re in,” he said.

“That is the path to chaos in America. It’s unprecedented. It’s unlawful,” he added.

Biden emphasized that the threat to democracy — and the threat of political violence — is coming from a minority of Americans. But “they’re loud and they are determined,” he said.

At least 199 GOP candidates for statewide or federal offices in next week’s elections have explicitly embraced the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen or have worked to overturn its results, according to an analysis by FiveThirtyEight.

Biden and his party have spent much of the last year sounding the alarm about the threat those candidates pose to democracy. But even as Democrats railed against the candidates, some liberal groups helped to elevate them in Republican primaries, hoping they would be easier to beat in the general election.

Despite those efforts, Republicans are favored to win control of the House on Tuesday, snarling Democratic plans for the next two years.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) characterized Biden’s speech as an attempt to distract voters from the president’s record ahead of Tuesday’s election.

“President Biden is trying to divide and deflect at a time when America needs to unite,” McCarthy tweeted, “because he can’t talk about his policies that have driven up the cost of living. The American people aren’t buying it.”

Biden delivered Wednesday’s remarks at the Columbus Club at Union Station in Washington, near the site of the attack on the U.S. Capitol nearly two years ago. His choice of venue was intended to remind viewers of the threat of political violence, White House official Anita Dunn told a panel hosted by Axios earlier Wednesday.

“I wish I could say the assault on our democracy ended that day,” Biden said of the Jan. 6 attacks. “But I cannot.”

During a campaign fundraiser for Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist on Tuesday, Biden assailed some Republicans for not condemning the assault on Paul Pelosi and for spreading conspiracy theories about it online.

“Look at the response of Republicans, making jokes about it,” Biden told the crowd. “These guys are extremely extreme.”

On Monday, Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake joked at a campaign event about the attack. Donald Trump Jr. has posted several social media comments mocking it.

Former President Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are among GOP leaders who have condemned the attack, though Trump has also advanced the false narrative that the attack was not a break-in.

As Biden noted in his speech Wednesday, polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans believe democracy is at risk.

Inflation and the economy, however, have ranked as more pressing issues for voters.

A majority of voters agree democracy is in danger, but Americans are divided over how to address the threat and whether it remains a priority in this election cycle, according to a New York Times-Siena College poll released last month.

About 71% of registered voters in the survey said that democracy was under threat, but only 7% said that was the most important issue facing the country.

The president implored voters to remember that there are bigger concerns than high gas prices and inflation on the ballot in Tuesday’s election.

“I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance,” he said. “We must vote knowing what’s at stake and not just [on] the policy of the moment.”",Economy
latimes,Economy,9318,latimes,"President Biden, unwelcome in many battleground states over the final two weeks of the midterm election, spoke from the White House on Thursday about his latest attempt to ease the economic burdens many Americans are facing.

With voters’ concerns about inflation and gas prices boosting Republicans as early voting gets underway in many states, Biden announced that his administration is cracking down on surprise fees that drive up what people pay to their banks and for everything from food deliveries to hotels and airline tickets.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Biden said, would immediately prohibit banks from imposing surprise fees on some overdrafts and deposits.

“These steps will immediately start saving Americans collectively billions of dollars on unfair fees,” Biden said, explaining that the White House Competition Council, which has been studying the issue of surprise fees for months, is working to develop additional rules for credit card companies and other industries that hide fees from consumers.

The fees, he said, are “taking real money out of the pockets of American families” and “benefit big corporations, not consumers, not working families. That changes now.”

Biden, who will travel to upstate New York on Thursday and host a fundraiser in Philadelphia on Friday, has largely avoided campaigning with Democratic candidates in the House and Senate races that will decide control of Congress. During a four-day West Coast trip earlier this month, he skipped Arizona and Nevada, where Democratic incumbents are fighting to hold on. Next week, he’ll hold a rally in Florida, a state where few Democratic officials believe their party has a real shot at winning either the Senate or gubernatorial race. With election day fast approaching, he will be off the trail for a second straight weekend, spending time at home in Delaware.

It’s not unusual for the incumbent president to be a drag on his party in his first midterm election, and Biden’s approval rating continues to sit in the low 40s due to broad frustrations with his inability to curb inflation. During his event about surprise fees, Biden addressed the issue, asserting that the economic situation is improving.

“By the way, the price of gasoline continues to fall,” he said, noting that gas prices have fallen for three weeks in a row. “The most common price right now in America is $3.49 a gallon.”

Biden’s latest attempt to address the economic anxiety that may be tipping the election toward Republicans came just hours after what may end up being a decisive moment in a Senate race that many expect to determine which party controls the chamber next year.

In Tuesday night’s debate between candidates for the open Pennsylvania Senate seat, Democrat John Fetterman struggled to clearly articulate his responses due to aphasia resulting from a severe stroke he suffered in May. If the hour-long debate deepens voters’ concerns about Fetterman’s ability to serve, Republican Mehmet Oz could eke out a win in a race where he was trailing by double digits just a few months ago.

Although scattershot polling and high early turnout make it hard to predict how the election will end up, both parties seem to view the battle in Pennsylvania as the tipping point race that will determine who controls the Senate. Interestingly, Pennsylvania is also the one swing state where Biden, who has Scranton roots, has campaigned on the ground.

Under some criticism for focusing his midterm appeals mostly on Democrats’ legislative accomplishments over the last two years, Biden looked to convey more of an understanding of the hardships many are facing. As he wrapped up his remarks, he offered an assessment of why people are fed up.

“One of the things that I think frustrates American people is they know the world’s in a bit of disarray,” he said. “They know that [Russian President Vladimir] Putin’s war has imposed an awful lot of strains on Europe and the rest of the world,” he went on, noting the impact on energy prices and food. “And they want to know, what are we doing?”

His administration’s actions on surprise fees, he said, would save families hundreds of dollars a year. And he vowed to continue pushing oil companies to pass on their savings to consumers now that the price of oil has dropped.

“I’m optimistic,” he said. “It’s gonna take some time. And I appreciate the frustration of the American people.”",Economy
latimes,Economy,9383,latimes,"The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a last-minute plea from the tobacco industry and cleared the way for California to enforce a statewide ban on the sale of most flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes.

The court’s action has the effect of upholding a measure passed by the Legislature in 2020, which in turn was approved by 63% of voters in November. It is due to take effect next week.

The outcome is a victory for anti-tobacco advocates who called for cracking down on e-cigarettes and eliminating youth-friendly flavors such as bubble gum, cotton candy and cherry that could lure kids to use tobacco.

California joins Massachusetts and New York in prohibiting the sale of flavored tobacco.

The tobacco industry spent heavily on lobbying and ad campaigns to defeat the California legislation and the subsequent ballot measure.

When that failed, the industry sued to stop or delay the measure. The industry’s lawyers argued the state ban conflicted with a law adopted by Congress in 2009 authorizing federal regulation of tobacco products.

The tobacco companies lost before U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer in Los Angeles and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on the grounds that the law preserved the authority of states and localities to prohibit the sale of tobacco products.

Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento have already adopted local bans on flavored tobacco.

Washington attorney Noel Francisco, who served as U.S. solicitor general under then-President Trump, filed an emergency appeal with Justice Elena Kagan on Nov. 29, asking her and the high court to stop California’s statewide ban from taking effect.

“An injunction will preserve the decades-old status quo, thereby allowing this court time to decide the merits without letting loose the grave irreparable harm that California’s law will inflict,” he wrote in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco vs. Bonta. Without such an order, he said, the tobacco companies “will be shut out of one of the nation’s largest markets for flavored tobacco products.”

He said if enforcement were put on hold, the court could then agree to hear the case in the spring and decide whether the federal law conflicted with the California measure.

Kagan, who oversees appeals from the 9th Circuit, asked for a response from California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta, which was filed on Tuesday.

Bonta noted that no judge has agreed with the tobacco industry’s claims, and said it is time for “allowing the will of the voters to take effect, as opposed to preserving a status quo that imperils the health of more young people in California with each passing day.”

Kagan referred the RJR appeal to the full court, which issued a brief order denying it without comment and with no dissents.

“The court was absolutely right to deny R.J. Reynolds’ aggressive and unreasonable effort to stall California’s new law,” said Joelle Lester, director of tobacco control at the Public Health Law Center in St. Paul, Minn. “This issue has been extensively litigated and federal circuit courts have uniformly uphold the local authority to protect health in this way.”",Economy
latimes,Economy,9271,latimes,"The recent spike in gasoline prices took the greatest financial toll on Black and Latino Californians, though more than half of all adults in the state reported suffering at least moderate economic hardship, according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California.

Californians living in the Inland Empire and Central Valley, where distant commutes or long drives for work and daily chores are commonplace, also felt a far greater pinch due to steep prices at the pump compared with those living in the state’s densely populated urban landscapes, especially the San Francisco Bay Area.

State Republicans have used high gas prices, which have been on the decline since peaking in the late spring and early summer, to attack Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Legislature’s Democratic leadership for refusing to temporarily suspend the state’s highest-in-the-nation gas tax.

But neither Newsom nor Democratic lawmakers appear to have suffered politically due to the high gas prices or other economic turbulence around the nation, the poll showed.

The survey found that nearly 60% of adults in the state approved of the way Newsom has handled the issue of jobs and the economy, while just under 40% disapproved.

The California Legislature, where Democrats hold supermajorities in both the Senate and Assembly, received similar marks: 55% of adults approved of their actions while 42% disapproved.

Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive, called those approval numbers “incredible” given that the poll also showed that 70% of adults in the state felt that bad times were ahead for the California economy in the next 12 months. Baldassare said the brunt of voter anger over the rise in inflation and other economic concerns has been more focused on President Biden and Congress.

“On inflation, people are not only feeling it but they’re upset,” Baldassare said. “People are feeling that things are just out of control ... and expect government to have a handle on that so that they don’t have to worry about it.”

Perhaps helping Newsom and other Democrat leaders at the Capitol was a spending plan the governor signed in June that will provide payments to 17.5 million California taxpayers to lessen the impact of high fuel prices and the cost of living.

The plan provides payments on a sliding scale based on income. The lowest income bracket is eligible for $350 per tax filer and another $350 for those who claim at least one dependent. Respective payments drop to $250 for the middle-income level and $200 for the highest.

Gas prices have been one of the major drivers of rising inflation nationwide, and the effect has been especially acute in California, which is topped only by Texas when it comes to gasoline consumption.

One in four Latino adults in California said high gas prices caused severe financial hardship, and 49% reported moderate hardship, the poll found. Among Black adults, 23% reported severe financial hardship and 35% moderate. Severe hardship also was felt among 15% of white and 12% of Asian American adults. Moderate hardship was reported by 36% of white and 20% of Asian American adults, according to the poll.

Despite calls by mostly Republican leaders to combat high gasoline prices by expanding oil production, two-thirds of Californians remain opposed to more offshore oil drilling, the poll found.",Economy
latimes,Economy,9312,latimes,"He ignored long odds and waged an uphill bid to dislodge fellow Democrat Dianne Feinstein from the U.S. Senate.

He barely warmed his seat on the Los Angeles City Council before throwing himself into the race for mayor.

Both efforts proved unavailing. But until De León was caught yukking it up on a recording filled with racist, homophobic, cruel and cutting remarks, neither setback seemed to have done him any great harm.

Few — much less De León — viewed the council as the zenith of his public career. There was talk of another statewide run, perhaps for lieutenant governor, a job that has been a stepping stone for two of California’s recent governors, including Gavin Newsom.

Now, shorn of power at City Hall and facing protesters camped out in his Eagle Rock neighborhood, the question is whether De León’s once-bright political future has gone the way of the Dodgers’ dashed World Series dreams.

On Wednesday, the 55-year-old councilmember broke a lengthy silence to reiterate his intention to stay in office. “No, I will not resign, because there is a lot of work ahead,” De León said in a Noticiero Univision interview.

That stubbornness doesn’t bode well for his future.

By brazening it out and refusing to quit, De León may be hoping not just to hang on to his council seat for another two years but preserve his chances for bigger and brighter things beyond City Hall.

“I don’t think anything is impossible in politics,” said Bill Carrick, a longtime Democratic strategist and Feinstein advisor. “But it would be very, very difficult.”

There are plenty of politicians who’ve weathered knee-buckling scandals and, after righting themselves, gone on to prosper. Bill Clinton. John McCain. And, not least, Donald Trump.

As San Francisco mayor, Newsom was reelected after a particularly sordid episode involving an extramarital affair with the wife of a friend and longtime aide. Newsom — months away from seeking a second term — acknowledged his wrongdoing, apologized and said he would seek counseling for alcohol abuse.

“Never underestimate the public’s ability to forgive if you ask for that forgiveness and they believe you’re sincere about it,” said Roger Salazar, a Democratic consultant who served as spokesman for De León’s Senate campaign.

Of course, not all political scandals are the same. Some involve personal lapses, which may be salved with a show of humility and contrition. Others stem from a misuse of public assets, a breach of trust or an act of hypocrisy — though, really, is it all that shocking for a politician to say one thing and do another?

The scandal darkening Los Angeles City Hall is of a different order.

The bigotry and casual venom surreptitiously captured on tape, which led to the resignations of council President Nury Martinez and labor leader Ron Herrera and which shredded the reputations of De León and fellow Councilmember Gil Cedillo, was uglier and more damaging than some mere personal transgression.

“This was an attack on a whole community,” Carrick said.

Like a poisoned smorgasbord, there was something on the recording to turn every stomach. There was also plenty to offend members of several key Democratic constituencies, among them Latinos, women, Jews and, especially, Black voters.

The what-about chorus will bring up former President Trump, who withstood countless controversies to win the White House and has, on various occasion, emitted something to offend to virtually every man, woman and child on Earth.

“We’re Democrats. We’re supposed to be better than that,” said a party strategist in Sacramento, who wished not to be identified so her political clients wouldn’t be dragged into the City Hall muck. “If you’re going to call out people on a regular basis, you can’t accept that kind of racist conversation and behavior from one of our own.”

Several of the state’s leading political practitioners offered De León some free, unsolicited advice: Quit the council, now. Apologize.

“People believe in redemption,” said a former state legislative leader who worked closely with De León in Sacramento and asked not to be named to preserve their personal relationship. “But if you’re trying to ride it out... it’s hard to get redemption when there’s no meaningful effort or apology.”

On Wednesday, De León did say he was sorry.

“I apologize to all my people, to my entire community, for the damage caused by the painful words that were carried out that day last year,” De León said in the interview with Noticiero Univision anchor León Krauze.

Separately, De León sent a letter to council President Paul Krekorian apologizing to the city’s residents.

“I come to you with a shame deeper than I have ever known and from a place of deep humility,” De León wrote, adding he intended to “spend every waking moment working to heal the pain and damage this moment has caused and apply the lessons I’ve learned.”

But that was as far as he went, which fell short of what many prescribed.

Once he quit and apologized, political operatives agreed, De León should disappear for a while. Do good work for some of those in the communities he offended. Keep out of the public eye, and forget about mounting a political comeback anytime soon.

“Don’t resign from the council one day and then three days later announce you’re running for something else,” said Democratic consultant Garry South.

Right now De León’s political designs should be the least of his considerations.

When he launched his Senate bid in 2017, De León attacked Feinstein for suggesting early in Trump’s term that maybe the petulant and mean-spirited president would grow and become a better man.

“We can’t cross our fingers and hope that Trump can learn and change,” De León said, chiding Feinstein for harboring false hopes.

He was right. Trump never did learn and change.

Maybe De León can do better.",Economy
latimes,Economy,9387,latimes,"More than a decade ago, scholars began pointing to a troubling global trend: a “democratic recession.” Dozens of countries were drifting away from democracy toward authoritarianism.

The list of backsliders has spanned the globe from India and South Africa to Hungary, Poland, Mexico — even, in recent years, the United States.

Freedom House, a nonprofit organization that rates countries on electoral practices, civil liberties and other measures, has reported 16 consecutive years of the world becoming less democratic.

Meanwhile, China’s authoritarian regime has been touting its one-party system as more efficient and dynamic than the tired old democracies.

But look again. The autocrats are having a bad year.

In China, Xi Jinping’s draconian policy of “zero COVID” has slowed economic growth and spurred angry protests.

Russia’s Vladimir Putin has launched a disastrous war against Ukraine, prompting almost a million young Russians to flee their country to avoid conscription.

In Iran, protests by young women against laws requiring headscarves have mushroomed into a broader rebellion demanding an end to the authoritarian Islamic regime.

Meanwhile, at least some of the world’s democracies appear to have found a second wind. Extreme right-wing parties have lost in France and Germany, although they won in Italy and Sweden. Brazil’s autocratic President Jair Bolsonaro lost his job in a well-conducted national election; he challenged the result in court and lost again. And U.S. voters delivered an unexpectedly clear message in last month’s midterm elections, rejecting candidates who embraced the election denialism of former President Trump.

So is the democratic recession ending?

Unfortunately, no. The scholar who originated the phrase, Larry Diamond of Stanford, says it’s too early to break out the champagne.

“I don’t see the current protests in Iran, China or Russia leading to a democratic breakthrough,” he told me. “I think it is very much a jump ball globally right now — and I see a lot of warning signs that people aren’t paying attention to.”

“Democracy has not come roaring back,” he said. “I think we’re going to turn the corner at some point, but it hasn’t happened yet.”

It’s useful to distinguish between two issues here. One is the crisis of the authoritarian regimes; the other is the health of the world’s democracies.

In China, Russia and Iran, Diamond said, we’re seeing a process of “authoritarian regime decay.”

“The regimes have been performing badly in meeting people’s expectations,” he said. “As a result, each is facing a legitimacy crisis — a sharp decline in the belief that the regime has the right to govern.”

That doesn’t mean those governments are likely to fall: All have decades of experience at repressing dissidents, now reinforced by increasingly sophisticated surveillance technology.

In recent weeks, all three regimes have attempted to placate unhappy citizens. China has ended “zero COVID.” Putin has told Russians there will be no more military call-ups soon. And a top Iranian official said the country’s widely hated morality police was being disbanded, although it wasn’t clear whether the announcement had any real effect.

But none of them look like attractive models for others to follow.

Meanwhile, democracy is still struggling.

“Mexico and India are in the grip of authoritarian demagogues,” Diamond wrote. “Nigeria faces the prospect of partial state collapse. South Africa, on which the hopes of democracy in Africa so heavily depend, is not doing well.”

That’s why, to scholars of democracy, some of the best news of the year came from our own midterm election.

“That was a test of whether antidemocratic candidates — antidemocratic with a small D; I’m not being partisan — would be put in a position to run future elections,” Abramowitz said.

“They lost pretty decisively, and that’s significant,” he added. “It suggested that civil society in the United States has revitalized itself.”

In an Associated Press survey, 44% of U.S. voters polled named the future of democracy as one of their top concerns on election day, outranked only by inflation and the economy.

A postelection survey by Bright Line Watch, a nonpartisan research group, found a similar number who said that “protecting democracy” would be the most important issue when they choose a presidential candidate in 2024.

“We’re not out of the woods yet by any means,” Abramowitz said. “But I’m a little more hopeful than a year ago.”

So we can take some satisfaction in the misfortunes of the world’s worst dictators. And we can take heart at the evidence, however tentative, that democracy can still be a self-correcting system.

But these battles are a long way from over. Making democracy work is a struggle that remains to be won.",Economy
latimes,Election,9314,latimes,"With election day two weeks away, Republican prospects of taking control of the House of Representatives, already strong, appear to have solidified. Barring the unexpected, President Biden’s next two years will be shaped by challenges from a House led by some of his most zealous opponents.

That isn’t unusual; every president for the last four decades has contended with divided government. Sometimes, that has arguably been a good thing — a constructive check on executive power.

The House won’t merely be held by Republicans. It will be led by Republicans loyal to former President Trump, many of whom refuse to accept Biden’s legitimacy as president.

Most members of the new majority will have been elected with Trump’s endorsement. There will be almost no Trump critics in the House GOP — none who dare voice their qualms, at least. The caucus has been purged.

Of the 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, eight retired or lost primary elections. Only two are still on the ballot.

Of the likely members of the next majority, well more than half have questioned or denied the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. January’s incoming members will, not incidentally, be in the House when it considers the results of the presidential election of 2024.

Meanwhile, the ranks of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus are swelling. The group has been recruiting members among this year’s candidates and is on track to boast at least 46 next year, an all-time high.

The likely next House speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield), is a Trump loyalist too. As Republican floor leader during the Trump administration, McCarthy worked to forge a relationship with the volatile president, who rewarded him with the slightly demeaning nickname “My Kevin.” McCarthy broke with Trump oh-so-briefly over the Jan. 6 riot but flew to Mar-a-Lago three weeks later to seek forgiveness.

McCarthy has made clear that other Trump acolytes will gain under his speakership. He has promised Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, one of the founders of the Freedom Caucus, the chairmanship of the powerful Judiciary Committee. He has promised Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who once suggested that California’s wildfires were caused by Jewish-funded space lasers, a seat on the Oversight Committee, which is likely to launch an investigation of Hunter Biden, the president’s wayward son.

Jordan and the Freedom Caucus were once considered GOP gadflies, in-House critics who challenged the less disruptive conservatism of Speakers John Boehner and Paul D. Ryan. Greene was considered an outlier whose ability to grab headlines was a problem, not an asset.

No longer. Both are now core members of a GOP conference whose mission is to fight the Biden administration to a standstill.

Their agenda begins with deep spending cuts in domestic programs, which they argue are needed to shrink the federal budget deficit and quell inflation.

Some members have already declared their willingness to shut down the federal government to get their way.

“Shut it down if necessary,” Rep. Bob Good of Virginia said last week. “Gridlock is a good thing compared to the alternative.”

Even worse, several have said they plan to block an increase in the federal debt ceiling — a move that would raise the specter of the government defaulting on its debts and risk a global financial crash.

McCarthy said he too would be willing to block a debt limit increase as a tactic to force spending cuts.

“OK, we’ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior,” he told the newsletter Punchbowl News.

Government shutdowns and debt-ceiling hostage dramas tend to backfire on the party that launches them. Most voters don’t enjoy watching the economy being held hostage by politicians.

McCarthy presumably knows that — but he also knows his majority includes many who would relish a showdown, either on principle or to pander to right-wing voters.

In another sign that Republican radicals are in the ascendance, McCarthy said he wants to impose limits on future U.S. aid to Ukraine, a hobbyhorse of Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

“Ukraine is important, but … it can’t be a blank check,” McCarthy said.

It adds up to a recipe for a series of collisions — not only with the Biden White House but with the Senate. No matter how the election turns out, the Senate is almost certain to be narrowly divided between the parties — and because of its 60-vote filibuster rule, any major legislation will need support from at least a few senators on both sides.

In an earlier generation, Americans often viewed divided government as a sensible way to check the power of the president and even an opportunity for bipartisan deal-making.

Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin sought to evoke that brand of nostalgia this month, arguing that GOP control of Congress could be “a calming influence.”

But there’s not much prospect of serenity from a House of Representatives led by McCarthy and his Trumpified party.

Pro-Trump voters who want to stop the Biden administration cold, no matter the cost, may enjoy the battle. But moderates and independents who vote for divided government, expecting anything better than chaos, are indulging in wishful thinking.",Election
latimes,Election,9288,latimes,"The Supreme Court opened its new term on Monday by hearing a property rights appeal that calls for limiting the government’s power to protect millions of acres of wetlands from development.

At issue is whether the Clean Water Act forbids polluting wetlands and marshes that are near — but not strictly part of — waterways.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in her first day on the bench led the way in questioning why the court should move to limit the protection for wetlands.

She said Congress in 1977 determined that wetlands “adjacent” to rivers and bays should be protected. Why should the law be narrowed, she asked, “when the objective of the statute is to ensure the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters? Are you saying that neighboring wetlands can’t impact the quality of navigable waters?”

Justices Elena Kagan and Brett M. Kavanaugh said they agreed with that view. Kavanaugh said that seven administrations — Republican and Democratic — had taken the view that wetlands were protected if they were near a waterway.

Damien Schiff, an attorney for Pacific Legal Foundation, agreed that some wetlands can be protected, but he argued property owners should not be blocked from developing their land simply because it has a marshy area.

His argument won favor with several of the court’s conservatives who questioned how property owners of land near a waterway or a wetland would know if they were subject to federal regulation.

Jackson noted that the prior owners of the Idaho land were told it included protected wetlands.

“You keep talking about fair notice and property owners, about not being able to tell or know about this issue,” she told Schiff. But with respect to the Idaho couple, “there seems to have been a prior determination that the land was a wetland before they bought it, and whether or not they know, they could have known, I presume.”

For two hours, justices went back and forth in a lively debate among themselves and with the attorneys over how to define when property owners need a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency before they develop their land. It was unclear how the majority will rule.

Congress passed the Clean Water Act 50 years ago, but there has been a continuing dispute over whether federal authority extends to marshy areas or seasonal streams that are near a river, lake or bay.

In 2006, the high court was split on the issue. Four conservatives led by the late Justice Antonin Scalia said the EPA regulation was limited to permanent or flowing bodies of waters, not wetlands or seasonal streams. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy agreed on some limits, but not when there was “significant nexus” between a wetland and a flowing waterway.

That standard was denounced by builders, developers and farmers, who complained it led to overreach by federal regulators. They pointed to Michael and Chantell Sackett, the Idaho couple blocked from building a home on a vacant lot that sat across the road from scenic Priest Lake.

In 2004 the couple bought a lot that sat about 300 feet from the lake. Near the back of the property were wetlands that drained into the lake. The couple had done excavation work in the past, and they dumped gravel and sand in a soggy part of the lot as a first step toward building a home.

But in response to a 2007 complaint, an official from the EPA warned them their land contained protected wetlands.

Pacific Legal took up their case, and after losing in the 9th Circuit Court, it urged the Supreme Court to hear the appeal and to rein in the law.

“The Sacketts’ property contains no stream, river, lake, or similar waterbody,” Schiff argued in its brief. “The Sacketts’ ordeal is emblematic of all that has gone wrong with implementation of the Clean Water Act.”

In defense of the EPA, Justice Department lawyers said “wetlands such as swamps, bogs, marshes and fens ... play a critical role in regulating water quality. They provide flood control and trap and filter sediment and other pollutants that would otherwise be carried into downstream waters.”

The court’s conservative majority has shown itself to be skeptical of broad federal regulation. In June, the court blocked the EPA from adopting rules that would fight climate change by forcing a shift away from coal-fired power plants.

The Natural Resources Defense Council argued that wetlands are crucial because they “keep rivers, lakes, and streams clean. And they reduce flood damage and provide invaluable habitat for the nation’s abundant wildlife.” If the court limits the scope of the law, “tens of millions of acres and countless other waters will lose federal safeguards that protect the health of our nation’s waterways,” the group said.",Election
latimes,Election,9389,latimes,"After hundreds of interviews, nine hearings and nearly 18 months of work, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol held its final hearing Monday ahead of the release of a report detailing its findings.

“I believe, nearly two years later, this is still a time of reflection and reckoning,” said Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.). “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.”

Thompson said that while the report — which the committee voted to adopt on Monday — will make a number of policy recommendations to prevent another Jan. 6, ensuring future attacks don’t happen will require “accountability” through the criminal justice system. The committee voted to recommend criminal charges against former President Trump, lawyer John Eastman and others.

“We have every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice,” he said.

After opening statements from Thompson and Vice Chair Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the committee played a short video laying out the key findings from past hearings: Trump knew that he lost the 2020 election even as he tried to overturn the results by pressuring state officials, election workers, the Department of Justice and then-Vice President Mike Pence; Trump urged the mob to go to the Capitol; and he waited 187 minutes to release a video asking his supporters to leave.

Here are the key points the committee made during its final hearing.

Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said that the panel’s subcommittee tasked with looking into criminal referrals would recommend criminal charges against Trump and Eastman.

The subcommittee proposed recommending the Department of Justice charge Trump, Eastman and others with obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Raskin said the committee is also recommending that the Justice Department charge Trump with conspiracy to make a false statement and efforts to “incite” or “assist” in an insurrection.

“We propose to the committee advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, the severity of its actual harm and the centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election compel us to speak,” Raskin said. “Ours is not a system of justice where the foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”

Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose) said that Trump used money raised from supporters to hire attorneys and “provide or offer employment to witnesses.”

Lofgren said one witness was told by a lawyer that she could tell the committee she couldn’t recall events that she did, in fact, remember. According to Lofgren, the witness said that lawyer declined to state who was paying for his representation. Another witness said she was approached with a lucrative potential employment opportunity ahead of her testimony by entities tied to Trump, but the job didn’t pan out.

“These offers were withdrawn or didn’t materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated,” Lofgren said. “The witness believed this was an effort to affect her testimony and we are concerned that these efforts may have been a strategy to prevent the committee from learning the truth.”

Several witnesses, including former Atty. Gen. William Barr, have testified that they told Trump there was no evidence of widespread election fraud that would have changed the outcome of the election. Monday’s hearing featured video testimony from a new witness, former White House communications director Hope Hicks.

“I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Hicks told the committee of the former president.

In response, Hicks said Trump replied with “something along the lines of ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose … the only thing that matters is winning.’”",Election
latimes,Election,9216,latimes,"Devin Nunes made his resignation from Congress official over the weekend, clearing the way for him to take over as chief executive of former President Trump’s new media and technology company.

In a letter addressed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), Nunes said his resignation as a member of Congress was effective 11:59 p.m. Saturday, according to a copy of the correspondence obtained by The Times. Pelosi’s office received the letter Monday.

“It has been the honor of my life to represent the people of California’s San Joaquin Valley for the last 19 years,” wrote Nunes, a Republican from Tulare.

Nunes is taking over as the top executive of Trump Media & Technology Group, which in the coming weeks is expected to launch Truth Social, Trump’s answer to Twitter and Facebook. The social media companies kicked the former president off their platforms last year for his role in inciting the attack on the U.S. Capitol and efforts to overturn the presidential election.

Trump’s firm describes its venture as “America’s ‘Big Tent’ social media platform” and says it “intends to even the playing field by providing people with open media platforms where they can share and create content without fear of repetitional ruin.”

The new gig for Nunes solidifies the 48-year-old’s place as a key member of Trump’s inner circle, underscoring the importance the former president frequently places on loyalty over relevant experience, so much so that he has given Nunes the reins of a company that values itself at $875 million.

A review of Nunes’ congressional record reveals his rapid rise from backbencher to media executive should not come as a surprise — the former dairy farmer wasted little time becoming one of Trump’s staunchest political allies and waged battle on the former president’s behalf against the Justice Department, Democrats and social media companies.

“In some ways, he’s one of the more unlikelier figures you would’ve seen going full Trump and full MAGA of the sitting members of Congress,” said Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican consultant who has followed Nunes’ ascent. “It seems a bit unpredictable that this would end up being the trajectory of his congressional career.”

Nunes entered Congress in 2003 after winning a tough primary against a state lawmaker and a former mayor for a newly drawn congressional district in the San Joaquin Valley.

For his first six terms, Nunes kept a low national profile, focusing his legislative energy on battling with environmentalists over water policies that he said harmed farmers.

“Before Donald Trump became president, Devin Nunes was actually pretty focused on local issues,” said Thomas Holyoke, a political science professor at Fresno State University. “Devin was sponsoring videos on how farms were going dry here in the valley in order to save small fish up in the delta region and how the environmentalists were all crazy wackos who wanted nothing less than to completely destroy agriculture. That’s really where he made his big mark and won a tremendous amount of support in parts of the valley, on the water issues.”

Nunes gradually turned his attention toward national security, a move that would put him firmly in Trump’s orbit. In 2015, he became chairman of the influential House Intelligence Committee.

After Trump won the party nomination that year, Nunes drove to the Bay Area and met with the candidate, joining him on a flight to Los Angeles and then to Tulare for a presidential campaign fundraiser. Shortly after that, Nunes joined the executive committee of Trump’s transition team.

Nunes’ role atop the Intelligence Committee gave him an influential platform to defend the president against allegations that Russia had aided Trump’s campaign.

Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III ultimately concluded that the Trump campaign welcomed Russian help in the 2016 campaign but did not engage in a criminal conspiracy with the Kremlin.

Nunes was a fierce critic of Mueller and accused the FBI of violating rules in its investigation. His committee’s Republican majority wrote a memo raising concerns “with the legitimacy and legality of” the Justice Department’s and FBI’s use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act during the 2016 election cycle.

When Mueller’s report was released in April 2019, Nunes alleged the special counsel “ignored a wide range of abuses committed during the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign,” and echoed Trump in bashing the investigation as the “Russia hoax.”

Nunes didn’t just spar with the Justice Department. He shared Trump’s disdain for mainstream media outlets and social media companies, decrying what he has described as their anti-conservative bias, and has repeatedly sued news organizations alleging defamation.

When House Democrats impeached the former president in late 2019 on allegations he pressured an ally to dig up dirt on future President Biden , Nunes again was one of Trump’s most vociferous defenders, accusing the opposing party of waging “a carefully orchestrated media smear campaign.”

Trump rewarded Nunes’ loyalty on Jan. 4 of last year with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The White House credited the Intelligence Committee chairman with unearthing what it called “the crime of the century,” a reference to alleged FBI malfeasance in its Russia investigation, and described the congressman as a “public servant of unmatched talent.”

Two days later, a pro-Trump mob swarmed the U.S. Capitol, battling police officers and contributing to the deaths of five people, all in an unsuccessful effort to block Congress from certifying Biden’s victory. Later that day, after the Capitol had been cleared of rioters, Nunes joined 138 other House Republicans in objecting to the presidential election results.

Democrats in the House were joined by 10 Republicans in impeaching Trump last January on allegations that he incited the insurrection. Trump was acquitted in the Senate by a 57-43 vote, short of the 67 votes required to convict him.

Nunes, who voted against impeachment, told Fox News that the entire process was “nonsense,” adding that “the president makes a lot of mistakes. All presidents make mistakes.”",Election
latimes,Election,9230,latimes,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy endorsed the GOP primary challenger to Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney on Thursday, his latest show of fealty to former President Trump as Republicans try to take control of Congress.

McCarthy did not mention Cheney by name as he announced he was backing attorney Harriet Hageman in the August primary.

“The most successful representatives in Congress focus on the needs of their constituents, and throughout her career, Harriet has championed America’s natural resources and helped the people of Wyoming reject burdensome and onerous government overreach,” the Bakersfield Republican said.

Hageman — once a Cheney ally — did not hold back, saying that Cheney has become an ineffective leader and was being used by Democrats to “achieve their partisan goals.”

“Cheney is doing nothing to help us, she is actively damaging the Republican Party — both in Wyoming and nationally — and it’s time for her to go,” said Hageman, who has frequently battled the federal government over its environmental policies and unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2018.

A Cheney spokesman pointed to comments from prominent Wyoming journalists deriding the weight of a California politician’s endorsement to Hageman’s prospects.

“Wow, she must be really desperate,” spokesman Jeremy Adler said.

McCarthy’s move against Cheney is not surprising. Though the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney overwhelmingly supported Trump’s policies, she became an outspoken critic of his claims that the 2020 election was rigged and of his role in urging his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The effort to stop the certification of the election results turned violent, with some of the protesters storming the Capitol, chanting for Vice President Mike Pence to be hanged and injuring more than 150 law enforcement officers.

Cheney was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the insurrection, and is one of two Republicans serving on the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol.

In the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, McCarthy said Trump bore some responsibility for the events that occurred that day. But he later walked back his comments, and he refused to cooperate with the House committee.

Cheney, the onetime darling of Wyoming GOP voters, has suffered consequences for her break with the former president: Trump has backed Hageman in the August primary. She was ousted from her position on McCarthy’s leadership team. The Wyoming GOP Central Committee no longer recognizes her as a member of the party. And this month, the Republican National Committee voted to censure her in a resolution that described the events of Jan. 6 as “legitimate public discourse.”

Unlike Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who criticized the RNC for censuring one of its elected officials and for the language of the resolution, McCarthy at first avoided weighing in. At the end of last week, he predicted Cheney would not run for reelection. Some have also speculated that Cheney will run for president in 2024, rumors that she has not denied.

Nor has she backed down after being attacked by leaders of her party. When Trump announced his support for Hageman in September and called Cheney a “warmonger and disloyal Republican,” she responded on Twitter: “Here’s a sound bite for you: Bring it.”",Election
latimes,Election,9237,latimes,"A federal judge on Wednesday handed an incremental victory to the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection in a case involving California attorney John Eastman.

Eastman, who advised former President Trump on efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, has been fighting to prevent the committee from seeing more than 100 emails involving him.

The judge ruled against Eastman for now, saying the court would review the documents to determine which can be turned over to the panel.

Eastman has emerged as a central figure in the committee’s investigation into Trump’s efforts to subvert the election results.

He wrote two legal memos arguing that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to unilaterally reject electoral votes or delay their counting, which could have opened the door for Republican-led state legislatures to cast their votes for Trump even though more voters cast their ballots for Joe Biden. The advice was disregarded by Pence and roundly denounced by legal experts when it became public last year.

The congressional committee subpoenaed emails sent or received by Eastman from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, 2021.

Eastman sued to block release of the documents, which are housed on the server of Chapman University in Orange, which was Eastman’s employer at the time. He argued that they’re protected from disclosure by attorney-client privilege and related legal rules.

“After reading the emails, the Court will determine for each document whether any privilege existed, whether that privilege was waived, and whether any exceptions apply,” wrote U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who is based in Santa Ana.

“Ultimately, the Court will issue a written decision including its full analysis and its final determination of which, if any, documents must be disclosed to the Select Committee.”

The committee had argued for the court review of 111 disputed emails in a hearing on Tuesday, which also offered more insight into the panel’s theory of potential criminal charges against Trump, which was first revealed last week in a court filing pertaining to Eastman’s lawsuit.

In that filing, the committee alleged that the emails it was seeking from Eastman could show that Trump broke multiple laws by seeking to block the certification of Biden’s win despite knowing that his claims of fraud were unfounded.

The committee said attorney-client privilege between Eastman and Trump would not apply to evidence demonstrating crime or fraud.

Charles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman, acknowledged in the hearing it was likely the judge would review the documents and tamped down expectations the emails would reveal blatant wrongdoing.

“There’s not going to be an email where anyone involved in the campaign effort says, ‘We’ve got to have some ruffians rush the Capitol if the vice president doesn’t make the decision we want.’ It’s not going to be there,” Burnham said.

“There’s not going to be an email that says, ‘We all know the election had no fraud or illegality, but we’ve got to come up with something.’”

Douglas Letter, counsel for the House select committee, said while they didn’t expect the emails would show such flagrant violations, there was already information that points to fraud or criminal intent.

He cited an email to Pence’s counsel, Greg Jacob, in which Eastman said Trump had been advised there was nothing supporting his allegations of electoral fraud, but “once [Trump] gets something in his head, it’s hard to get him to change course.”

“That’s pretty strong evidence ... that Trump was ignoring all of the very clear evidence because he wanted something different,” Letter said. “He wanted the vice president to do something that was plainly against the Constitution.

Carter, in his order, did not address the committee’s allegations of criminal or fraudulent activity. He said the panel raised sufficient questions about whether Eastman’s emails would be shielded under attorney-client privilege or as work product made in anticipation of a lawsuit.

While the ruling advances the committee’s efforts, Carter noted that “reading the emails does not mean that the Court will ultimately require disclosure.” The order did not specify when it will determine which emails should be turned over to congressional investigators.

The hearing also involved an attorney for Chapman University, where Eastman served as law professor and onetime dean of the law school.

An uproar over Eastman’s involvement with Trump, including his appearance at a pro-Trump rally immediately preceding the insurrection at the Capitol, prompted the professor to retire abruptly one week after Jan. 6.",Election
latimes,Election,9336,latimes,"Election day has finally arrived, and with it, the end of this unsettled campaign season is in sight. That’s not to say the results will come quickly. In fact, in many key races across the country, it could take days or weeks to count ballots — so be wary of any premature declarations of victory.

While the nation waits for polls to close — and then waits and waits some more — here’s a primer on the key questions of this election cycle.

Will there be a ‘red wave’ in the House?

The fundamentals of this election have always been in Republicans’ favor. Historical precedent is not kind to the party that occupies the White House during a midterm election and stubborn inflation and President Biden’s lackluster approval ratings haven’t done the Democrats any favors. In recent weeks, polls show these economic concerns are top of mind, especially for crucial independent voters.

Republicans only need five seats to win the House majority and most projections have them easily clearing that bar, with estimates ranging from 12 to 30 pickups. Whether this qualifies as a “red wave” will come down to the margins — a House chamber with a narrow Republican majority will have a far different tone than one dominated by the GOP. Republicans are even competing in districts where Biden beat President Trump by double digits, such as Rep. Katie Porter’s Orange County seat.

Poor performance in blue states is a bleak sign for Democrats, although some of their incumbents in swing or red states are holding their own in polling — which may help them avoid a bigger wipeout. A true wave would wipe out these vulnerable Democrats as well.

Will the tide turn in the Senate?

Democrats have virtually no room for error to maintain their control of the Senate, and their most vulnerable incumbents are locked in tight races based on public polling. But the party’s prospects are better than they are in the House, largely because Senate races tend to be more shaped by individual candidates than national dynamics.

Over the summer, GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell downplayed expectations that his party would win back the chamber, citing “candidate quality.” Some Republican contenders in the most competitive races made it through their primary with the power of Trump’s endorsement, even if they did not have the broadest appeal to the general electorate. Candidates such as Blake Masters in Arizona and Don Bolduc in New Hampshire were seen as relatively weak candidates to take on their state’s otherwise vulnerable incumbents, Sens. Mark Kelly and Maggie Hassan.

But political gravity still has pull and the Arizona and New Hampshire races have tightened. The GOP is particularly hopeful that Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto will fall to Adam Laxalt, the Republican former state attorney general, and that football star Herschel Walker will oust Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock. There’s a possibility Georgia voters would have to go to the polls again on Dec. 6 if neither Walker nor Warnock gets more than 50% of the vote; a run-off is required under state law if no candidate gets a majority.

Democrats have some pick-up opportunities as well, most notably in Pennsylvania. Their candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, is squaring off against Mehmet Oz, the well-known television doctor. Oz’s popularity took a beating during a rough GOP primary, but Fetterman’s candidacy was hobbled by a serious stroke, which he continues to recover from.

Who will be the governors in the 2024 battlegrounds?

Every major battleground state is holding governor’s races this year, with ripple effects that could be felt in the 2024 presidential race. Trump acolytes such as Kari Lake in Arizona and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania have refused to accept the results of the 2020 presidential race, raising questions of whether they would respect the outcome of future elections. While Mastriano, a GOP state legislator, has trailed substantially in polling behind Democratic state Atty. Gen. Josh Shapiro, Lake, a former newscaster, has had a much stronger showing against Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s current secretary of state.

In the upper Midwest, Democrats Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Tony Evers of Wisconsin are trying to fend off challenges from Trump-backed candidates Tudor Dixon and Tim Michels, respectively. Whitmer’s race in particular could have big implications for a rising star of the party. And speaking of rising stars, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is favored to easily beat Democrat Charlie Crist, but an especially large margin of victory could help play into a potential 2024 bid.

What does this mean for how we conduct elections?

Secretary of state races are usually sleepy affairs, but Trump’s persistent lies about election fraud have put new light on this position. Several GOP election deniers are running in battlegrounds, such as Mark Finchem in Arizona and Jim Marchant in Nevada. Their vows to overhaul election administration could upend the presidential race in key states.

If these candidates win, the implications could be vast. Republicans have been trying to curtail early voting and mail ballots, a voting method that was once predominantly used by GOP voters until Trump complained about alleged election fraud. Some of the most prominent election denier candidates, citing baseless voting machine conspiracies, have also called for lengthy hand counts of ballots, which experts say could lead to delayed and inaccurate tallies. Others have said they would not have upheld the results of the 2020 election, calling into doubt if they would certify races in the future.",Election
latimes,Election,9350,latimes,"Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, defeated Republican tech investor Blake Masters in one of the hardest-fought Senate races of the election season.

The race was called Friday by the Associated Press.

With the win in Arizona, Democrats are just one seat away from retaining their 50-seat majority in the Senate. The Nevada contest between Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto and her GOP challenger, Adam Laxalt, remains too close to call, and a fellow Democratic incumbent, Sen. Raphael Warnock, will face off against Herschel Walker in a runoff in Georgia next month.

Republicans would need to win both races to claim control of the Senate.

Kelly, on his campaign Twitter account, posted a succinct reaction: “Thank you, Arizona.”

Masters did not comment on Twitter, but earlier in the evening he lashed out during an appearance on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program at GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell and other establishment Republicans, calling them “incompetent” for not sufficiently supporting his campaign.

“Had he chosen to spend money in Arizona, this race would be over. We’d be celebrating a Senate majority right now,” Masters said.

Once consistently GOP territory, Arizona has stutter-stepped into battleground status in recent elections, siding with Joe Biden over President Trump by just over 10,000 votes two years ago. It has also been fertile ground for 2020 election conspiracy theories, creating a combustible political environment with multiple high-profile statewide races at stake.

Trump exerted significant pull in the Republican primaries, propelling his picks, including gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and secretary of state hopeful Mark Finchem, to the general election. AP declared Democrat Adrian Fontes the winner over Finchem on Friday.

Masters, a 36-year-old political novice, similarly owed his success in the primary to Trump’s endorsement, as well as ample financial backing from tech titan Peter Thiel. But his candidacy prompted concerns among the GOP establishment that his embrace of Trump’s election lies and a call to privatize Social Security would be a drag on his candidacy.

Kelly, who eked out a 2-percentage-point win in a special election in 2020, took advantage of Masters’ more extreme positions, including hard-line antiabortion stances and comments he made disparaging the military.

A former astronaut, Kelly entered politics several years after his wife, then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), was wounded by a gunman in 2011.

Republicans sought to paint Kelly as a loyal ally of Biden, who has a dismal approval rating in Arizona. In Washington, he was a reliable Democratic vote — a contrast to his fellow Arizona Democrat, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who often upended her party’s agenda.

Still, Kelly, 58, sought to differentiate himself from Biden over immigration, criticizing the White House’s handling of security on the southern border.

The days-long suspense over the outcome of the race led Republicans to grouse about the slow counting of the ballots, particularly in Maricopa County. The Republican National Committee, as well as the state GOP, threatened legal action Friday if the county, the largest in the state, did not commence round-the-clock counting and more frequent updates of the results.

County officials countered by saying that multi-day counting is the norm in the state, given widespread use of mail-in ballots.

Kelly jumped out to an early lead in the vote tallying thanks to Democratic-leaning mail ballots, but Masters chipped into that deficit as votes cast on election day were counted. Masters’ performance lagged compared with that of GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, who trails Katie Hobbs, the Democratic secretary of state, by less than two percentage points.

The governor’s race remained uncalled as of Friday evening.

Reacting to Masters’ loss, Trump complained, baselessly, that the election was stolen from Masters — much as he did when he lost the presidential race two years ago.

“Do Election over again!” he inveighed on Truth Social, his social media network.",Election
latimes,Election,9334,latimes,"Don’t expect to learn the results of this year’s midterm contests on election night.

Just as in 2020, we’re in for a drawn-out election week, followed by election month — or even months.

One reason is the popularity of mail-in ballots and the infuriating oddity that some states wait until all the polls are closed to begin counting them.

But this year’s results are also likely to be delayed by a pernicious practice: election denialism among Republican candidates loyal to former President Trump.

For them, it’s not enough to endorse Trump’s baseless insistence that he was the real winner of the 2020 presidential election — a bogus claim that has become a tenet of GOP faith.

Some election deniers sound ready to emulate their exiled leader if they, too, come up short.

When reporters ask these candidates whether they’ll accept the results if they lose, they evade or obfuscate.

“I sure hope I can,” said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who’s in a tight race for reelection. “But I can’t predict what the Democrats might have planned,” he added, suggesting they may try “to make it easier to cheat.”

Kari Lake, the Trump-backed candidate for governor of Arizona, added a Trump-style caveat.

“I’m going to win the election, and I will accept that result,” she said.

Arizona secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem was more direct: “Ain’t going to be no concession speech coming from this guy.”

On one level, it sounds as if all of these candidates are simply modeling themselves after Trump, who refused to commit to accepting election results in 2016 and 2020. (He eventually accepted the 2016 outcome, which he won, but still insisted that the vote had been rigged against him.)

But their preemptive refusals also prepare the way for a blizzard of postelection challenges in the courts — which is, of course, every candidate’s legal right. GOP officials, leaving nothing to chance, say they have already recruited more election lawyers than ever before.

After the 2020 election, Trump and his lawyers filed more than 60 lawsuits to try to overturn the results — and lost all but one.

This time, the political climate could influence the outcomes, UC Irvine law professor Richard L. Hasen worries.

“Pressure may come to bear on state judges and state supreme court justices, many of whom are elected officials and know that the Republican base is full of election deniers,” Hasen wrote in the Atlantic last week.

Another election expert, Rachel Orey of the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank, worries about a different scenario: GOP-dominated election boards at the county or state level could simply refuse to certify results they don’t like.

That happened in New Mexico and Pennsylvania after this year’s primary elections, although state supreme courts reversed the boards’ actions.

“That’s what’s keeping me up at night,” Orey said. “Certification has traditionally been a routine step … but that part of the process is now being abused by partisan actors to disrupt and delay.”

Not all Republicans have refused to say they would accept defeat. Senate candidates Herschel Walker in Georgia and Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania have both said they would accept the voters’ verdict.

In Colorado, GOP Senate candidate Joe O’Dea said not only that he would take defeat like a grown-up, but that Trump should, too.

“We’ve become a nation of whiners and crybabies,” he said in a written statement. “Donald Trump still can’t admit he lost.”

He added, for good measure, that he hopes Trump doesn’t win the GOP presidential nomination if he decides to run in 2024.

That earned him a blast from Trump, who called him a “RINO” — Republican in Name Only.

“MAGA doesn’t Vote for stupid people with big mouths,” the former president wrote on his social media outlet, using an abbreviation for his “Make America Great Again” movement.

O’Dea’s campaign manager, Zack Roday, said the candidate is still taking heat from Trump loyalists.

“He definitely gets pulled aside and read the riot act,” Roday told me. “But Joe’s a good listener.”

Republicans who concede their races risk being derided as RINOs, while those who challenge the results, even when there’s no credible evidence of fraud, may be rewarded by their party.

“The incentives are misaligned. Trump taught candidates that election denialism is [an] effective fundraising and campaign tactic,” Orey said. “Candidates who refuse to accept election results with no evidence are putting temporary political gain above the future of American democracy.”",Election
latimes,Election,9382,latimes,"Alexandra Pelosi was having one of those days.

She’s still raw from the hammer attack on her father by a QAnon crazy. “I have not slept through the night since,” Pelosi confessed.

A recent morning found her whipping up a Betty Crocker birthday cake, readying her New York apartment for an invasion of teenage girls and vacuuming the broken glass from a toppled Christmas tree, all while fending off a sister demanding to know why that was included in the new documentary she produced on their famous mother.

The trailer had just come out.

“I’m doing PR management in my own family,” a harried Pelosi said, as a cheery “Happy Birthday” banner — hung in honor of her 15-year-old — did its best to brighten things.

Pelosi, the youngest of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s five children, is a filmmaker who launched her career with the cheeky documentary “Journeys with George,” a verite look at the 2000 presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. She spent months living on the campaign charter, as a camcorder-toting producer for NBC News. Pelosi has since created more than a dozen documentaries, on such topics as child poverty, big money in politics and the effects of the tech boom on San Francisco, where she was born and raised.

With a camera as her constant companion — and occasional irritant to those around her — Pelosi filmed thousands of hours of her mother, in public settings and private moments, doing housework and the work of House speaker. The finished product begins airing Tuesday on HBO.

“This is my view and it’s my movie,” Pelosi said, noting some in her family might have preferred a more worshipful look at their path-breaking parent. She said the speaker — whom she repeatedly referred to, with professional distance, as “Nancy Pelosi” — wasn’t a particularly cooperative subject.

“If I tried to ask her a question, she never plays ball with me,” Pelosi said. “She never gave me permission to film. She always said, ‘Why are you filming all this?’ She never understood. So it wasn’t authorized, she never signed a release... She saw the trailer, she told me, ‘You should take out this, this and this.’

“I go, ‘Mom, the trailer’s on YouTube,’” Pelosi said in the tone of exasperated offspring the world over.

Not, she noted, that the speaker had any say in the matter.

At 52, Pelosi has her mother’s hummingbird energy, traces of the speaker’s husky voice and a speeding-subway-train delivery that’s more New York than California. She spoke via Zoom, wearing a purple turtleneck — her trademark color — with the tumbled Christmas tree and scattered presents just off-camera.

Pelosi described her latest project as a happy accident growing out of a 2018 conversation in the HBO cafeteria with Geof Bartz, a frequent collaborator and the network’s supervising editor for documentaries. She mentioned her extensive catalog of family footage, and Bartz agreed to take a look and see if there was something there.

That November, Democrats took control of the House, and Pelosi was installed for a second history-making go-round as speaker. The documentary’s perspective shifted from a look back on Pelosi’s career to a more contemporaneous account of her battles with then-President Trump, culminating in the Jan. 6 raid on Congress by insurrectionists seeking to overturn the 2020 election.

In October, the House committee investigating the failed coup released snippets of iPhone footage Alexandra Pelosi shot that day, showing lawmakers fleeing for their lives and desperately seeking assistance to quell the riot. At one point, a furious Nancy Pelosi said she wanted to punch Trump, who incited the violence and blithely watched his marauding supporters on TV.

The tinfoil-hat crowd has seized on Alexandra Pelosi’s presence as somehow proving the whole thing — the desecration of the Capitol, the assault on democracy — was staged. No surprise there. She’s prepared, Pelosi said, for that kind of crazy, as well as efforts to embarrass her mother by turning her work into a mockumentary spoofing the life and unflattering times of the speaker.

“I know that Tucker Carlson will pick out, like, the most silly moments and exploit it for his own political purposes,” Pelosi said of the Fox News hatemonger. “And then all of his followers will go online and destroy my film to ensure it doesn’t get taken seriously as a documentary. And that’s fine. I’m a big girl, I’m wearing my big-girl pants, I couldn’t care less.

“What I do care about,” and here she paused for several seconds, “is that I don’t want them to break into my house and attack me in the middle of the night.”

It was no idle thought.

Pelosi, who has been targeted with a steady stream of death threats, lives now with security outside her apartment. Her teenagers have received death threats as well. She described walking down the street with them and being accosted by strangers demanding answers to some of the ludicrous, conspiratorial questions Carlson and his fellow trolls have raised about the attack on her father.

“There’s this very toxic, negative energy circulating around my family,” Pelosi said matter-of-factly, “and we live with it.”

The release of “Pelosi in the House” could have been a triumphant moment, marrying Alexandra Pelosi’s artistic eye with a lifetime’s worth of unparalleled access to one of the most powerful and important women in U.S. history. The documentary — with its chilling images of Jan. 6, its intimate sausage-making look at the legislative process, its charming mother-daughter banter — is genuinely revealing.

But Pelosi isn’t looking for rave reviews, or to send TV ratings through the roof.

“All I care about,” she said, “is that I physically survive the release of this film.”",Election
latimes,Election,9365,latimes,"Democratic Rep. Mike Levin has won reelection in a coastal congressional district that straddles Orange and San Diego counties.

Levin beat Brian Maryott, a Republican businessman and former San Juan Capistrano mayor, in a rematch of the 2020 contest. The Associated Press called the race Wednesday, though official results will take longer.

Levin on Wednesday thanked his family, volunteers and supporters, and he also praised Maryott. (The two live in the same town and attend the same church.)

“A thriving democracy requires competition for citizens’ votes, and to those who voted for Mr. Maryott, I want to reassure you that my door is always open,” Levin said in a statement. “I welcome opportunities to work together because the best legislation is always that with the broadest input. I firmly believe that Representative is not just my job title, it’s also my job description.”

Maryott’s campaign did not return requests for comment.

The contest had appeared so close that President Biden campaigned with Levin just days before the election — a sign of Democrats’ concern about holding on to the seat as they battled for control of the House, which tipped to Republicans on Wednesday.

The 49th Congressional District stretches from Laguna Beach to Del Mar and includes Camp Pendleton and a mothballed nuclear power plant. It’s one of several blue-state districts that overwhelmingly supported Biden in 2020 and were targeted by Republicans in the midterm election. The GOP had hoped Biden’s low approval ratings and the nation’s economic straits would boost their candidates.

Democrats have a scant 3.1-percentage-point edge in voter registration in the district, which is home to many commuters. Much of Maryott’s campaign focus was on pocketbook matters at a time of surging inflation and high gas prices.

Levin, who worked as an environmental attorney before being elected to the House in 2018, has pushed a bold clean-energy agenda, supporting zero-emission vehicles and banning new drilling off the California coast.

But he has also prioritized issues that are of particular importance to the district’s voters, including improving services for veterans and moving the radioactive waste buried at the closed San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.

After his race was called Wednesday, Levin in his statement mentioned his work on healthcare, climate change, veterans services, semiconductors and infrastructure.

“I am particularly honored to have been able to work across the aisle to build bipartisan, common-sense coalitions to tackle many of these issues,” he said. “There is much more to be done, and I look forward to the challenge.”",Election
latimes,Election,9264,latimes,"Gov. Gavin Newsom is launching his first television ad of the general election on Monday, but not in California. The ad will air thousands of miles away, in Florida, further fueling speculation that he wants to run for president — or, at a minimum, to troll the state’s Republican leaders.

In the ad, Newsom contrasts the policies in California and Florida while images flash of former President Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis, potential 2024 presidential candidates.

“Freedom, it’s under attack in your state. Republican leaders, they’re banning books, making it harder to vote, restricting speech in classrooms, even criminalizing women and doctors,” Newsom says in the 30-second spot. “I urge all of you living in Florida to join the fight, or join us in California, where we still believe in freedom — freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate and the freedom to love.”

Newsom’s gubernatorial campaign is spending about $105,000 to air the ad on Fox News stations around the state, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political advertisements. The ad is running on Independence Day, when most voters are unlikely to be glued to their television sets.

The size of the ad buy is a pittance for the governor, whose reelection campaign had more than $23 million as of May 21, according to the latest filings with the secretary of state’s office. Newsom is heavily favored in the fall election over his conservative Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle, from Northern California.

The move, which was rolled out on CNN on Sunday, appears designed to draw national media attention. After Newsom tweeted the ad and the media began running stories, it had been viewed 1.4 million times on Twitter and 90,000 times on YouTube as of Sunday evening.

Newsom, 54, has repeatedly denied that he wants to run for president, but many political experts are skeptical, particularly considering the speculation, warranted or not, about President Biden’s plans to seek reelection.

During Trump’s presidency, Newsom served as a national foil, touting California policy on issues such as climate change. And in recent weeks, he has irked some of his fellow Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, by arguing that the party was being too passive on issues such as abortion. “Stop playing defense, Democrats,” he said in June.

Garry South, a Democratic strategist who worked for Gov. Gray Davis and on Newsom’s first, short-lived run for governor in 2009, noted that Republican elected officials have long tried to poach corporations from California.

“When Gray Davis was governor, we had Republican governors from other states in here every second Thursday, so I guess turnabout is fair play,” he said. “I don’t want to be too flippant about it. Now that we have red-state America and blue-state America and it’s getting more divided, there is a place for massively blue states like California where things are still sane; it makes sense to make forays into other states … and see what happens.”",Election
latimes,Immigration,9381,latimes,"Last week, Ukraine pulled off an audacious military feat: three drone strikes deep inside Russia, one against a target less than 150 miles from Moscow.

The drones attacked bases from which Russia has launched airstrikes against Ukraine’s cities, electricity grid and other infrastructure.

It’s not clear that they caused major damage; at least two airplanes were struck, and a fuel storage tank was set ablaze. But they revealed a surprising weakness in Russia’s air defenses.

Equally striking was Russia’s low-key response. There were no high-decibel denunciations or threats of retaliation, perhaps out of embarrassment or a desire to avoid rattling Russian civilians.

The Biden administration’s response was curious too. Nobody congratulated the plucky Ukrainians for the mission’s success. Instead, officials quickly made clear that the United States had nothing to do with it.

“We have neither encouraged nor enabled the Ukrainians to strike inside of Russia,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told reporters.

Other officials added that the United States has not supplied Ukraine with weapons that could reach as far as the drones flew.

The administration’s dour reaction to the drone attacks was in keeping with the self-imposed limits Biden’s team has observed as it has pumped billions of dollars in weaponry and economic aid to the embattled Kyiv government: No U.S. or other NATO troops in Ukraine; no NATO aircraft in Ukrainian airspace; no NATO-supplied weapons that can strike deep inside Russia.

The goal is to avoid crossing any boundaries Russian President Vladimir Putin might consider “red lines” — actions that might provoke him to retaliate against the West.

“We’re trying to avoid World War III,” President Biden has said repeatedly.

The result has been a tacit set of rules under which Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have shown a measure of restraint toward each other. NATO has poured military supplies into Ukraine; Russia has largely spared the supply convoys from direct attack, at least in areas near Ukraine’s border with Poland and other NATO countries.

In that sense, the policy has succeeded. Last month, when two missiles fell near a Polish village, U.S. officials quickly determined that they were Ukrainian rockets that had gone astray — a crisis averted.

But the unintended result of U.S. policy has been a war in which Ukraine and Russia fight under unequal rules.

The restraint Russia has shown toward NATO contrasts sharply with the apparent lack of limits on its bombardment of Ukrainian cities: Russia has struck residential neighborhoods, hospitals and schools, as well as legitimate military targets.

By contrast, until last week, Ukraine largely avoided firing on Russian territory, except for on a handful of ammunition dumps and fuel depots close to the frontier — all military targets.

One more curiosity: Nobody’s quite sure where Putin’s red lines are.

“They have been careful not to spell out red lines that they’ve been clear they’ll enforce,” Alexander R. Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told me. “They’ve gotten us to self-deter.”

Ukraine has tested the purported lines several times, with no apparent penalty. Moscow protested after Ukraine shelled military installations near Belgorod, about 25 miles inside Russian territory, but Kyiv was not deterred.

The United States has been more cautious. The administration has refused Ukraine’s repeated pleas for the Army Tactical Missile System, an advanced ground-to-ground missile with a range of almost 200 miles, for fear that Ukrainian units might fire across the border.

Providing ATACMS, as the missiles are known, would risk “heading down the road toward a Third World War,” Biden’s national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, explained in July.

But Ukraine has continued to ask for the missiles, and a growing number of critics, including members of Congress from both parties, have urged the administration to relax the prohibition.

“The administration has tended to err on the side of caution,” said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who favors supplying Ukraine with ATACMS.

Pifer has proposed a sensible compromise: The United States could provide Ukraine with the long-range missiles but prohibit Kyiv from firing them into Russia.

“ATACMS would be very effective inside Ukraine; they would make it far more difficult for the Russians to conduct the war,” he said. “ATACMS would force them to pull their artillery and their ammunition way back from the front lines.”

The prohibition against firing the missiles into Russia would be self-enforcing, he added.

“The Ukrainians would know that their access [to ATACMS] would end if they violated the rule.”

Providing those long-range missiles to Ukraine, even under restrictions, would have far greater military effect than last week’s drone strikes, which one expert dismissed as “boutique attacks.”

Russia is waging a war of attrition, trying to wear down Ukraine’s armed forces, demoralize its people and discourage its allies.

“Time is an important factor here,” Pifer warned. “The West’s economic sanctions against Russia haven’t had their full effect yet.

“Here’s the key question,” he added. “Will economic sanctions erode Russia’s will to fight before the damage to Ukraine’s economy and infrastructure erodes theirs?”

Ukraine still needs all the help it can get, beginning with economic aid and antiaircraft missiles — and including those ATACMS.",Immigration
latimes,Immigration,9317,latimes,"After more than a year of negotiation, settlement talks between the Biden administration and plaintiffs in a lawsuit over temporary protected status fell through on Tuesday, leaving more than 250,000 people at risk of deportation.

The litigation followed concerted actions by the Trump administration to end TPS for the citizens of several countries — El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan and Nepal — as part of its efforts to wind down extended use of the protections. TPS is a form of humanitarian relief granted to countries devastated by natural disasters or war and allows beneficiaries to work legally while they remain in the U.S. Created in 1990, the program currently applies to people from 15 countries.

The plaintiffs won temporary relief in 2018 when a federal district judge in San Francisco granted an injunction to block the termination of protections. But in 2020, a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed the order in a 2-1 decision. That hasn’t taken effect because lawyers for the immigrants requested a hearing before the full court, which remains pending.

The Biden administration redesignated temporary protected status for Haiti and Sudan, but has not done so for the four other countries. Those beneficiaries could lose their protections as early as the end of this year, while the Biden administration goes to court to defend the previous administration’s decisions.

As a presidential candidate, however, Joe Biden called President Trump’s decision to rescind TPS “a recipe for disaster,” promising to protect beneficiaries from being returned to unsafe countries. The Homeland Security and Justice departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Emi MacLean, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, said a settlement would have provided safety and security for the TPS holders who have felt vulnerable during the last four years of litigation.

“There is a reason that people are losing faith in the [Biden] administration,” she said. “These actions leave us very concerned about whether they recognize the urgency of this issue and the fact that many lives are on the line because of their unwillingness to act.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation but said that “current TPS holders from El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras will continue to be protected over the coming months.”

TPS holders and their U.S. citizen children brought the class-action challenge in 2018 alleging government officials had a political agenda in deciding to terminate protections for those countries and were motivated by racism. Trump administration officials countered by saying the program was never intended to provide a long-term reprieve.

Plaintiff Elsy Flores Ayala said she was frustrated that a settlement couldn’t be negotiated. Flores Ayala, 43, her husband and their 24-year-old daughter have had TPS since 2001, a year after they arrived in the U.S. from El Salvador.

El Salvador was first designated for TPS in March 2001 after two earthquakes ravaged the country, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing more than 1 million. Since then, the U.S. government has cited subsequent natural disasters and gang-related insecurity in redesignations. Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans have TPS, many of them in California.

Flores Ayala said she and her family, who live in Washington, depend on the benefits that come with TPS — she works in child care, her husband does maintenance at an apartment building and her daughter is in college. She also worries about what could happen if they lose the deportation protections. Her two youngest children, ages 17 and 21, were born in the U.S. and she fears being separated from them.

“The worry is significant because we don’t know what will happen with us,” she said.

In the pointed ruling in 2018, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocked the terminations, saying beneficiaries risked being uprooted from their homes, jobs and communities.

“They face removal to countries to which their children and family members may have little or no ties and which may not be safe,” he wrote. “Those with U.S.-citizen children will be confronted with the dilemma of either bringing their children with them, giving up their children’s lives in the United States (for many, the only lives they know), or being separated from their children.”

The judge, an appointee of President Obama, also cited Trump’s reported comments about Haitian and African immigrants being from “shithole countries,” noting “circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.”

Through the discovery process, lawyers for the immigrants received internal communications from the Homeland Security Department during the time the decisions for terminating TPS were made.

In one instance, then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke wrote in a personal memo in March 2018 that “the TPS program must end for these countries soon. … This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.”

Career diplomats and other experts cautioned at the time that the decisions would result in significant humanitarian and political repercussions, while a Homeland Security official suggested they comb through the conditions in those countries for “positive gems” to justify their arguments that recipients no longer needed legal protections.",Immigration
latimes,Immigration,9386,latimes,"As the Biden administration prepares to end the use of a Trump-era border measure that restricts access to asylum, most Americans continue to support protections for immigrants who are fleeing persecution and torture abroad.

By 55% to 23%, Americans say the U.S. should continue to offer asylum to people who arrive at the border, if they are found to be fleeing persecution, according to a new survey conducted for The Times by the YouGov polling organization.

Support for offering asylum crosses party lines, although Democrats are significantly more in favor of it, and Republicans are more closely divided.

A much wider partisan gap divides Americans on the question of how many of the people who seek asylum are actually fleeing persecution. Among Democrats, nearly half said most or all asylum seekers had valid claims. Only 1 in 6 Republicans took a similar view, the L.A. Times/YouGov poll found. More than 6 in 10 Republicans said that few or none of the asylum seekers had valid claims.

The L.A. Times/YouGov poll surveyed a nationally representative sample of 1,573 adult American citizens, who were interviewed online Dec. 9-14. The results have a margin of error of 3 percentage points in either direction.

The poll also found that most Americans continue to support Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that allows people who were brought to the U.S. as children to legally live and work in the U.S. The program is being challenged in court by Texas and several other Republican states.

Half of those surveyed said that DACA should continue, compared with 29% who said it should be ended. An additional 21% were not sure.

More than half of respondents — 55% — said that even if DACA ends, those covered by it should be allowed to continue to work and live legally in the United States.

The poll results come as Biden administration officials debate how to handle asylum cases in the future.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, border agents have used Title 42, a section of the public health code, to rapidly expel would-be immigrants at the border, often without considering their asylum claims. A federal judge has ordered the Biden administration to stop using the pandemic-era measure by Wednesday.

Although the public supports offering asylum to immigrants who are found to be fleeing persecution, Americans also think the process should move faster. More than 4 in 10 Americans said the asylum process shouldn’t take longer than 6 months; more than two-thirds said it should not take longer than a year.

Currently, asylum cases can take years to be heard in court.

The poll made clear that Americans continue to have little patience for President Biden’s handling of immigration. Just 8% of respondents said they strongly approve of Biden’s immigration policies; an additional 25% said they somewhat approve of them.

That’s a significantly less favorable judgment than the public’s overall view of Biden’s job performance: 40% of Americans approve, according to YouGov’s polling.

Most Americans have favorable or neutral opinions about immigration more broadly, according to the poll. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans think that immigration either makes the U.S. better off (35%) or doesn’t make much difference (23%).

Similarly, a majority of Americans support birthright citizenship, the constitutional provision that automatically grants U.S. citizenship to every child born in this country. That view is widespread, with support outpacing opposition among liberals and conservatives, white Americans and those of color and Democrats and Republicans.

There is a big exception: people who said they voted for Donald Trump in 2020. Those voters are closely divided, with 44% in favor of ending birthright citizenship and 41% opposed.

That finding is consistent with another finding of the poll — the sharply partisan divide on whether immigration helps or hurts the country.

While just over a third of Americans say immigration makes the country better off, 29%, including 52% of Trump voters and 49% of Republicans, believe immigration makes the country worse off.

These anti-immigration Americans make up around half of the GOP, and they support major changes to the country’s immigration laws.

Americans who believe that immigration makes the country worse off oppose birthright citizenship, 46% to 38%. They favor ending DACA, 60% to 28%. And they are much more likely than the general population to say that even legal immigration is a problem in the United States.

More than 4 in 10 among those who believe immigration makes the country worse off say legal immigration is a problem; only 17% of the general population agrees.

The politics of immigration appear set to shift with age, however. Millennial and Gen Z Americans — the two most diverse generations — have dramatically different views on immigration than their older counterparts.

Americans ages 45-64 and 65 and older have nearly identical views on immigration; 38% of each group believe that immigration makes the country worse off.

By contrast, only 15% of those under age 30 and 21% of those ages 30-44 think immigration makes the country worse off.

The difference among the age groups is driven more by changes among Republicans than among Democrats. Republicans under 30 are much more likely than older Republicans to believe that immigrants help the country. Forty-two percent of Republicans under 30 said that immigrants make the country better off.

Various studies have attempted to measure the effect of immigration on the economy. The Center for American Progress, a research group aligned with Democrats, providing a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would boost the nation’s gross domestic product.",Immigration
latimes,Immigration,9247,latimes,"The Republican Party has a storied history in California. The launching pad for Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon, the state remains home to many of the party’s wealthiest donors as well as nearly 5.3 million registered GOP voters (more than the population of 28 states). But the party has been in decline for many years, both in membership and ballot box success.

As California Republicans prepare to gather for their convention in Anaheim this weekend, here’s a look at the GOP and its upcoming electoral prospects:

What’s the state of the GOP in California?

Democrats had a nearly 23-percentage point voter registration edge over Republicans as of March. Voters who express no party preference have nearly caught up with the GOP in voter registration.

The Republican Party last elected statewide candidates in 2006 (Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner). It currently holds less than a quarter of state legislative seats and less than a fifth of the state’s congressional delegation. Last year’s effort to recall Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, which drew great enthusiasm among conservatives because enough voters signed petitions to qualify it for the ballot, failed by nearly 24 points.

Do conservative voters have any reasons for hope?

Despite its overwhelmingly Democratic tilt, the state is home to many conservatives. Former President Trump received more than 6 million votes in California in 2020 — the most of any state.

Republicans are hopeful because the GOP is widely expected to retake control of Congress due to President Biden’s low approval ratings, rising inflation and the historic trend that the party that controls the White House typically loses seats in the first midterm election during its tenure.

That means that Bakersfield’s Kevin McCarthy, the current House GOP leader and a devoted Trump ally, has a strong shot of becoming the next speaker of the House — second in line for the presidency after the vice president. He would also take the speaker’s gavel from San Francisco Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who is reviled among conservatives.

Can the GOP gain congressional seats in California?

Absolutely. Democrats have already booked millions of dollars of television air time on California congressional races in the fall, and Republicans are expected to follow suit.

Though it’s unclear whether these races will determine which party controls the House of Representatives, they will certainly determine the margin.

Republicans have prioritized defending the seats of Reps. Mike Garcia in northern Los Angeles County and David Valadao in the Central Valley — two of the most endangered GOP incumbents in the nation after the once-every-decade redrawing of district lines following the U.S. census. Additionally, they are trying to protect Orange County Rep. Michelle Steel, who is running in a district where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans, as well as Reps. Young Kim in Orange County and Ken Calvert in Riverside County.

The GOP is on offense in the redrawn congressional districts represented by Democratic Reps. Katie Porter in Orange County; Mike Levin, whose district straddles the border of Orange and San Diego counties; and Josh Harder in the Central Valley.

What about the party’s statewide prospects this year?

While 13 Republicans are challenging Newsom in his reelection bid, none are well known. Four are having receptions at the convention, including state Sen. Brian Dahle and businessman Anthony Trimino, who had a skywriter spell out “Unmask Our Kids” over the Super Bowl at SoFi Stadium earlier this year.

The most prominent Republicans who ran to replace Newsom in last year’s recall — talk-radio host Larry Elder, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley and businessman and 2018 Republican gubernatorial candidate John Cox — are sitting out the 2022 gubernatorial election. None is scheduled to appear at the convention, which opens Friday night.

The candidates running for other statewide offices, such as U.S. Senate, attorney general and treasurer, have little campaign cash and even less name identification among California voters. The sole exception may be state controller hopeful Lanhee Chen, an academic and GOP policy expert who is a big name in national political and donor circles, but is little known among the state’s voters.

What are some of the key events at this weekend’s gathering?

The party’s last convention, shortly after the failed recall, was grim.

This year’s is expected to be more celebratory, with candidates’ parties such as Steel’s chocolate and cigars reception. There will also be panels on issues such as education reform and courting minority and LGBTQ voters. Vendors will hawk jewelry and clothing featuring rhinestone elephants.

A speech by McCarthy, at Saturday night’s banquet, is anticipated to be a draw for delegates. The former state lawmaker is expected to discuss the Biden administration’s record, inflation and the midterm elections. Immigration is also likely to be raised as McCarthy prepares to lead a congressional delegation to the Southern border on Monday.

Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sole Black Republican member of the U.S. Senate, will make an appearance Friday night. Scott is viewed as a rising star and potential presidential candidate or vice presidential pick.",Immigration
latimes,Immigration,9391,latimes,"Acting on an emergency appeal from some Republican-led states, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a temporary order Monday that will preserve — for now — a Trump-era policy that turned away most migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.

The chief justice asked for a response from the Biden administration by the end of the day Tuesday.

It remains unclear whether Roberts or the full Supreme Court will make a decision on the appeal before Wednesday, when the so-called Title 42 rule is set to end.

Tens of thousands of migrants have been moving toward the border with Mexico, believing the rule would expire this week.

The Trump administration adopted the rule in response to the COVID-19 emergency and authorized the government to turn away migrants without giving them an asylum hearing. Title 42 refers to part of a U.S. public health law that allows the government to act during certain emergencies.

The Biden administration had said that as the pandemic eased, the restrictions may no longer be needed.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington set aside the rule, holding that it was no longer justified as a pandemic measure. His decision allowed for an appeal, but it was due to take effect Wednesday.

Arizona Atty. Gen. Mark Brnovich joined with 18 other states and filed an emergency appeal asking Roberts and the Supreme Court to intervene. He said the border states will see a surge of new migrants, and he argued the high court should hear the case first.

“No one reasonably disputes that the failure to grant a stay will cause a crisis of unprecedented proportions at the border,” he wrote. The Department of Homeland Security “estimates that daily illegal crossings may more than double from around 7,000/day to 15,000/day once Title 42 is terminated.”

He also argued that the Biden administration failed to vigorously defend the policy in court.

The White House had no immediate comment Monday.

Roberts said the restrictions would remain in place until the court acts.

In recent months, the Supreme Court has issued similar temporary administrative orders to give the justices a few days to hear from both sides in a case and decide what to do.

latimes,Immigration,9345,latimes,"Republican Rep. Young Kim, who in 2020 was one of the first Korean American women to be elected to Congress, fended off a challenge from Democrat Dr. Asif Mahmood to secure a second term.

Democrats had listed the affluent, suburban, mostly Orange County district as a target for flipping, despite Republicans’ more than 4-percentage-point voter registration advantage. However, the campaigns largely flew under the radar in recent months, outshined by competitive races in other Orange County districts.

The Associated Press called the race in California’s 40th Congressional District on Thursday, though official results will take longer.

“I look forward to continuing to break through the partisan gridlock, bring common sense to Washington and deliver results on behalf of all residents of CA-40, regardless of who you voted for,” she said in a statement. “There is much to do to get our country back on track, and I promise to never stop fighting to make life affordable, keep our communities safe and preserve the American dream for future generations.”

Kim’s messaging, which in previous campaigns focused on bipartisanship, moved further to the right this election cycle. The newly drawn district, which changed significantly in redistricting, is more conservative than her current one.

The Republican trumpeted her support for stricter border security, including former President Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy, which forced asylum seekers who reached the U.S. border from Mexico to wait there for their cases to be processed. Through advertisements and interviews she’s attempted to draw parallels between border security and rising crime and drug issues.

Kim lives just outside the district, which covers some of the most conservative cities in the county, including Yorba Linda and Villa Park. It also encompasses portions of Corona in Riverside County and Chino Hills in San Bernardino County. She has not represented a majority of the voters in the newly drawn district, in which 60% of residents eligible to vote are white.

Kim, who was born in South Korea, served in the state Assembly and unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2018 before winning two years later.

She broke with the majority of Republican members of Congress who objected to certifying the 2020 electoral votes from Pennsylvania. She voted against impeaching Trump and against forming a committee to investigate the Capitol insurrection.

Mahmood, a pulmonologist who was raised in rural Pakistan and has lived in Southern California since 1999, unsuccessfully ran for state insurance commissioner in 2018. He focused much of his campaign on reproductive rights, criticizing Kim in digital advertisements for her votes against protecting abortion access. Mahmood could not be reached for comment.",Immigration
latimes,Immigration,9347,latimes,"Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Chris Magnus said Friday he was asked to resign but is refusing to do so.

In a statement to The Times, Magnus said he was asked by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to step down or face firing. He said he was not and defended his record, including internal reforms, border security and pursuit policies.

“I am excited about the progress I made and look forward continuing that work,” he said.

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Magnus described in detail the events that led to the request.

On Wednesday, Mayorkas told Magnus he had lost confidence in Magnus in a conversation between the two. The meeting came after the commissioner had decided to not continue a “retention” bonus for the head of Border Patrol, Raul Ortiz. Magnus had told Mayorkas previously that Ortiz did not share his philosophy and approach to reforms.

On Tuesday, Magnus had also gone to a meeting of border patrol chiefs in El Paso after Mayorkas had ordered him not to, Magnus said.

“After me making extensive attempts to reach [Mayorkas] and discuss the matter, I went to the meeting so I could engage with the chiefs on various issues and concerns. I also met with Chief Ortiz to see how we might best work together moving forward,” he said.

In the meeting with Mayorkas on Wednesday, Magnus was told to resign or Mayorkas would recommend to President Biden that he be fired, Magnus said. Then, on Thursday, John Tien, the second in command at DHS, also told Magnus that he should resign or he would be fired within the next few days, he said.

“I expressed to him that I felt there was no justification for me to resign when I still cared deeply about the work I was doing and felt that that work was focused on the things I was hired to do in the first place,” Magnus said.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.

Magnus, a former Tucson and Richmond, Calif., police chief, said he knew that resignation was often the route others would have gone but that he would not.

His agency has faced criticism for the way it treats migrants as well as increases in the number of migrants coming to the border. He has focused on trying to reform the culture of the agency. There have been reports about internal criticism of his management style.",Immigration

latimes,Immigration,9397,latimes,"A divided Supreme Court refused Tuesday to lift the Trump-era rule that has turned away migrants at the border as a public health threat.

By a 5-4 vote, the justices granted an appeal from Arizona and 18 other Republican-led states that sought to keep Title 42 in place to prevent a new surge of migrants who seek to apply for asylum.

The court agreed to hear arguments in February from the GOP states, but its order said it did not “prevent” the Biden administration from taking steps to limit the disputed policy.

But the White House conceded its options are limited.

“The Supreme Court’s order today keeps the current Title 42 policy in place while the Court reviews the matter in 2023. We will, of course, comply with the order and prepare for the Court’s review,” said White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

Last month, a federal judge in Washington set aside the Trump rule adopted in March of 2020, holding it can no longer be justified now that the pandemic has faded. His decision would have lifted Title 42 and gave hope to thousands of migrants who had come to the U.S.-Mexican border anticipating they would be able to make a claim for asylum.

But the court on Tuesday blocked that decision from taking effect.

“This stay precludes giving effect to the District Court order setting aside and vacating the Title 42 policy; the stay itself does not prevent the federal government from taking any action with respect to that policy,” the court said in an unsigned order.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil M. Gorsuch and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented and said they would have allowed the Title 42 rule to end.

The majority, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts, did not explain the decision. But Gorsuch faulted the majority for relying on the COVID pandemic to justify a strict policy at the border.

The “current border crisis is not a COVID crisis. And courts should not be in the business of perpetuating administrative edicts designed for one emergency only because elected officials have failed to address a different emergency. We are a court of law, not policymakers of last resort,” he wrote in a dissent joined by Jackson.

The court’s order dashes the hopes of migrants who fled Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and other countries that are beset by chaos and political turmoil. Prior to March of 2020, migrants could apply for asylum, but the Title 42 rule allows them to be turned away before doing so.

Lee Gelernt, an attorney with the ACLU who led the lawsuit against Title 42, said that keeping “Title 42 will mean more suffering for desperate asylum seekers but hopefully this proves only to be a temporary set back in the court challenge.”

The Biden administration told the court that it was prepared to send more agents to the border to screen migrants who seek asylum and to turn back those who cannot show they are fleeing persecution.

However, the GOP states predicted a “crisis of unprecedented proportions at the border” if Title 42 is lifted.

The government concedes it does not have the space to detain the tens of thousands of migrants who pass the initial screening, and they are usually released until their hearing is scheduled before an immigration judge. That process usually takes many months or even several years.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement “the Title 42 public health order will remain in effect and individuals who attempt to enter the United States unlawfully will continue to be expelled to Mexico or their home country. People should not listen to the lies of smugglers who take advantage of vulnerable migrants, putting lives at risk. The border is not open, and we will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws.”

Until today, most of the court’s conservatives have been skeptical of the government’s use of the pandemic to enforce broad changes in the law. For example, they struck down a Biden administration rule that put a moratorium on housing evictions, and they stalled his student loan forgiveness plan, which was justified as a response to the pandemic.

But only Gorsuch voted to end the reliance on a pandemic-based policy at the border.

Title 42 is a provision in the public health law that dates to 1893 and the effort to prevent the spread of cholera. As amended in 1944, the law authorized the surgeon general to prohibit...the introduction of persons or property” from countries where contagious diseases are rampant.

President Trump declared COVID-19 to be a national emergency, and the White House ordered the Centers for Disease Control to authorize barring entry by “non-citizens” who arrived at the border without visas or other proper documents.

That rule has remained in effect, even as the pandemic has waned and President Biden replaced Trump.

Last month, however, a federal judge in Washington set aside the rule and held the COVID-19 pandemic could no longer justify preventing migrants from claiming asylum. Judge Emmet Sullivan agreed to a five-week delay before his ruling took effect. He set Dec. 21 as the deadline.

The U.S. appeals court in a 3-0 decision refused to lift the deadline.

In response to the appeal from Arizona and the 18 other GOP states, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued an “administrative stay” on Dec. 20 to put the matter on hold for a few days so the full court could decide.

The case was Arizona vs. Mayorkas.",Immigration
latimes,Immigration,9392,latimes,"President Biden’s lawyers urged the Supreme Court on Tuesday to reject an emergency appeal from Republican-led states and end the Trump-era COVID-19 policy that turned away migrants at the border who were seeking asylum.

But Solicitor Gen. Elizabeth B. Prelogar also asked the high court to keep in place the so-called Title 42 border restrictions for another week to give the administration time to prepare for more intensive screening of migrants at the border.

The border restrictions were set to expire on Wednesday, but Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. paused that deadline indefinitely on Monday.

The Title 42 policy, based on a long-standing public health emergency law, was imposed by the Trump administration during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent infected persons from entering the country.

A federal judge said the policy can no longer be justified since the health crisis is easing. When he ordered the restrictions be lifted by Dec. 21, the Republican states sued to keep them in place.

In a filing Tuesday with the Supreme Court, Biden attorneys agreed that the time had come to end the COVID-related rules.

“The government recognizes that the end of the Title 42 orders will likely lead to disruption and a temporary increase in unlawful border crossings,” Prelogar said. “The government in no way seeks to minimize the seriousness of that problem. But the solution to that immigration problem cannot be to extend indefinitely a public-health measure that all now acknowledge has outlived its public-health justification.”

The Trump administration policy authorized agents to expel migrants without giving them an asylum hearing.

In its place, the Biden administration says it will be do speedy hearings to determine which migrants can seek asylum based on a credible fear of persecution.

The justices have yet to decide whether to grant the appeal from Arizona and 18 other GOP-led states, and perhaps hear arguments on whether the Trump policy can be ended.

Until now, the court’s conservatives have been skeptical of the Biden administration’s reliance on the pandemic to enforce its rules.

In a 6-3 decision, the court revoked a moratorium on housing evictions that Biden had maintained as a pandemic measure. By the same vote, the conservative majority blocked a Labor Department rule that would have required large employers to enforce a vaccine mandate.

Earlier this month, the court put on hold Biden’s plan to wipe out millions of student loans, which was based on his emergency authority to cope with the pandemic. The justices will hear arguments in February on the legality of the proposed loan forgiveness.

But in the immigration dispute, the tables are turned. It is the conservative states that argue the pandemic-related health measure known as Title 42 must remain in force. The Democratic administration disagrees.

Earlier this year, two federal judges handed down conflicting rulings on Title 42, and both decisions were based on the Administrative Procedure Act, not federal immigration law.

In May, Judge Robert Summerhays, a Trump appointee in Louisiana, ruled for more than 20 Republican-led states and said the Biden administration may not repeal its use of Title 42. Doing so, he said, would be “arbitrary and capricious” and violate the APA because the administration did not seek formal comments in advance.

In November, Judge Emmet G. Sullivan, a Clinton appointee in Washington, ruled for the ACLU and immigrants’ rights advocates and said it was “arbitrary and capricious” under the APA for the administration to still rely on Title 42 long after the COVID emergency has faded. Now the harm to immigrants seeking asylum outweighs any health benefit, he said.

Sullivan agreed to have his decision take effect in five weeks, making Dec. 21 the deadline.",Immigration
latimes,Police,9319,latimes,"With efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal languishing, the Biden administration on Wednesday hit Tehran with a new batch of economic sanctions as punishment for repression of widespread demonstrations against restrictions on women and other issues.

Iranian security forces have cracked down on thousands of citizens protesting the death in police custody last month of Mahsa Amini, a young Iranian Kurdish woman who was arrested for supposedly wearing her hijab incorrectly. The protests have broadened to air additional grievances over political and civil rights, forming one of the largest protest movements in the Islamic Republic in years.

Scores of protesters have been reported killed.

The Biden administration blacklisted 14 Iranian officials, including intelligence officials, prison wardens and a governor, and three entities or companies, including a network of hackers it accused of interfering with protesters’ ability to communicate, organize and gain access to social media.

The sanctions aim to hold accountable Iranian officials responsible for the brutal crackdown on protesters, abuse inside Iran’s notorious prisons, censorship and “malicious cyberactivity against the Iranian people,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said.

The U.S. “will continue to impose costs on individuals and entities in Iran who engage in the brutal repression of the Iranian people,” Blinken added.

The measures prohibit those targeted from doing business with people, firms and many banking institutions in the U.S. and usually from traveling to this country. They are among scores of sanctions already in place that have helped cripple the Iranian economy but done little to stop what the U.S. refers to as Tehran’s malicious activities, including support for armed militants in the region.

In recent days, U.S. officials added to the list of misdeeds the accusation that Iran is supplying Russia with armed drones being used to attack civilians and critical infrastructure in Ukraine. The U.S. also says it has intelligence that Iranian military personnel are training Russians, within Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, on how to use the drones.

Moscow and Tehran have denied the claim, contradicting photographs the Ukrainian military has supplied of downed drones.

“There is clear, unmistakable evidence of Iran’s support to various malign actors, from the Houthis [in Yemen] to Russia to others in conflict zones around the world, of UAV [drone] technology,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said, citing a recent closed-door session of the United Nations Security Council. UAV stands for “unmanned aerial vehicle.”

Israel also said it was providing the U.S. with evidence of Iran’s drones attacking Ukraine. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, in Washington to meet with President Biden on Wednesday, said intelligence had identified some of the downed drones as those displayed publicly by Iran in recent years.

Iran “is a threat to regional and global stability,” Herzog told reporters ahead of the meeting at the White House.

Israel is also the world’s most vocal opponent to the Iran nuclear deal, a landmark international accord signed in 2015 that limited Tehran’s ability to produce nuclear material. Then President Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018, saying it wasn’t tough enough, and it all but collapsed.

Iran resumed its enrichment of uranium, raising fears it could get closer to having the ability to build a bomb.

The Biden administration embarked on arduous indirect negotiations with European signatories to the deal, serving as mediator with Iran in hopes of reviving it. But the talks, held in Vienna, bogged down at an apparent impasse, and it is unclear what the future of the accord is.

These latest developments — the crackdown on protesters and Russia’s reported use of Iranian drones in Ukraine — only further complicate reaching a deal, over which there is strong opposition in some parts of the U.S. Congress.

Amini was arrested on Sept. 13 by Iran’s so-called morality police for supposedly failing to wear her head cover tightly enough. She died in police custody three days later. The police said the 22-year-old collapsed and died of natural causes. Her family says she had been beaten.

“Forty days after the tragic death of Mahsa Amini, Iranians continue to bravely protest in the face of brutal suppression and disruption of internet access,” Brian Nelson, undersecretary of the Treasury for financial intelligence, said in a statement.

The new sanctions “on Iranian officials overseeing organizations involved in violent crackdowns and killings, including of children, [are] part of our commitment to hold all levels of the Iranian government accountable for its repression,” he said.

The 40-day mark after a death receives special observance in several religions, including Shiite Islam, and supporters of Amini filled the streets of her Kurdish hometown and flocked to her gravesite, while demonstrations erupted again in Tehran and other cities.

Separately, the U.S. also imposed yet another round of sanctions on Russia, this time for its alleged interference in elections in nearby Moldova and efforts to control most branches of the former Soviet republic’s government and “subvert Moldovan democracy.” The sanctions named several oligarchs who form an important part of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s power base.",Police
latimes,Police,9280,latimes,"As street protests in Iran turned increasingly deadly, President Ebrahim Raisi on Wednesday accused the West of maintaining a double standard on human rights.

Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Raisi attempted to deflect international outrage over the death last week of a 22-year-old woman in the custody of Iran’s so-called morality police. They reportedly arrested her for failing to completely cover her hair.

Raisi also used the speech to insist that Iran was eager to revive the moribund nuclear deal aimed at preventing the country from developing a bomb, but questioned whether the U.S. could be a trusted partner in any accord.

It was a rare appearance in the West by Raisi, a hard-liner who became Iran’s president about a year ago.

“Human rights belongs to all, but unfortunately it is trampled upon by many governments,” Raisi said. He cited the suffering of stateless Palestinians and the detention of migrant children in the U.S., separating them from their families.

The Iranian government has maintained that Mahsa Amini, an Iranian Kurd, died of a heart attack after she was detained and sent to a “reeducation center” for instruction on proper attire. Iran forces all women to wear headscarves that cover their hair as well as other clothing considered to be modest.

Amini’s family insists she was healthy and had no heart condition. The government has ordered an investigation.

Her death touched off protests in numerous Iranian cities, some involving women torching their scarves. On Wednesday, seven people were reported killed in the demonstrations as security forces moved to crack down on the protesters.

“Iran’s security forces will continue to feel emboldened to kill or injure protesters and prisoners, including women arrested for defying abusive compulsory veiling laws, if they are not held accountable,” Diana Eltahawy, Middle East deputy director for Amnesty International, said in a statement. She also demanded an independent investigation and criticized Raisi being given a world stage amid what she called Iran’s abuses.

In other comments, Raisi said his government had a “great and serious will” to return to the 2015 nuclear deal, a landmark international accord brokered by the Obama administration and six other countries. It substantially reduced Iran’s atomic energy program and was designed to prevent the country from developing a bomb.

But President Trump walked out of the deal in 2018, saying it didn’t go far enough in restricting Iran. Tehran resumed enrichment of uranium, a key component in nuclear weapons. With the election of Joe Biden, the U.S. entered indirect negotiations with Iran through European signatories to the deal in an effort to revive it.

Those talks have been repeatedly stalled by demands from both sides. Iran seeks relief from economic sanctions that the U.S. imposed and that have crippled its economy.

“We have before us the experience of America’s withdrawal” from the deal, Raisi said. “With that experience and this perspective, can we ignore the important issue of guarantees for a durable agreement?”

“We only wish one thing: observance of commitments,” Raisi said.

Biden, who also addressed the General Assembly on Wednesday, said the U.S. also wanted to reenter the deal. But he said Iran had to meet its obligations, which include allowing the U.N. watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct extensive inspections of Iran’s nuclear facilities. While also part of the 2015 deal, Tehran has recently attempted to keep inspectors away from some of its installations.

“The United States is clear: We will not allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon,” said Biden, who also offered support for the demonstrators in Iran who he said are seeking “to secure their basic rights.”",Police
latimes,Police,9388,latimes,"In an unprecedented step in American history, the House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol unanimously recommended Monday that former President Trump be criminally prosecuted for insurrection, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, knowingly and willfully making materially false statements to the federal government and conspiracy to defraud the United States.

The referrals for Trump and others in his orbit are nonbinding recommendations and cannot compel the Justice Department to act. But they show the committee believes it has gathered sufficient evidence to prove Trump provided “aid and comfort” to a mob that ransacked the Capitol and actively tried to prevent the peaceful transition of power to a new president selected by voters, Joe Biden.

“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one,” said Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the panel’s vice chair. “January 6, 2021, was the first time one American president refused his constitutional duty to transfer power peacefully to the next. In our work over the last 18 months, the select committee has recognized our obligation to do everything we can to ensure this never happens again.”

The committee laid out its rationale and evidence for the referrals in an introductory document released after the hearing. The document hinted that more information will be available when the full report is released later this week.

“This committee will lay out a number of recommendations in this final report,” Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said. “But beyond any specific details and recommendations we present, there’s one factor I believe is most important in preventing another Jan. 6 — accountability ... accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system.”

The committee’s 18-month investigation and nine public hearings this year placed Trump at the center of the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and to assemble a mob he directed to Capitol Hill to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power.

“Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,” committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said while announcing the referrals. “The evidence clearly suggests that President Trump conspired with others to submit slates of fake electors to Congress and the National Archives.”

Raskin said after the hearing that other referrals will be made this week.

The White House declined to say whether it supports the committee’s criminal referrals or the Justice Department pursuing charges against Trump.

The committee also referred California attorney John Eastman for criminal charges, including obstruction. The panel has argued in court that Eastman, the architect of the legal theory that the vice president could reject certain states’ electors, a strategy Trump attempted to use, most likely violated two federal laws: obstructing an official act of Congress and defrauding the American public. U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who is based in Santa Ana, concluded that Trump and Eastman likely conspired to overturn the election, an act which the judge described as “a coup in search of a legal theory.”

In a statement, Eastman responded that the public would have been better served if the committee had focused on Capitol security and elections reform.

“A criminal ‘referral’ from a congressional committee is not binding on the Department of Justice and carries no more legal weight than a ‘referral’ from any American citizen,” Eastman said. “In fact, a ‘referral’ from the January 6th committee should carry a great deal less weight due to the absurdly partisan nature of the process that produced it.”

Raskin said in the hearing that the committee was referring Trump, Eastman and “others” for certain charges, but did not name the other people. In the report’s introduction, which was released after the hearing, the committee identified others who they believe the Justice Department could potentially prosecute, but refrained from urging that they be charged.

“Our criminal referrals were based on the gravity of the offense, the centrality of the actors and the evidence that we had available to us, and there were undoubtedly other people involved, but we were stymied by virtue of a lot of people refusing to come and testify, refusing to give us info they had or taking the 5th Amendment,” Raskin told reporters after the hearing. “We chose to advance the names of people where we felt certain that there was abundant evidence that they had participated in crimes.”

Republican lawmakers who didn’t comply with committee subpoenas were also referred to the House Ethics Committee: Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) and Republican Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Jim Jordan of Ohio and Andy Biggs of Arizona.

It is unlikely that panel would take up the referrals with just weeks left before Republicans take control of the House.

Though the committee referrals do not carry legal weight or compel any action by special counsel Jack Smith, who is conducting his own wide-ranging investigation, they signal that the congressional committee believes it has evidence that crimes were committed.

Four committee members who are also attorneys — Reps. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), Cheney and Raskin — were tasked with determining who to refer for potential prosecution by the Justice Department or punishment by other entities.

The committee members briefly summarized their findings during Monday’s hearing, providing a preview of the panel’s final report, which is expected to be released in full Wednesday.

Thompson said the committee will make public the bulk of the non-sensitive material it has compiled before the end of the year, though it is not clear exactly what the scope of that material will be.",Police
latimes,Police,9241,latimes,"A key Senate Republican said it will be at least another month before he finishes an investigation into whether Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was aware at the time of a top aide’s alleged sexual harassment of others in the mayor’s office, likely further delaying any Senate action on Garcetti’s nomination to be ambassador to India.

Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said he would continue the work at least through the Senate’s next recess, which is due to end April 25.

“I don’t have a definite date when we’re going to get done, but I know it won’t be until after we get back after the recess,” Grassley said in a brief interview in the Capitol.

Grassley’s inquiry is the latest delay in Garcetti’s nomination process, raising new questions on Capitol Hill about when or whether he will be confirmed. Grassley put a hold on Garcetti’s nomination earlier this month, saying information he’s received from a whistleblower needs to be investigated.

President Biden nominated Garcetti to the post eight months ago.

Garcetti has said under oath and before Congress that he didn’t know about the allegations against his aide, Rick Jacobs, and if he had, he would have done something about it. Jacobs has denied the allegations.

A Democratic senator on Tuesday said she, too, would like more information on Garcetti’s denial.

“I understand that he testified he didn’t know anything about it. I’d just like to get further corroboration on that situation,” said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), who since 2018 has been asking every judicial nominee about whether they have ever been accused of sexual assault or harassment. “I’m still gathering information. I’m not prepared to tell you one way or the other today,” she said when discussing whether she has any concerns about the nomination.

Grassley declined to characterize any conclusions his investigation might draw. He said last week he would extend the probe after hearing from additional whistleblowers and obtaining the final copy of a report summarizing a city-funded investigation.

The report, which probed a Los Angeles police officer’s allegations against Jacobs, cleared the mayor, but critics say it also left out information that would have bolstered the officer’s claims.

Grassley said he must expand the investigation because the city report had an “extremely narrow scope,” and did not cover allegations that Jacobs sexually harassed Garcetti’s senior staff and made racist comments to staff in front of Garcetti.

Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned how much time Grassley was taking on the report.

“This nominee has been hanging out there a long time,” Menendez said. “All of a sudden, we have an investigation. You know, I wonder whether it is because there’s something to actually be pursued? Or is it just, you know, the process of delay.”

He insisted his committee did a “thorough vetting” of Garcetti, as it does for every nominee. “Now, if somebody comes forth after we do our vetting and says something, we certainly will consider it if it’s brought to our attention,” he said.

Some of the Senate’s strongest advocates against sexual harassment have been silent on the issue.

“You should talk to Foreign Relations about it,” said Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who helped lead the 2018 fight to reform how sexual harassment claims against lawmakers are handled in Congress.

“I will look into it and I’ll let you know,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who has fought against sexual misconduct in the military, when asked if she was familiar with the nomination.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who questioned Garcetti on the topic during his December confirmation hearing, said she was “satisfied” with his statement that he didn’t know about Jacobs’ behavior.

At the hearing, Garcetti said, “I want to say unequivocally that I never witnessed, nor was it brought to my attention, the behavior that’s been alleged, and I also want to assure you if it had been, I would have immediately taken action to stop that.”

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is among the Republicans most likely to support a Democratic nominee, said she “absolutely” planned to look into the allegations before any potential floor vote.

“I have read press accounts that there’re issues involving some allegations of sexual abuse, but I didn’t know anything beyond that,” she said.

Naomi Seligman, a former Garcetti spokesperson, filed a complaint with the Justice Department last month demanding that Garcetti be prosecuted for perjury for denying that he knew about Jacobs’ alleged misconduct. She has been in touch with 20 senators’ offices to speak out against his confirmation.

“We are encouraged by our meetings on both sides of the aisle,” she said. “It is heartening to see so many Senate offices treat this issue with the seriousness it deserves.”

Democrats control the Senate, 50-50, with the tiebreaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. If Garcetti can retain the support of all 50 Democrats, he can win confirmation without any Republican votes.

latimes,Police,9321,latimes,"Elections have consequences, as the saying goes. So too does the rhetoric surrounding elections.

To say our politics have coarsened over the last few decades is like noting that temperatures drop and daylight shortens as we settle into autumn.

It’s so obvious, it seems the natural order of things.

But it’s a choice we’ve made and grown to accept, and even embrace. The most strident among us are lavished with attention — book contracts, TV ratings, millions of followers on social media. Those who provoke and outrage win office and legions of devotees.

As our politics have grown less ideological — a belief in bigger vs. smaller government, support for higher or lower taxes — and more theological, the difference between Democrat and Republican has increasingly been cast in terms of good vs. evil.

Taken to its illogical extreme, the result is violence, like the attack early Friday on Paul Pelosi by an assailant who invaded his San Francisco home in apparent hopes of assassinating his wife, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

She was in Washington, with her protective detail, at the time of the break-in. Paul Pelosi, 82, who was bludgeoned with a hammer, was hospitalized and underwent surgery Friday for a skull fracture and injuries to his right arm and hands. Doctors expect a full recovery.

Political violence is, of course, nothing new.

This country was founded in a revolution, fought a Civil War to end the bondage of its Black citizens and has witnessed countless individuals killed for espousing contrary or unpopular beliefs.

Those events are part of history. What assaults us today are seemingly endless accounts, one after another, of lawlessness and political vigilantism.

Death threats. A plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor. Self-appointed watchdogs swarming polls and menacing voters. Insurrectionists sentenced for invading the Capitol at the behest of a power-mad president.

Much of the blame rests on Republican shoulders, as many of the faithful have embraced outlandish and frankly nutty QAnon theories that paint Democrats as a party of devil-worshiping pedophiles.

But the animosity — if not outrageous caricature — runs both ways. Repeated polls have found Democrats questioning the goodwill and patriotism, not to mention judgment, of Republicans.

It’s no longer just the fringe acting out.

“What’s new is we have violent sentiments in the mainstream of America,” said Robert Pape, a University of Chicago expert on political extremism.

A September survey he helped conduct found 5% of American adults believed the use of force was justified in restoring Donald Trump to the presidency. That may seem like a small number, but it represents 13 million people.

As Pape noted, “Thirteen million is way too big a number to think of as the fringe.”

Politics, which is too often disparaged, is how we settle our differences without taking up arms. Or, at least, it’s supposed to be. When the disagreement between parties, party loyalists and the other side grow shrouded in fear and conspiracy theories, it should not be surprising when someone unhinged lashes out.

“I want to be clear,” Rep. Adam Kinzinger tweeted after news of the attack on Pelosi. “When you convince people that politicians are rigging elections, drink babies blood, etc., you will get violence.”

Tellingly, the Illinois Republican was speaking from the political wilderness; Kinzinger was effectively excommunicated from his party for voting to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 riot and agreeing to serve on the House committee investigating the attempted coup.

Hours before the assault on Paul Pelosi, billionaire Elon Musk assumed ownership of Twitter. It was a coincidence of timing and geography. (Twitter headquarters is less than three miles from the Pelosi residence.) But it doesn’t bode well.

The social media site has been a slough of hate speech, disinformation and ad hominem attack, contributing in a major way to the polluting of our politics. Musk has promised to unleash even more vitriol and hostility by raising the gates and lifting the barriers to Twitter’s already foul content.

Pelosi’s alleged assailant, David DePape, 42, was apparently well-marinated in a stew of crazy right-wing theories about “the elites/ruling class.”

Since the 1978 Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke case, the court has held that colleges and universities may consider race as a “plus factor” for Black and Latino applicants to create a more diverse class.

But the court’s conservatives have long opposed this affirmative action, and they contend the law prohibits consideration of an applicant’s race.

Students for Fair Admission vs. Harvard and SFFA vs. UNC will be argued Oct. 31.

Does the Voting Rights Act call for fair and equal representation for Blacks and Latinos, sometimes requiring states to draw election districts likely to elect a Black or Latino candidate?

Lawyers for Alabama call this a form of “racial segregation” and urge the court to adopt a “race neutral” rule that frees states from this duty of fair representation for racial minorities.

About 27% of Alabama residents are Black, but only one of seven congressional districts had a Black majority under the state’s map.

Merrill vs. Milligan will be argued Oct. 4.

Does a state legislature have an “independent” and exclusive power to set the rules for federal elections, or can the state supreme court or the governor play a role as well?

This case arose when North Carolina’s Republican legislators drew a highly partisan election map that would ensure 10 of 14 congressional seats would be held by the GOP.

But the state Supreme Court ruled the map was unfair and violated the state constitution, and the judges drew a new map. Now Republican legislators are urging justices to rule the map-making power is theirs alone.

Election law experts fear such a ruling could embolden partisan lawmakers to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.

Moore vs. Harper will be heard in December.

Does a Colorado website designer who is a conservative Christian have a free-speech right to refuse to work on wedding plans for a same-sex couple, or does this discrimination violate the state’s civil rights law?

Four years ago, the justices wrestled with this question in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case involving a baker of wedding cakes but failed to decide the free-speech question.

A ruling for the Colorado plaintiff could affect California and 20 other states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Can wetlands usually be protected from development under the Clean Water Act or only if they are part of a permanent and flowing body of water?

Federal law says the Environmental Protection Agency may protect the “waters of the United States” from pollutants, but it is not clear whether the agency’s authority extends to seasonal streams or soggy land that is not directly connected to a lake, river or bay.

Can California voters require that pork meat sold in the state come from farms where animals are not “abused” and where breeding pigs are given enough room to stand and turn around?

Midwest farmers say 99% of the pork sold in California comes from outside the state, and they say the state’s rules would force them to make costly changes in their operation.

Can the Biden administration enforce guidelines that call for arresting and deporting only immigrants who pose a current danger to public safety, or does the law require arresting and removing anyone with a criminal record or final order of removal?

The administration argued immigration officials have always had broad discretion in enforcing the law, but a judge in Texas blocked the use of the new guidelines.

Referencing the recent FBI search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida residence of former President Trump, Garcia accused the Biden administration and what he called the “deep state” of “weaponizing federal agencies” for political purposes.

“This is literally tyranny of a majority right now that is acting more like a Third Reich than they are the United States. And this is very dangerous,” Garcia told Sara Carter, a right-leaning media personality, on her eponymous podcast.

Trump’s most stalwart backers increasingly use incendiary language, including references to Nazi Germany, to defend the former president. But unlike those safely ensconced in a deep red district, Garcia is locked in a hotly contested reelection battle for his northern Los Angeles County district that will hinge on his ability to win over independents and Democrats, not just the GOP base.

After last year’s redistricting process, Democrats have a 12-point registration advantage in the 27th Congressional District, which includes the cities of Palmdale, Lancaster and Santa Clarita. The redrawn lines made Garcia one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in the nation and a top target for Democrats, who see the seat as a rare pick-up opportunity.

Garcia is squaring off against Christy Smith, a Democrat and former state assemblywoman who lost to Garcia in a 2020 special election and came up just 333 votes short in a rematch in November that year. Political prognosticators consider the race a toss-up.

When asked about Garcia’s remarks, a campaign spokesman sent a statement: “Mike Garcia has spent a career fighting against tyranny and oppression serving in the military, and no one in Congress values our strategic partnership with Israel more or fights for our Jewish community harder than he does.”

Smith, in an interview with The Times, denounced Garcia’s comments as a “horrific trivialization of the Holocaust” and “a very deliberate attack on the credibility of our governing and law enforcement institutions.”

Facing a more Democratic-leaning electorate, Garcia has tried to pull off a political balancing act. He voted against certifying the results of the 2020 election and against impeaching Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. But he has emphasized work that has more cross-party appeal, including support for military families and efforts to combat illegal marijuana grows in Antelope Valley.

In a speech earlier this month at the Reagan Library, he called for redefining “America First” as being more engaged globally, breaking from Trump’s isolationist streak. And he called for more bipartisan cooperation, denouncing politicians and activists on both sides of the political spectrum of “retreat[ing] to their caveman tendencies.”

Garcia made similar points in his podcast interview with Carter, lamenting an “us-versus-them mentality.”

“It’s easy to divide,” Garcia said. “There’s million ways we can divide — small groups, large groups. The hard work comes in unifying.”

Carter then raised concerns that federal bureaucracies could target political enemies, referencing “FBI raids” in an allusion to the Aug. 8 search of Trump’s estate. Garcia said her questions were valid.

“They’re not doing this to try to get a reckoning or to bring justice and have someone held accountable. They do it for political purposes,” Garcia said. “This is why you see the the charges levied, the raids made and in some cases, no charges even brought forward. But then never substantiated, ever followed through and then never actually prosecuted.”

The Justice Department investigation into Trump continues; a warrant that was unsealed at the request of Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland showed that the former president is under investigation for potential violations of the Espionage Act, which bars the unauthorized retention of material related to national defense, as well as obstruction of justice laws. During the search, agents removed 11 sets of classified documents — including some marked top secret that were not supposed to be taken outside government facilities.

Smith said Garcia’s remarks added to the divisiveness he often bemoans.

“This points to a consistent pattern with Rep. Garcia where he publicly issues one set of performative statements,” she said, “but when he thinks it’s private and in front of a confined, more extreme audience, he has a different story to tell.”

Garcia’s comparison to the Third Reich echoes comments by Trump’s hardline supporters. Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert compared the FBI to the Gestapo, Adolf Hitler’s secret police. Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, meanwhile, equated the law enforcement agency to Hitler’s paramilitary organization, calling for “the dismantling and elimination of democrat brown shirts known as the FBI.”

Other GOP politicians denounced the actions by the Department of Justice as those of a banana republic or other oppressive regime.

Such rhetoric has been denounced by other Republicans, such as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who said Scott’s Gestapo analogy was “very concerning to me. It’s outrageous rhetoric.” He described the heated criticism of federal law enforcement as “dangerous,” pointing to an incident where, days after the Mar-a-Lago search, a man tried to breach an FBI office in Cincinnati before dying in a confrontation with police.",Police
latimes,Police,9242,latimes,"Fox news made its way to Capitol Hill on Tuesday.

Rep. Ami Bera (D-Elk Grove) identified himself as the victim of a fox attack. Bera, a doctor, told reporters he was walking near a Senate office building Monday when he felt something around his ankle.

“Yeah, I was just walking, as I often would, over by that park over by Russell [Senate Office Building] and felt something lunge — totally unprovoked, right — at the back of my leg,” Bera said, adding that he was thankful he had an umbrella with him to help fend off the wild animal. “It felt like a small dog.”

The disclosure of a fox attack on a member of Congress followed a memo that went out Tuesday warning of possible fox dens on Capitol grounds.

The Office of the Sergeant at Arms sent an alert notifying members of Congress and staff that U.S. Capitol Police had received reports Monday of people being attacked or bitten by a fox.

The notice, which was also forwarded to journalists who cover Congress, described the locations of two encounters and said Capitol Police had received a call Tuesday morning about a fox approaching staff near an intersection.

“There are possibly several fox dens on Capitol grounds,” the notification said. “Animal Control is currently on the grounds seeking to trap and relocate any foxes they find. Foxes are wild animals that are very protective of their dens and territory. Please do not approach any fox you see.”

Bera said the bite didn’t appear to puncture through his sock and into his skin. He said he will take a seven-shot anti-rabies regimen as a precaution and advised everyone on Capitol grounds to take encounters with wild animals seriously.

He tweeted that he is “healthy and back at work serving the people of #CA07.”

A Politico reporter said she was also bitten by a fox as she was leaving the Capitol on Tuesday, because “that’s of course something I expect in THE MIDDLE OF DC.”

Shortly after, Capitol Police broke some news of its own: It captured a fox.

A parody Twitter account was created as the identity of the Capitol fox. It released a statement on its “illegal arrest.”

“As a fox, I cannot speak. And too often — I have nobody to speak for me,” the statement began.

“Today, I was forcibly removed from my den by very scary and mean individuals,” it continued. “I am innocent of the crimes in question. This will not be the end.”",Police
latimes,Police,9337,latimes,"After an extraordinary race marked by vitriolic social media feuding, Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated his Republican opponent, celebrity television physician Dr. Mehmet Oz, in Pennsylvania’s Senate contest five months after suffering a debilitating stroke.

Addressing a packed room of cheering supporters at his election party in Pittsburgh, Fetterman rubbed his eyes and said he did not really know what to say.

“Every county, every vote,” he said, repeating his campaign slogan. “We jammed them up. We held the line. I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue.”

The contest received more buzz and advertising money than any Senate race in the nation. The Associated Press called the race, though official results will take longer. Fetterman held a firm lead by 1:30 a.m. Eastern, with 49.9% of the votes compared with 47.7% for Oz

The national political stakes were high. After Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey’s decision to retire, Democrats were eager to pick up a seat in the key swing state that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020. Meanwhile, Republicans aimed to keep the seat as part of their plan to seize control of the Senate.

As personalities, Oz and Fetterman upped the ante, embracing an aggressive back and forth of viral snark and aggressive social media trolling. A Trump supporter and longtime television personality who until recently lived in New Jersey, Oz cast himself as a moderate Republican looking to control inflation and rein in crime. Fetterman, the plain-spoken former mayor of Braddock, ran as an anti-establishment figure in tune with blue-collar voters on economic issues.

In April, Fetterman pummeled Oz for his performance in a 35-second video that showed him pulling broccoli, asparagus, carrots and guacamole off a grocery store shelf and blaming Biden for the cost of “crudité.”

“In PA, we call this a Veggie Tray,” Fetterman snarked in his own video, appealing to supporters to donate to his campaign and help send Oz packing.

Fetterman received a significant setback in May when, just days before the state’s primary, he suffered a stroke.

The Democratic candidate was forced to cancel campaign events. Still, in the middle of August, Fetterman held a commanding lead of 12 percentage points over Oz in the FiveThirtyEight average of polls. But by election day that advantage had eroded, with polls showing the race a toss-up with Fetterman leading by just 0.1 point.

Oz released a barrage of campaign ads on crime to chip away at Fetterman’s lead. In late October, when the two candidates met for their one and only debate, Fetterman delivered an uneven performance, stumbling over his words and struggling to articulate points on abortion rights and fracking.

In the final stretch of the campaign, Fetterman talked readily about his health struggles and his ongoing recovery. At a rally in Pittsburgh on Saturday, Fetterman acknowledged his recent speech challenges, joking about stepping onto the stage before former President Obama.

“Here’s a pro tip,” he told the crowd. “Please, if you are gonna give a speech after you’ve been recovered from a stroke, you really don’t want to have to come before Barack Obama.”

Obama was just one of a flurry of national political heavyweights, including President Biden and Trump, who touched down in Pennsylvania over the weekend.

Obama castigated Oz for his dubious medical claims as a TV doctor — “If somebody’s willing to peddle snake oil to make a buck, then he’s probably willing to sell snake oil to get elected” — and also hit back against Republicans on the economy, stating that the GOP liked to talk about inflation but had no solutions.

“What’s their answer?” he said. “What’s their economic policy?”

Stumping for Oz in the small town of Latrobe, about 35 miles east of Pittsburgh, Trump stuck to general talking points.

“If you support the decline and fall of America, then you must vote for the radical left Democrats,” Trump told the crowd. “If you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then this Tuesday, you must vote Republican.”",Police
latimes,Police,9297,latimes,"Five leaders of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing militia that played a leading role in storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, went on trial last week in Washington.

The defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the Yale-educated lawyer who founded the group, were charged with “seditious conspiracy”: plotting to attack the federal government by force to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election.

Prosecutors said Rhodes and others planned the assault on the Capitol, ordered their troops to bring “zombie killer tomahawks” and other weapons and stockpiled guns in hotels in case the battle escalated.

“We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” Rhodes told his followers in a text message, according to his indictment.

The trial, the first of several planned for ringleaders of the insurrection, has high stakes.

It’s the highest-profile prosecution so far in the Justice Department’s massive Jan. 6 dragnet.

It’s a rare use of “seditious conspiracy,” the U.S. equivalent of a domestic terrorism law, a charge that dates back to the Civil War. The defendants aren’t accused of committing violent acts but of organizing the squad that did.

And it may have crippled the Oath Keepers, a 13-year-old militia recruited largely from military veterans and law enforcement officers that styled itself as the armed vanguard of the militant right.

“As an organization, the Oath Keepers have lost a lot of steam from this,” said Jon Lewis, a terrorism scholar at George Washington University. “Members have distanced themselves from the leadership. Their brand has become toxic.”

But the prosecutions haven’t put a perceptible dent in the larger phenomenon of right-wing extremism, an ecosystem that includes white supremacists, antigovernment militants and many (but far from all) supporters of former President Trump.

For example, the Proud Boys, another militia whose leader, Enrique Tarrio, and four lieutenants are scheduled to go on trial on similar charges in December. The Proud Boys aren’t shrinking; they appear to be expanding.

“Their leadership has been decimated, but we’ve seen increased activity at a local level,” Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League told me. “They keep adding new chapters ... and their agenda has diversified; they’re showing up at school board meetings and campaigning on LGBTQ issues.”

The militant right has survived Jan. 6 in other forms too.

“It’s a mistake to focus on the militias,” said Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, who has studied the Jan. 6 rioters.

“Almost 90% of the Jan. 6 defendants were not militia members,” he said. “What made Jan. 6 happen was not Oath Keepers or Proud Boys. It was a larger movement that includes many mainstream Trump supporters too. ... The militias are only the most visible part.”

Based on public opinion surveys, about 18 million Americans believe violence is justified to restore Trump to the White House, Pape estimates. Other polls have suggested even larger numbers.

Terrorism scholars say the extremist right is surviving not on the strength of its organizations but on a powerful narrative that appeals to millions of discontented conservatives.

A key part of that narrative is the conviction, fed by Trump and his allies, that Democrats stole the 2020 election and will continue using illegitimate means to prevent conservatives from winning.

Now add one more phenomenon, something scholars call “stochastic terrorism”: seemingly random, lone-wolf attacks inspired by the statements of leaders like Trump.

“We have people with massive megaphones saying we need to do something to stop a corrupt FBI, or an Internal Revenue Service that’s about to send 87,000 armed agents into your homes,” said Lewis, referring to the plan to hire 87,000 IRS employees, most of whom will not be enforcement agents.

“Some people’s response to those messages is not ‘I should go vote.’ It’s ‘I should pick up my gun and head for the nearest federal building.’”

If Republican leaders, including Trump, don’t intend that to be the effect of their words, there’s a simple remedy: They could denounce violence in all its forms — including the violence of Trump supporters on Jan. 6.

Too often, they don’t.

Their political winking at violence makes a difficult task — fighting domestic terrorism while respecting civil liberties — even harder.

“It’s impossible for law enforcement to chase down every right-wing extremist who posts messages on the internet and also owns a firearm,” said Lewis.

All of which means this wave of violent extremism on the right is far from over.

Before the 2020 presidential election, Trump was asked what his message was for the Proud Boys, who even then were issuing threats of violence.

His answer was indulgent. “Stand back and stand by,” he said.

latimes,Police,9374,latimes,"The Supreme Court sounded divided Tuesday over a clash between President Biden and the state of Texas involving immigration enforcement.

At issue is whether an existing law requires federal authorities to arrest, detain and deport any “criminal alien” they encounter, or instead gives them the discretion to focus on those who pose the greatest threat to public safety.

The case is a major test of executive power. In the past, justices frequently gave presidents latitude in matters of immigration enforcement.

But the court’s current conservative majority has increasingly expressed skepticism about Biden administration policies.

It is also unclear whether the case will have much day-to-day impact on immigration enforcement.

Near the end of Tuesday’s argument, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh noted that both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they did not have the money or resources to arrest or detain all immigrants in the country illegally who have been charged with a felony.

That is not likely to change, he told a Texas state attorney, even if his side wins the case.

The case began when Texas Atty. Gen. Ken Paxton sued to challenge a change in policy when President Biden took office.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas backed off the hard-line approach of the Trump administration and issued enforcement guidelines that called for focusing on detaining and deporting immigrants who were a danger to public safety.

The Texas lawsuit argued the law required the government to take enforcement action against tens of thousands of immigrants in the country illegally and with criminal records.

He pointed to a provision adopted by Congress in 1996 that said federal authorities “shall take into custody any alien” with an “aggravated felony” in their past.

A second provision says the government “shall detain” an immigrant who had been ordered to be “removed” or deported.

Paxton took his suit to the courthouse of U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton in Corpus Christi, a Trump appointee. Tipton handed down a broad ruling that held the Mayorkas memo was illegal and may not be followed.

U.S. Solicitor Gen. Elizabeth B. Prelogar, defending the administration, told the court the judge’s ruling was wrong for several reasons.

She urged justices to rein in the growing practice of states suing to overturn or block presidential orders and policies they oppose.

During the Trump administration, California and other Democratic-led states sued regularly to block conservative policies. Now it is Republican states suing to challenge the Biden administration.

She also said a single federal district judge should not be permitted to hand down a broad ruling that prevents the administration throughout the nation from relying on a guidance memo.

Finally, Prelogar said the law should not be read to require the government to spend enormous amounts of time and money seeking to track down and detain hundreds of thousands of people with past crimes on their records.

It “would be impossible to comply” with such a rule, she said.

The court’s three liberal justices appeared to agree with her, and several of the conservatives seemed to agree with parts of her argument.

Justice Elena Kagan questioned why a state attorney and a single judge “can bring a federal policy to a dead stop because the state can show a loss of $1.”

She was referring to rulings that said plaintiffs can have a standing if they can show a loss of any amount.

But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said Texas may have a good argument.

“What if I think ‘shall’ means ‘shall’?,” he told Prelogar. “It’s our job to say what the law is,” he said, even if it may be impossible for the government to comply.

The justices will likely hand down a ruling in United States vs. Texas early next year.",Police
latimes,Police,9274,latimes,"In 2018, Democrat TJ Cox had the distinction of winning the closest congressional race in the country, an 862-vote squeaker over Republican incumbent David Valadao.

Cox, a Fresno businessman and developer, faced ethical questions during the campaign, including a controversy regarding his primary residence. (He claimed two of his homes for tax purposes, which is illegal, and repaid a $692 credit he received from Montgomery County, Md.)

Still, Cox managed to pull off one of the biggest upsets of the midterm election, capping a nationwide romp that delivered control of the House to Democrats and shrank California’s GOP congressional delegation to the size of a small dinner party — just seven members.

On Tuesday, Cox achieved a more dubious distinction. The former congressman was arrested by FBI agents and briefly jailed after the federal government unsealed an indictment accusing him of swindling at least $1.7 million from business partners and several companies Cox owned. Some of the money was allegedly used to help finance his 2018 campaign.

Cox was also accused of fraudulently obtaining a $1.5 million construction loan

His arrest made national news. But the allegations weren’t a huge surprise to those in Washington and the Central Valley who were aware of Cox’s messy personal finances and the persistent questions surrounding his business operations.

During his one and only congressional term, he was dogged by other unsavory revelations: back wages owed to employees, nearly $145,000 in unpaid federal income taxes, a lien for unpaid state taxes. In 2020, Cox narrowly lost his reelection bid to Valadao, owing in no small part to the negative headlines and bad odor that attached to the freshman lawmaker during his scant time in office.

More startling, and risible, was Cox’s response this week to his federal indictment.

After a brief stint behind bars, he emerged from the Fresno County Jail — blue dress shirt, sans tie — and spoke to reporters. He began by praising the professionalism of the FBI and federal prosecutors, a notable and welcome contrast with a certain petulant, document-purloining ex-president. In a tone more sorrowful than angry, Cox proclaimed his innocence and vowed to wage a vigorous defense.

Then, cynically, he cast himself as a victim of political persecution.

“Politics is a tough game,” Cox said. “I wouldn’t be in this position but for the politics. I think we know that.”

The assertion is ridiculous on its face, unless one supposes the Justice Department under President Biden has been weaponized for the purpose of going after his fellow Democrats, including those like Cox who have left office and are no longer particularly relevant.

Toting an airport carousel’s worth of baggage, Cox wisely opted this year against pursuing a rematch with Valadao. Instead, he endorsed state Assemblyman Rudy Salas, whom Democrats spent years trying to recruit as their best hope of claiming the Central Valley seat. Salas’ race against Valadao — one of just two Republicans who voted to impeach Trump and survived their primary — is considered among the most competitive in the country.

Cox is, of course, innocent until proven guilty. Facing 28 criminal counts and the prospect of decades in prison and fines exceeding $1 million, he is well within his rights to say whatever he thinks will benefit his case.

But there is something sordid and cynical about pandering to those who believe the worst about government and its institutions at the very moment a former president of the United States is leading a reckless assault and inviting violence against law enforcement agencies, including the Justice Department and FBI.

The bureau says it’s investigating an unprecedented number of threats against its personnel and property after the legal search for classified documents wrongly stashed at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. The FBI also issued a joint intelligence bulletin with the Department of Homeland Security warning of violent threats against federal law enforcement, courts and government workers and facilities.

A good lawyer might win Cox’s case in court, or spare the ex-congressman extended jail time and a ruinous fine. But the best legal defense won’t salvage Cox’s reputation or preserve his personal integrity if he keeps making groundless and inflammatory accusations.

The donation, which is the largest gift from a single donor in the organization’s history, is part of Scott’s promise to give away most of the wealth she acquired through her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Scott, who is worth an estimated $49 billion, received a 4 percent stake in Amazon.com from the divorce.

“We are incredibly grateful for Ms. Scott’s extraordinary philanthropic investment in Planned Parenthood, as a critical part of the public health infrastructure,” Planned Parenthood Chief Executive Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.

“This funding will support our efforts to advance health equity by eliminating racial and structural barriers for our patients in the communities where Planned Parenthood works,” the statement added.

Abortion services make up 3 percent of the women’s health services Planned Parenthood provides, according to the organization. However, Planned Parenthood’s clinics perform an estimated one-third to one-half of all the abortions that take place in the U.S. each year, making it by far the largest abortion provider in the country.

In 2019, the most recent year for which data is available, Planned Parenthood performed almost 355,000 abortions, a sizable increase from the 321,000 abortions performed just three years earlier.

The organization has painted abortion as a cause for celebration at times, including earlier this month when its lobbying arm installed an “abortion rights” ice-cream truck distributing condoms at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.

“Ice cream, you scream, we all scream for abortion rights!” Alexis McGill Johnson tweeted earlier this month. “Catch us around SXSW and stop by to grab some free Bans Off swag, condoms, and education on the cold hearted policies of the Texas legislature. #BansOffOurBodies #SXSW.”

The truck was covered with pink and blue posters that read, “Ice Cream You Scream: Abortion Rights for All,” “Ice Cream as Cold as Texas Politicians,” “Join the Fight to Defend Abortion Access,” and “#BANSOFFOURBODIES,” the photo shows.

Meanwhile, Scott wrote in a Medium post on Wednesday that she has donated more than $3.8 billion to 465 non-profits since last June.

“Our team’s focus over these last nine months has included some new areas, but as always our aim has been to support the needs of underrepresented people from groups of all kinds. The cause of equity has no sides,” she wrote.

nationalreview,Abortion,9811,nationalreview,"President Biden defended his position on abortion in an exchange with a reporter at a press conference on Tuesday on the south lawn of the White House.

“Why do you support abortion as a Catholic, defying church teaching?” EWTN reporter Owen Jensen asked.

“I’ll tell you what, I don’t want to get into a debate with you on theology, but you know…well anyway,” Biden replied.

“But why? Why support abortion as a pro-life—” the reporter interjected. Biden answered, “I’m not going to make a judgment for other people.”

The exchange came after Biden received ashes from Cardinal Wilton Gregory to mark Ash Wednesday.

“I was with the cardinal this morning. He came over to give me ashes. We both prayed…for the people of Ukraine,” Biden told reporters.

While Biden is a practicing Catholic, he has repeatedly been criticized over his stance on abortion. The president wrote in his 2007 book Promises to Keep that he is “personally opposed to abortion,” however he doesn’t think has has the “right to impose [his] view on the rest of society.”

While Biden backed a constitutional amendment in 1982 that would have allowed states to overturn Roe v. Wade, Biden has since turned to support the Supreme Court’s ruling in the case.

Biden said Texas’s September 2021 law banning abortions at detection of a fetal heartbeat “blatantly violates Roe v. Wade,” adding “my administration is deeply committed to the constitutional right established in Roe v. Wade nearly five decades ago and will protect and defend that right.” During his 2020 presidential campaign, he also abandoned his long-held opposition to the Hyde amendment, which bars federal funding from going toward abortion.

The Biden administration in October revoked a rule, initially instated by the Trump administration, that banned federally-funded health care clinics from providing referrals for abortions.

nationalreview,Abortion,9672,nationalreview,"The number of abortions performed in Texas plummeted in the first month since a new law — which prohibits the procedure after a fetal heartbeat is detected — went into effect.

In September 2021, just 2,197 abortions were performed in Texas, a drop of 51 percent from 5,400 statewide abortions in August, according to new figures released by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.

The Supreme Court has declined the opportunity to review the law, dismissing most legal challenges to it. A unique enforcement mechanism in the law allows individuals to sue anyone who knowingly performs or abets an abortion after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, deferring enforcement to private citizens rather than the state. Since the Supreme Court decision, litigation has been ongoing to determine whether state actors such as the Texas attorney general or Texas Medical Board can enforce the legislation.

Some women have traveled to other states, such as Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana to obtain an abortion as a result of the law, the Dallas Morning News has reported. In December, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a coalition of pro-abortion clinics, activists, and lawmakers, proposing an initiative to make the state a “sanctuary” for abortion by subsidizing travel and lodging for out-of-state women seeking the procedure.

“We’ll be a sanctuary,” Newsom told the Associated Press at the time. “We are looking at ways to support that inevitability and looking at ways to expand our protections.”

The statistics also come as the Supreme Court is positioned to potentially reverse or weaken its decision in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion nationally, in the coming term. In December, the court heard oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks gestation. The case forces the court to reassess the standard of fetal viability, established by Roe as the line at which abortion can be regulated.

“Ice cream, you scream, we all scream for abortion rights!” Alexis McGill Johnson tweeted on Saturday. “Catch us around SXSW and stop by to grab some free Bans Off swag, condoms, and education on the cold hearted policies of the Texas legislature. #BansOffOurBodies #SXSW.”

The truck appears to be a form of protest against the recently enacted Texas law that prohibits abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy. Many comments under the social-media post expressed disgust over the “creepy” truck, with some suggesting it is repulsive to “sell abortion to kids.” The truck is plastered with pink and blue posters, which read, “Ice Cream You Scream: Abortion Rights for All,” “Ice Cream as Cold as Texas Politicians,” “Join the Fight to Defend Abortion Access,” and “#BANSOFFOURBODIES,” the photo shows.

Under the ice cream selections are pictures of colorful popsicles with descriptions of different types of condoms, such as “Ribbed,” “Glow in the Dark,” “Bubblegum,” “Ultra Thin,” “Studded,” and “Spidey.”

The law went into effect in September after the Supreme Court dismissed the opportunity to review it. However, the high court had allowed a legal challenge by abortion providers to proceed at the state level, until the Texas Supreme Court put an end to that litigation last week in ruling against the plaintiffs. The court’s decision is likely to result in the dismissal of their lawsuit. At the heart of the lawsuit, and the Supreme Court’s declining to consider the case, was the law’s somewhat novel and peculiar enforcement mechanism, which empowers private individuals rather than the state government to sue medical providers or any individual who performs, aids, or abets an abortion. Texas abortion providers are now likely to be deterred from violating the new law because of the extremely expensive litigation that would come with it.

While Planned Parenthood has loudly claimed that abortions make up only 3 percent of the women’s-health services it provides, it has recently resorted to theatrics, such as the Texas ice cream truck, that seem to tout abortion as a cause for celebration rather than a marginally used medical option.

Senators Tommy Tuberville (R., Ala.) and John Marshall (R., Ka.) both shifted from initially backing Califf’s confirmation to opposing him following outreach from pro-life groups, Politico reported on Wednesday.

The FDA in December permanently lifted requirements for women to obtain abortion-inducing pills in-person. Prior to that decision, Califf told the Senate Health Committee during his confirmation hearings that he trusted the FDA to decide the issue based on available data.

“Just a few days after Dr. Califf’s confirmation hearing, the FDA announced it would permanently allow abortion drugs to be available by mail order,” Tuberville told Politico in a statement. “I believe Dr. Califf will continue to advance this administration’s pro-abortion agenda, and I cannot support his nomination.”

Califf previously led the FDA during the Obama administration, and the Senate voted 89-4 at the time to confirm him.

A letter to senators organized by the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List noted that in 2016, during Califf’s tenure, the FDA changed the type of data it collects on adverse reactions to abortion pills from severe and fatal reactions to just fatal reactions.

“Under Califf’s leadership during the Obama Administration, the FDA significantly undermined the reporting and safety requirements on medication abortion, also known as chemical abortion,” the letter states. “The FDA needs a leader who will follow the science and prioritize the health and wellbeing of women and girls. Based on his past (successful) effort to weaken data and safety requirements for chemical abortion, we must oppose his nomination.”

When asked to define “woman” by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, she replied, “I can’t…I’m not a biologist.” Blackburn shot back, “The meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can’t give me a definition?”

“Senator, in my work as a judge, what I do is I address disputes. If there’s a dispute about a definition, people make arguments and I look at the law and I decide,” Jackson added, reiterating the methodical judicial approach she has historically applied.

Given the way the transgender debate has escalated, some Republicans are concerned about the future adjudication of cases dealing with gender identity, since some are likely to end up on the Supreme Court docket. As a nominee to the High Court, Jackson will continue to face scrutiny over her opinions on a range of cultural issues important to conservatives, including abortion, transgenderism, and racialized public school curricula.

During the Tuesday confirmation hearing, Blackburn pressed Jackson on critical race theory and whether it should be outlawed in public schools. Republican senators are likely to attempt to nail Jackson on her stance on abortion in the coming days.

“The fact that you can’t give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about,” Blackburn said. She cited the NCAA championship last weekend, where transgender athlete Lia Thomas outperformed and out-placed multiple female swimmers, some former Olympians, stripping them of their chances of advancing to finals.

“What message do you think this sends to girls who aspire to compete and win in sports at the highest levels?,” the senator asked.

Blackburn also questioned Jackson about her stance on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, which challenges the precedent set by the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade and which is currently before the Court.

“Do you commit to respecting the Court’s decision if it rules that Roe was wrongly decided and that the issue of abortion should be sent back to the states?” Blackburn asked.

“Whatever the Supreme Court decides in Dobbs will be the precedent of the Supreme Court. It will be worthy of respect in the sense that it is the precedent. I commit to treating it as I would any other precedent,” Jackson replied.

In the last couple of years, multiple Republican-dominated states, notably Florida and most recently Iowa, have passed or enacted legislation prohibiting the inclusion of biological men in women’s sports at the K-12 and collegiate levels. However, Republican governors in Indiana and Utah vetoed such legislation this week.

nationalreview,Abortion,9529,nationalreview,"The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday sent the case of Texas’s heartbeat abortion law to the state’s Supreme Court, likely delaying any decision on the statute, which allows private citizens to sue providers who perform abortions after a heartbeat can be detected.

The move comes as the U.S. Supreme Court decided that most legal challenges against the abortion law should be dismissed, aside from one filed against medical licensing officials. That case was sent to the 5th Circuit in New Orleans.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges wrote in a 2-1 decision Monday that the Texas Supreme Court must certify the case and determine whether the U.S. Supreme Court was right to allow the challenge against the licensing officials to move forward.

Circuit Judges Edith H. Jones and Stuart Kyle Duncan said the state’s Supreme Court should decide whether the Texas attorney general, the Texas Medical Board, and other licensing officials can enforce the law if it is violated.

The third judge, who dissented, argued the U.S. Supreme Court had already ruled on the matter.

“This further, second-guessing redundancy, without time limit, deepens my concern that justice delayed is justice denied, here impeding relief ordered by the Supreme Court,” Judge Stephen A. Higginson wrote in his dissent.

Lawyers told the Texas Tribune it is unusual to ask the state Supreme Court to step in after the U.S. Supreme Court has already weighed in. The move could mean it will be months before a decision is made in the case. In the meantime, the law will remain in effect.

While other state-level bans on abortion before 24 weeks have been blocked by the courts due to Supreme Court precedent, the Texas law has a unique enforcement mechanism that allows any individual to sue anyone who knowingly performs or aids in an abortion after a fetal heartbeat has been detected, removing the responsibility of enforcement from the state’s executive branch and placing it into the hands of citizens. Plaintiffs can earn up to $10,000 in damages through litigation.

As state officials are not in charge of enforcing the law, it has been difficult for opponents of the law to bring successful challenges against it.

“While all of these complicated legal questions are untangled, we already every day have our victory,”John Seago, legislative director for Texas Right to Life, told the Texas Tribune earlier this month. “Courts have allowed this law to stay in effect.”

nationalreview,Abortion,9557,nationalreview,"On the eve of Friday’s March for Life, the annual pro-life demonstration that’s expected to draw over 50,000 attendees from across the country, Catholics for Choice projected a pro-abortion message onto the largest Roman Catholic Church in North America.

“Pro-Choice Catholics You Are Not Alone,” the organization wrote in a message projected on the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The message was projected as a prayer vigil was taking place within the basilica for mothers and the unborn children who have been aborted.

With this year’s theme being “Equality Begins in the Womb,” the March for Life will advocate for the end of abortion and commemorate the over 62 million lives that have been lost since Roe v. Wade, the hallmark Supreme Court case that legalized abortion on a national level.

Ashley Wilson, the Director of Communications & Strategy at Catholics for Choice, wrote on Twitter, “I know that my faith teaches Catholics to honor personal conscience. And yet, the Catholic hierarchy seeks to polarize pro-choice Catholics and villainize people who make the moral choice to have abortions.”

“I am tired of feeling shame and stigma for being a pro-choice Catholic. And I’m not here for people to judge my own personal relationship with God,” she added.

Church leaders rushed to condemn the statement as sacrilegious.

Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, issued a statement rejecting the actions of the group.

“The true voice of the Church was only to be found within The Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception last evening. There, people prayed and offered the Eucharist asking God to restore a true reverence for all human life. Those whose antics projected words on the outside of the church building demonstrated by those pranks that they really are external to the Church and they did so at night – John 13:30,” he said.

Archbishop Salvatore J. Cordileone of the Archdiocese of San Francisco tweeted, “The attempted desecration is enormous. Diabolical. Mother Mary, pray for them, now and at the hour of death. Amen.”

Members of Catholics for Choice gathered in protest in front of the Supreme Court a few months ago after the bench dismissed most legal challenges to a Texas abortion law empowering private citizens to sue medical providers or individuals who perform or abet an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected. On Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case to the state’s Supreme Court for further review.

“We represent and amplify the majority of Catholics in the United States who support abortion rights. 68 percent of Catholics in the U.S. do not want to see Roe v. Wade struck down,” a representative from the group told Daily Signal reporter Mary Margaret Olohan in an interview.

The woman claimed that the Catholic Church’s teaching on abortion has evolved over the centuries, “with two major theologians St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine believing abortion was licit in the first trimester.” She alleged that Church doctrine supports abortion despite no pope ever declaring it so throughout papal history. Abortion is explicitly forbidden by Catholic doctrine and warrants excommunication from the Church for any confirmed Catholic who receives one.

This year’s March for Life comes after the Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in landmark abortion case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which centers on a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The case will force the court to reexamine the standard of fetal viability, established in Roe as 23-26 weeks of gestation, likely prompting a reversal of the 1973 decision, at which point the issue would be returned to state legislature.

nationalreview,Abortion,9552,nationalreview,"Thousands of pro-life demonstrators converged on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. Friday for the 49th annual March for Life with a collective conviction and commitment to defeating abortion in their lifetime.

Given the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, many protestors were filled with optimism that Roe v. Wade, the hallmark decision that legalized abortion nationally, would be overturned in the coming judicial season. In that event, the abortion issue would return to the state legislatures. That has begged the question: what will become of the March for Life if Roe is reversed?

The consensus among those whom National Review interviewed, including former Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker, is that the fight to defend the unborn would be far from over.

“I think the march would continue because there will be momentum to put pressure on policy makers to create a constitutional amendment. We’ve got to work together nationally to make sure there’s good legislation in the states to protect the sanctity of life,” he said.

“For so long we focused on the court of law, we’ve got to shift to the court of public opinion,” he added.

State legislative races will become increasingly crucial, he noted. Walker mentioned California’s latest policy promise to subsidize abortions for out-of-state residents if Roe is dismantled as an example of the work cut out for the pro-life movement even if it scores a victory at the Supreme Court.

“In many states it would be a matter of affirming what’s already on the books and making sure lawmakers and governors don’t backtrack on that,” he said. “But then you hear about Gavin Newsom not only maintaining abortion all the way through birth but actually providing financial resources for other people to come in from other states to receive abortions.”

Walker said he believes the current Supreme Court will overturn Roe and that “it’s very likely that Dobbs [v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization] will be the vehicle.”

The bench recently heard oral arguments on Dobbs, which deals with a challenge to a Mississippi law that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. The case naturally forces the court to revisit the standard of fetal viability, established as 23–26 weeks under Roe, potentially prompting a repeal of the original ruling.

“These justices have shown that they won’t to go back to the Founding principles and to what’s actually stated in the Constitution, not implied,” he said.

Some law scholars have contended that Roe stands on precarious legal foundations because it invented a “right to privacy” not enumerated in the Constitution.

At the march, Michael Nolan of the Diocese of Fort Wayne–South Bend said that Roe’s undoing will not end abortion, so advocates against it will still need to bring their voices to Washington.

“The cause is so foundational to who we are as human beings. I think because this is the national identity right here, I think the march will continue. If the issue goes back to the states abortion won’t go away. The life movement will still meet here,” Nolan said, adding that he’s confident the 1973 ruling will be struck down eventually.

James Bence and Thomas McClellan, of Father Gabriel Richard High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rejected the argument of many abortion proponents that men should be excluded from the conversation because they don’t personally experience pregnancy. “Creating and sustaining human life is a shared responsibility between both men and women,” McClellan said.

The pair seemed sure that the March for Life would remain important and would still be held each year no matter the high court’s conclusion.

”We will still need to advocate for life. If Roe v Wade is overturned, it’s up to the states, so we need to show support that we don’t want abortion to be allowed anywhere,” Bence added.

In the spirit of the event’s theme “Equality Begins in the Womb,” Down Syndrome advocate Katie Shaw, took the stage at the rally preceding the march to declare that’s she’s a testament that all life is valuable and that every person, regardless of medical condition, can contribute to society.

“I’m here today in the fight for the dignity of human life of all unborn babies diagnosed with a disability or not,” she said.

While morale was high among participants at this year’s March for Life, it was balanced with the mutual understanding that the mission to end abortion definitively, even if Roe is overturned, will require eternal vigilance.

nationalreview,Abortion,9889,nationalreview,"The Idaho House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy It includes a Texas-style mechanism that leaves enforcement to private citizens, rather than the state government, to sue abortion providers.

In a 51-to-14 vote, the state House approved the measure after the Senate passed it earlier this month. It now goes to the desk of Republican governor Brad Little, who is expected to enact it.

The legislation borrows from a Texas version that went into effect in September in that it allows any private individual to sue anyone who performs, aids, or abets an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around six weeks of gestation. However, the Idaho bill permits only family members, including the unborn baby’s father, siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, to file a lawsuit against the provider. The enforcement provision includes an exception for rape, forbidding the rapist involved in a pregnancy from suing a provider (but allowing relatives of the rapist to sue), as well as incest and medical emergencies, to protect the life of the mother.

The Supreme Court dismissed an opportunity to review the Texas law in September, allowing it to become active in the state, but it has allowed challenges from abortion clinics to proceed against state licensing officials. After many months of litigation, the state supreme court denied the petition of abortion providers in Texas in an unanimous ruling, declaring that licensing officials have no authority, direct or indirect, to enforce the Texas Heartbeat Act. For Texas abortion providers, violation of the Heartbeat Act probably means expensive litigation.

There is an Idaho fetal-heartbeat law on the books that deems it a felony for any medical practice to provide an abortion after a heartbeat is detected. The penalty is up to five years in prison. However, that law includes a “trigger” provision with the condition that a court must turn over a favorable ruling on a similar law somewhere in the country for it to go into effect.

Like the Texas law, the Idaho bill would allow plaintiffs to seek monetary damages, cash payments of $20,000, as well as legal fee amounts, from the abortion provider. Petitioners can sue up to four years after the date of the abortion.

The Idaho legislative action comes as the Supreme Court is scheduled to weigh in on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a landmark abortion case concerning a Mississippi law that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That cases forces the court to examine the standard of fetal viability, or 24–28 weeks of gestation, and whether abortion should be allowed prior to that. If the high court rules in favor of the Mississippi ban, Roe will effectively be reversed, deferring the issue to the states to create their own legislation permitting or barring abortion at various stages of pregnancy.

nationalreview,Abortion,9994,nationalreview,"Republican Arizona governor Doug Ducey signed a bill Wednesday restricting participation in women’s sports to female athletes and another bill banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

“Today I signed S.B. 1138 and S.B. 1165, legislation to protect participation and fairness for female athletes, and to ensure that individuals undergoing irreversible gender reassignment surgery are of adult age,” Ducey wrote in a statement. “This legislation is common-sense and narrowly targeted to address these two specific issues ⁠— while ensuring that transgender individuals continue to receive the same dignity, respect and kindness as every individual in our society.”

This legislation requires all Arizona public schools, and any private schools that compete against them, to expressly designate their interscholastic athletics teams based on the biological sex of the participating students.

“S.B. 1165 creates a statewide policy to ensure that biologically female athletes at Arizona public schools, colleges, and universities have a level playing field to compete,” Ducey added. “Every young Arizona athlete should have the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities that give them a sense of belonging and allow them to grow and thrive.”

Oklahoma’s governor signed similar legislation Wednesday barring males from participating in women’s sports, joining the coalition of Republican-dominated states enacting measures to defend female athletic spaces from unfair competition. Florida and Texas were among the first as well as the largest GOP bastions to pass such bills. Oklahoma’s version, called the “Save Women’s Sports Act,” was spearheaded with the support of more than a dozen young female athletes including the governor’s 14-year-old daughter, Piper.

The governor also signed a bill that “prohibits a physician from performing an abortion past 15 weeks gestation, except in a medical emergency.” Doctors who provide an abortion in violation of the law, if there is no qualifying exception, “are subject to be charged with a class 6 felony and if convicted, will have their license suspended or revoked,” according to the law’s description.

“In Arizona, we know there is immeasurable value in every life — including preborn life,” Ducey said. “I believe it is each state’s responsibility to protect them.”

nationalreview,Abortion,9946,nationalreview,"Idaho governor Brad Little, a Republican, signed a law on Wednesday modeled on Texas’s ban on abortions at detection of a fetal heartbeat.

The Idaho law allows family members of a “preborn child,” including the father, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and siblings, to sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 if they perform an abortion when the fetal heartbeat is discernible. A heartbeat is typically detectable at around six weeks of pregnancy.

“I stand in solidarity with all Idahoans who seek to protect the lives of preborn babies,” Little wrote in a letter to Idaho Senate president and lieutenant governor Janice McGeachin after signing the legislation.

However, Little also noted that he had concerns with law, writing “I fear the novel civil enforcement mechanism will in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.”

The law provides for exemptions in cases of incest or rape, however the law also requires a victim seeking an abortion to file a police report beforehand. An abortion is also permitted under the law in case of a medical emergency in which the pregnant woman’s life is threatened.

“I am particularly concerned for those vulnerable women and children who lack the capacity or familial support to report incest and sexual assault,” Little wrote. “Ultimately, this legislation risks re-traumatizing victims by affording monetary [incentives] to wrongdoers and family members of rapists.”

The law was widely backed by Idaho Republicans, who hold supermajorities in the state legislature. The state House passed the law 51-14 last week, with the Senate approving the bill 28-6 earlier in March.

There are four abortion providers in Idaho, all of them in the southern part of the state, according to the Idaho Statesman.

The Texas law banning abortions at detection of a fetal heartbeat, on which Idaho’s legislation is based, went into effect in September 2021 after the Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge against it.

Texas’s bill allows any private citizen to sue an abortion provider, or anyone who aids in obtaining an abortion, for $10,000. The Idaho law is slightly narrower, allowing only family members to sue, with the target of the suit limited to an abortion provider.

nationalreview,COVID,9455,nationalreview,"A U.K. advisory panel recommended against a fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose for elderly and at-risk populations, citing evidence that a third shot provides sufficient immunity.

The U.K. Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization advised against the fourth dose after data showed one booster shot — a third dose of an mRNA vaccine — offered enough protection against Covid-19 after three months, according to the Associated Press.

The panel recommended instead that as many people as possible receive a third shot to strengthen protection against infection.

“The current data show the booster dose is continuing to provide high levels of protection against severe disease, even for the most vulnerable older age groups,” said committee chair Wei Shen Lim, according to the AP.

“For this reason, the committee has concluded there is no immediate need to introduce a second booster dose, though this will continue to be reviewed,” Lim added.

The committee’s consideration of a fourth dose comes amid a spike in Covid-19 cases driven by the highly-transmissible Omicron variant. The U.K. has seen a surge of new cases and a staff shortage in hospitals as the virus — which is thought to be more mild than previous strains — spreads.

Late last month Israel became one of the first countries to administer a fourth vaccine dose after it approved the shots for individuals with weakened immune systems, elderly residents, and employees in care homes.

Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said earlier this week that he believes a fourth Covid vaccine shot will eventually be needed as protection from previous shots wanes over time.

“I will be surprised when we get that data in the coming weeks that it’s holding nicely over time—I would expect that it’s not going to hold great,” Bancel said, though he added that those who received third shots in fall 2021 are likely protected through the spring.

“Assuming Omicron is an acceleration to the endemic phase, I still believe we’re going to need boosters in the fall of ’22 and forward,” Bancel continued, noting that at-risk groups may need additional boosters for years.

Moderna projected in the third quarter of 2021 that its Covid vaccines would account for $15 billion to $18 billion in sales by the end of the year.

Last month, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC’s Squawk Box that another dose of the drugmaker’s vaccine may be needed sooner than expected because of the Omicron variant.

Addressing a health care conference held by Goldman Sachs, Bancel suggested that protection from the booster shot will diminish quickly, necessitating future vaccine doses.

“I will be surprised when we get that data in the coming weeks that it’s holding nicely over time—I would expect that it’s not going to hold great,” Bancel said.

The Moderna CEO clarified that people who received third shots in fall 2021 are likely protected through the spring.

“Assuming Omicron is an acceleration to the endemic phase, I still believe we’re going to need boosters in the fall of ’22 and forward,” Bancel continued, noting that at-risk groups such as the elderly may need additional boosters for years.

“We have been saying that we believe first this virus is not going away,” Bancel added. “We’re going to have to live with it.

Moderna reported a total revenue of $5 billion in the third quarter of 2021, saying at the time that it expected its Covid vaccines to account for $15 billion to $18 billion in sales by the end of the year. Those estimates were lowered from an earlier estimate of $20 billion in vaccine sales for 2021.

Bancel’s Thursday comments echo December remarks by Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who told CNBC’s Squawk Box that people may need a fourth vaccine shot sooner than expected because of the spread of the highly-contagious Omicron variant.

“When we see real-world data, will determine if the omicron is well covered by the third dose and for how long. And the second point, I think we will need a fourth dose,” Bourla said at the time.

The spread of the Omicron variant, while milder than previous variants of Covid, has led to a 227-percent rise in cases over the past 14 days, as well as a 65-percent increase in hospitalizations, throughout the U.S., according to federal and state data compiled by the New York Times.

nationalreview,COVID,9479,nationalreview,"National Economic Council Director Brian Deese attempted to paint a rosy picture of the U.S. economy on Wednesday, on the same day the Labor Department announced inflation increased at the fastest rate in 40 years in 2021.

Deese said during a White House press briefing that the U.S. is in a “uniquely strong economic position” despite Americans encountering rising prices and empty shelves in stores across the country.

He instead crafted a story in which the U.S. had excelled economically last year, noting that it experienced the largest decline in unemployment, most jobs created and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. However, he failed to acknowledge that those figures come in the wake of record destruction on the economy brought on by the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Given the unique strength of the United States economic recovery overall growth as well as the labor market we are well positioned to attack the challenges of prices and costs head on,” Deese said.

Wednesday’s Labor Department report showed that the consumer price index, a major inflation gauge, for all items surged 0.5 percent in December and 7.0 percent for the last twelve months ending in December, representing the largest annual spike since June 1982, when inflation hit 7.1 percent.

Deese said members of the press gave outsized focus to the annual 7 percent rate increase.

“If we are trying to look where we are headed to, the month-to-month changes are more instructive and most independent forecasters continue to project that we will see moderation in price increases over the course of 2022,” he said.

Deese called the price increases a “global phenomenon” that “reflect the nature of the global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis” and recovery.

He dodged a question about what he and other economic experts got wrong in predicting early last year that inflation would be short-lived, saying instead that other projections and forecasts came out differently than anticipated but for the better, such as employment.

“This is a global phenomenon it is connected to the pandemic and the issues that has raised, certainly the supply chain challenges that have evolved over the course of time through the delta variant and over the course of the fall have been issues that we’ve had to go and tackle head on but I think the nomenclature aside we find ourselves a position now where we are looking for a most forecasters are projecting that the price increases will moderate,” he said.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on Tuesday that monetary policy is limited in its power to curb inflation by the current era of persistently low interest rates.

“The economy has rapidly gained strength despite the ongoing pandemic, giving rise to persistent supply and demand imbalances and bottlenecks, and thus to elevated inflation. We know that high inflation exacts a toll, particularly for those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation,” he said.

nationalreview,COVID,9406,nationalreview,"During an interview with Politifact in May 2021, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci accidentally started to say that the United States collaborated with Chinese communists on gain-of-function research on coronaviruses before the pandemic erupted.

Referring to Republican Senator Rand Paul’s intense interrogation of him and his organization during congressional hearings over the last year, Fauci attempted to elucidate the extent of U.S. scientific cooperation with China prior to the first Covid-19 outbreak. Doubling-down on his claim that the U.S. did not directly fund high-risk lab experimentation that allegedly generated Sars-CoV-2, Fauci appeared to nearly admit that the U.S. had at least worked with the Chinese Communist Party on gain-of-function research.

“So in a very minor collaboration as part of a sub-contract of a grant, we had a collaboration with some Chinese commu… uh, Chinese scientists. And what he conflated with that is that we were involved in creating the virus, which is the most ridiculous majestic leap I’ve ever heard of,” he said.

“That’s actually preposterous. It was just unfortunate that he said that. It was said in an accusatory way that just made no sense and was not based on any fact at all,” Fauci added.

Earlier that morning in May, before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Paul had accused Fauci of “”juicing up” Covid-19 by allowing U.S. money to finance the Wuhan Virology Institute’s “gain of function research” through the NIH and then covering it up.

“Three million people have died from this pandemic, and that should cause us to explore all possibilities. Instead, government authorities, self-interested in continuing gain-of-function research, say there’s nothing to see here,” Paul said.

“For years, Dr. Ralph Baric, a virologist in the US, has been collaborating with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Virology Institute, sharing his discoveries about how to create super-viruses. This gain-of-function research has been funded by the NIH,” he added.

Fauci retorted: “Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely and completely incorrect. The NIH has not ever and does not now fund gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.”

Contradicting Fauci assurances, a top NIH official revealed in October that the U.S. did fund gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses in Wuhan and that EcoHealth Alliance, the U.S. non-profit that funneled NIH money to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was not transparent about the work it was doing.

Lawrence A. Tabak of the NIH told Republican Representative James Comer in a letter about a “limited experiment” the lab conducted to test if “spike proteins from naturally occurring bat coronaviruses circulating in China were capable of binding to the human ACE2 receptor in a mouse model.” The laboratory mice that contracted the modified bat virus “became sicker” than those infected with the unmodified bat virus.

nationalreview,COVID,9576,nationalreview,"The Los Angeles Unified School District has announced it will require students to wear high-grade, non-cloth masks due to the rise of the highly infectious Omicron variant.

As of Monday, students were expected to arrive at school wearing “well-fitted, non-cloth masks with a nose wire” and continue doing so at all times, even outside, per the district’s guidelines. Students who claim they cannot comply because of a disability, medical or mental health condition can receive an exemption.

Los Angeles County health authorities recommended phasing-out cloth masks due to evidence of waning efficacy, Shannon Haber, a spokeswoman for LAUSD, told the Associated Press. State health personnel say citizens should shift to surgical-grade or even thicker masks, such as N95 and KN95 masks.

Such a proposal seems to fly in the face of scientific studies finding that mild symptoms manifest in the majority of those who contract Omicron, especially children, despite the variant’s high transmissibility. Most students who catch Covid recover in short time and even unvaccinated children are at lower risk of severe outcomes than vaccinated adults. The district’s mask guidelines also fail to acknowledge the mounting evidence that masks can harm speech development and may have detrimental effects on the mental health of children.

The district is likely responding to the spike in cases in the metropolitan area, which reported a “very high” seven-day testing positivity rate of 16 percent, with more than 250,000 positive virus cases reported last week, according to the LA County Department of Health.

While schools are committed to reducing the spread of the virus on their campuses to prevent them from having to move instruction online, many have failed to address the negative repercussions of masking children, likely to be aggravated further by a tighter, thicker medical mask that makes it considerably more challenging to breathe.

Data on the long-term effects of masking children is unknown, but parents nationwide have complained that masks inhibit learning and academic performance, present a language barrier for early childhood education, and even pose a health risk of their own to members of an age group with otherwise statistically robust immune systems.

Since the pandemic began, Republican governors have battled with local school districts to enforce their mask mandate bans, designed to empower parents to decide for themselves whether they will send their children to school with a mask. In Virginia, the Youngkin administration has already been sued by multiple defiant school districts that doubled-down on their mask requirements in spite of executive action prohibiting them.

Students across the state have mobilized to resist the school rules anyway, showing up to class mask-less to await a likely penalty. There have been reports of Virginia schools segregating, or expelling, unmasked students to learn in isolation from classmates.

The December spike was the largest since 1982.

Meanwhile, the core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.9 percent year-over-year.

President Biden has claimed that supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is partially to blame for the rising inflation. Biden’s National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, called the price increases a “global phenomenon” that “reflect the nature of the global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis” and recovery earlier this month.

Biden has been patting himself on the back after the U.S. gross domestic product grew at 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter. He called the growth “no accident.”

“My economic strategy is creating good jobs for Americans, rebuilding our manufacturing, and strengthening our supply chains here at home to help make our companies more competitive,” Biden said.

“This case is not about whether folks should get vaccinated against COVID-19 — the court believes they should,” Brown wrote in a 20-page ruling. “It is not even about the federal government’s power, exercised properly, to mandate vaccination of its employees. It is instead about whether the president can, with the stroke of a pen and without the input of Congress, require millions of federal employees to undergo a medical procedure as a condition of their employment. That, under the current state of the law as just recently expressed by the Supreme Court, is a bridge too far.”

The Biden administration told the court that federal employees could be penalized for being unvaccinated beginning January 21. The judge said this put the employees at risk of “imminent harm” which is why he issued an order to halt the policy on the same day.

The decision comes after the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers last week. However, the justices allowed a vaccine mandate for health-care workers at facilities that receive federal funding to go into effect.

The ruling relied in part on that decision; the judge said the ruling in NFIB v. OSHA made it clear that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration can impose workplace safety standards, but not public health measures.

“Similarly, [the law] authorizes the president to regulate the workplace conduct of executive-branch employees, but not their conduct in general,” Brown wrote. “And in NFIB, the Supreme Court specifically held that COVID-19 is not a workplace risk, but rather a ‘universal risk’ that is ‘no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases.’”

Brown’s order applied to federal civilian employees and does not appear to affect the Defense Department’s vaccine mandate for members of the military.

Meanwhile, the administration’s vaccine requirement for employees of federal contractors was blocked by a federal judge last month.

nationalreview,COVID,9732,nationalreview,"New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell was seen flouting her own mask mandate at an indoor Mardi Gras ball on Friday, according to photos obtained by Fox News.

Cantrell was caught singing karaoke maskless with two other maskless women in 100 short videos taken at the mayor’s Mardi Gras Ball at Gallier Hall. The videos were posted online but later deleted less than an hour after Fox News asked the mayor’s office about the photos on Monday, according to the outlet.

None of the partygoers are seen wearing masks in any of the 360-degree photo booth videos from the party, the report said.

Cantrell’s maskless soiree comes one month after she reinstated the city’s indoor mask mandate for indoor public settings on January 11.

A spokesman for the mayor confirmed to Fox News that the city’s mask mandate and vaccination-or-test requirement, which requires people over the age of 5 to show proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test taken within the previous 72 hours to enter most businesses, will remain in effect through Mardi Gras Day on March 1.

“The mask guidelines and the vaccination requirement will remain in effect thru Mardi Gras,” said spokesman Beau Tidwell. “That has not changed and it will not change. Under the current guidelines, masks may be removed indoors while eating and drinking. While we did not see perfect adoption of the guidelines in every instance over the weekend, we were encouraged overall by the level of masking and vigilance we saw on the parade route and at ball events.”

Cantrell’s maskless appearance came days after the Louisiana Supreme Court rejected a request for a temporary restraining order and an expedited hearing on a lawsuit challenging the city’s mask mandate and vaccine mandate. The request came from more than 100 plaintiffs who argue the mandates are violating their constitutional rights.

Meanwhile, Cantrell is just the latest of many Democrats who have flouted their own Covid-19 restrictions during the pandemic.

Most recently, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti came under fire for appearing maskless at the Super Bowl in violation of Los Angeles County’s indoor mandate and SoFi Stadium rules that require masking when not eating or drinking. Garcetti was seen doing the same during the National Football Conference Championship two weeks prior, also at SoFi Stadium.

A photo appeared to show the mayor maskless at the championship game between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals, just two weeks after he was panned for being photographed maskless when the Rams and San Francisco 49ers faced off for the right to compete in the Super Bowl.

Garcetti, California governor Gavin Newsom, San Francisco mayor London Breed, actor Rob Lowe, Los Angeles Dodges manager Dave Roberts, and others appeared maskless in photos from the NFC Championship, prompting allegations of elitism and hypocrisy as well as rule-breaking.

After the playoff game, Garcetti claimed he held his breath while the photo was taken.

nationalreview,COVID,9520,nationalreview,"Tickets for the Beijing Winter Olympics next month will not be made available to the general public in response to Covid-19 concerns, the event’s organizing committee announced Monday.

“In terms of the grim and complex situation of epidemic prevention and control [and] in order to protect the health and safety of Olympic personnel and spectators, we have decided to change the original plan of public ticket sales,” the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee said.

China had already prohibited foreign spectators from attending the Winter Games.

The decision came less than two days after health authorities reported Beijing’s first case of the Omicron variant, sending one of the capital’s neighborhoods into immediate lockdown under the country’s “zero tolerance” policy for Covid-19.

The committee said it had crafted an “adapted program” to allow spectators that had been sufficiently screened and quarantined, a group that could include government workers, sponsors or government officials, according to the New York Times.

The International Olympic Committee released a statement on Monday: “The organizers expect that these spectators will strictly abide by the Covid-19 countermeasures before, during and after each event so as to help create an absolutely safe environment for the athletes.”

Organizers have created a “closed loop” plan to isolate athletes, spectators, journalists and Olympic workers within the three clusters of venues where the events will take place. The organizing committee had planned to allow vaccinated and tested spectators to buy tickets to enter the three bubbles before shifting gears on Monday.

Despite the closed loop system and strict mitigation measures, which would have still forced Chinese citizens to quarantine for 21 days after leaving the Games, the organizers felt the interaction between the Chinese public and the international crowd would pose too great a risk.

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed last month that the U.S. government delegation planned to boycott the Olympic Games over the Chinese government’s human rights abuses, including the presumed suppression of tennis star Peng Shuai.

“The Biden administration will not send any diplomatic or official representation to the Beijing 2022 winter Olympics and Paralympic Games given the PRC’s ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses. The athletes on team USA have our full support. We will be behind them 100 percent as we cheer them on from home. We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the games,” Psaki said.

She said American competitors will participate in the games without U.S. government presence.

nationalreview,COVID,9556,nationalreview,"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that the agency is working to “pivot the language” around who qualifies as fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to instead focus on who is as “up-to-date” with their shots as they “should be.”

“What we really are working to do is pivot the language to make sure that everybody is as up to date with their Covid-19 vaccine as they personally could be, should be, based on when they got their last vaccine,” Walensky said.

“We really want to make sure people are up-to-date,” she added. “That means if you recently got your second dose, you’re not eligible for a booster, you’re up-to-date. If you are eligible for a booster and you haven’t gotten it, you’re not up-to-date and you need to get your booster in order to be up-to-date.”

Walensky’s comment comes days after President Biden dodged a question on why the White House hasn’t changed the definition of “fully vaccinated” against Covid-19 to include a third booster shot and if the reason is that the number of fully-vaccinated Americans would suddenly look a lot less impressive.

He claimed that was not the reason the definition hadn’t been updated. When a reporter pressed him again he responded: “The answer is yes, get the booster shot it’s all part of the same thing. You’re better protected.”

With officials pushing Americans to receive their booster shots, many believed it was only a matter of time before the definition of “fully vaccinated” would shift from meaning two shots of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, to including a booster shot. A shifting definition could change the requirements of vaccine mandates across the country, including requirements for health care workers.

While the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers last week, the justices allowed a vaccine mandate for health-care workers at facilities that receive federal funding to go into effect.

CDC data show 39 percent of fully vaccinated people have gotten booster shots. However, some people may not be eligible for an additional shot yet if not enough time has passed since their most recent shot.

Meanwhile, three reports released Friday showed vaccine boosters provide robust protection against severe disease from the omicron variant in the U.S.

Data collected between August 2021 and January 5, 2022, show a third dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines was 90 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and 82 percent effective in preventing a trip to the emergency room or urgent care.

nationalreview,COVID,9952,nationalreview,"The Supreme Court will not reveal whether Justice Clarence Thomas remains in the hospital, after announcing on Sunday that the justice was hospitalized with flu-like symptoms.

Court spokeswoman Patricia McCabe said she had no updates on Thomas’s condition when asked by the Associated Press.

The Court clarified in a statement on Sunday that Thomas, 73, did not contract Covid. However, that statement also indicated that Thomas was expected to leave the hospital by Tuesday evening.

“He underwent tests, was diagnosed with an infection, and is being treated with intravenous antibiotics,” the Court said at the time. “His symptoms are abating, he is resting comfortably, and he expects to be released from the hospital in a day or two.”

During oral arguments on Wednesday, Chief Justice John Roberts said Thomas was “unable to be present today,” without elaborating further. Roberts added that Thomas would read transcripts from the arguments in order to participate in the cases heard on Wednesday.

Thomas, who was nominated to the Court by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, sits on the Court’s 6-3 conservative majority alongside Roberts and Judges Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Samuel Alito.

Thomas’s illness comes as the Senate holds confirmation hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer. Breyer, 83, announced in January that he intends to retire from the Court this summer so long as the Senate confirms his replacement.

If confirmed, Judge Jackson will join the Court’s liberal minority alongside Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.

nationalreview,COVID,9788,nationalreview,"Following the updated CDC guidance that relaxed Covid-19 masking recommendations, California, Oregon, and Washington state will drop their mask mandates for K-12 public schools in mid-March.

“With declining case rates and hospitalizations across the West, California, Oregon and Washington are moving together to update their masking guidance,” the governors announced in a joint statement Monday.

The new directive will also apply to most indoor settings in all three states in addition to schools.

Now that Covid transmission and hospitalization rates are decreasing nationwide, and the CDC is giving the green light, Democratic-dominated states on the east and west coasts are following suit ahead of President Biden’s Tuesday State of the Union address.

Many Republicans have argued that the science hasn’t changed, but public opinion on the matter and polling on party performance has, prompting the shift.

“Two years ago today, we identified Oregon’s first case of COVID-19,” Oregon Governor Kate Brown said in the statement. “On the West Coast our communities and economies are linked. Together, as we continue to recover from the Omicron surge, we will build resiliency and prepare for the next variant and the next pandemic.”

In California, masks will no longer be required but “strongly recommended” in indoor settings regardless of vaccination status starting Tuesday. The policy will be effective in schools and childcare facilities starting March 12, the statement said.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams and New York Governor Kathy Hochul recently nixed mask mandates for indoor settings and public schools. Adams also dropped the vaccine passport for indoor recreational venues in the city starting early March.

The inter-state movement to ease pandemic restrictions suggests a growing consensus that Covid-19 is becoming endemic, and that citizens must learn to live with it to avoid further disrupting economies, livelihoods, and children, who many parents claim have born the brunt of restrictions in the form of academic and social regression.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9770,nationalreview,"President Biden will sanction Russian president Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov directly as the Kremlin escalates a bloody full-scale military invasion of Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said today.

The White House had held off from imposing personal sanctions on Putin for the last couple days but promised to keep the option on the table. The sanctions package announced earlier this week primarily targeted Russian oligarchs and cronies of Putin, their families, and Russian banks. Despite bipartisan pressure from U.S. lawmakers, the Biden administration has not inflicted serious penalties on the Russian energy sector, which supplies much of the world’s natural gas and oil.

In his press conference yesterday afternoon, President Biden also confirmed that the latest U.S. actions didn’t include sanctions wouldn’t kick Russia out of the SWIFT system, a move which would make it difficult for Putin to engage in international finance and banking, because some European nations did not arrive at a consensus about it.

The White House’s announcement today came after the European Union and United Kingdom deployed sanctions hitting Putin and Lavrov specifically on Friday. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also announced Friday that he will impose sanctions against Putin and Lavrov “imminently.”

A major stakeholder in Russian oil company Surgutneftegaz, natural gas company Gazprom, and commodities trader firm Gunvor, Putin has amassed a fortune over the years, making him one of the richest men in the world. The sanctions are intended to hurt his stores of wealth.

“It’s been on the table for some time, but through coordination and discussion with our European partners over the last day or so,” Psaki told CNN about the latest U.S. sanctions against Russia.

So far, the U.S. has strategy has been to slap Russia with sanctions to deter Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. However, Biden has acknowledged that it will take some time for the regime to the feel the pain of the sanctions, which is time the Ukrainians don’t have as they’re currently under attack. Some bipartisan politicians have advocated for unleashing the full arsenal of sanctions instead of moving in lock-step with Putin’s escalations so as to put the onus on him to end the conflict in exchange for relaxing financial punishment.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9746,nationalreview,"German chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Tuesday that his government will halt the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of two separatist Ukrainian enclaves.

Nord Stream 2, which is controlled by a subsidiary of Russia’s state-owned energy corporation Gazprom, is completed and filled with gas but has not yet come online. Germany had expected to double imports of natural gas from Russia via the pipeline.

However, “the situation today is fundamentally different,” Scholz told reporters. “That is why we must re-evaluate this situation, in view of the latest developments. By the way, that includes Nord Stream 2.”

Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and current head of Russia’s National Security Council, mocked expected high energy prices in Europe in response.

“German Chancellor Olaf Scholz instructed to stop the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Well. Welcome to a new world where Europeans will soon pay 2,000 euros for a thousand cubic meters of gas!” Medvedev wrote on Twitter.

Russia provides over third of the natural gas used in Europe, according to a New York Times analysis, and Russian natural gas accounted for 27 percent of Germany’s energy supply in 2021. Germany is shutting down its remaining three nuclear power plants by December 2022 and closing coal-fired power plants by 2030, decisions which were expected to necessitate additional imports of natural gas from Russia.

Russia has ordered troops to enter two eastern regions of Ukraine recognized by President Vladimir Putin as independent, sparking condemnation from the U.S. and European nations. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky said in a televised speech on Tuesday that his country would not cede territory to Russia.

“We are committed to the peaceful and diplomatic path, we will follow it and only it,” Zelenskiy said, according to Reuters. “But we are on our own land, we are not afraid of anything and anybody, we owe nothing to no one, and we will give nothing to no one.”

nationalreview,Climate Change,9850,nationalreview,"President Biden on Tuesday announced the U.S. will ban Russian oil imports in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine,” Biden said during remarks at the White House.

“This is a move that has strong bipartisan support in Congress and I believe in the country,” he added. “Americans have rallied to support the Ukrainian people and made it clear we will not be part in subsidizing Putin’s war.”

The ban comes without European participation but was made in consultation with European allies, Biden said.

“We’re moving forward this ban understanding that many of our European allies and partners may not be in a position to join us,” Biden said. “The United States produces far more oil domestically than all the European countries combined.”

“We can take this step when others cannot, but we’re working closely with Europe and our partners to reduce their dependence on Russian energy as well,” he added.

The U.K. is also expected to announce plans to ban the import of Russian oil on Tuesday afternoon, Politico reported. The U.K. ban will include a months-long lead-in time to allow the global market to adjust and to dissuade people from panic-buying gas, officials told the outlet.

Biden faced bipartisan pressure to ban Russian oil and even stalled a bipartisan bill to do so, Fox News’s Jacqui Heinrich reported. The House Ways and Means Committee worked all weekend in a bipartisan manner to develop a bill, she reported. The White House then asked Ways and Means Democrats not to move forward on the bill. Sources reportedly told Heinrich the White House did not want to seem as though it had been boxed in by Congress on the issue.

Bloomberg News confirmed that Congress forced the administration’s hand on the Russian oil ban. Biden officials believed that it would be a “bad look” and asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to hold off on the bill, according to the report.

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for “boycotts of Russian exports, namely refusal from oil and oil products from Russia.”

“If the invasion continues and Russia does not change its plans, then the new sanctions package is needed,” Zelensky said. “New sanctions steps against the war, for the sake of peace.”

Zelenskyy called for “boycotts of Russian exports, namely refusal from oil and oil products from Russia.”

Meanwhile, U.K.-based Shell announced Tuesday it would immediately stop purchasing Russian crude oil and would shutter its service stations in the country in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on the same day the price for U.S. gasoline hit a record high.

Biden said Tuesday’s decision to ban Russian oil is “not without cost at home.”

“Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,” he said, warning that the ban will further increase the price of gas.

The U.S. national average price for regular gas hit $4.173 a gallon on Tuesday, surging past the previous record of $4.114 set in July 2008, according to AAA.

“I’m going to do everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home,” the president said.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9798,nationalreview,"“The U.S. did not double oil imports from Russia in the last year” reads a PolitiFact fact check of Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, which determined her claim was “mostly false” before conceding its accuracy.

In an appearance on Jesse Waters Primetime, Bartiromo stated that “the United States is also reliant on Russian oil. We’ve doubled our imports from Russia in the last year.” PolitiFact’s Yacob Reyes took issue with that assertion.

In a short, two-step summary topper of his article, Reyes writes that “the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that the U.S. increased its oil imports from Russia by about 28% in the first 11 months of 2021,” and that “the U.S. did double the amount of crude oil imported from Russia last year.”

“But,” he protests, “Russia accounts for only about 3% of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021.”

It seems fairly obvious, then, that Bartiromo was referring to crude oil imports, specifically rather than total oil imports both crude and refined. It takes Reyes until paragraph ten of the body of his piece to cite the statistics Bartiromo’s claim was predicated on; the U.S. imported 208,000 barrels of Russian crude oil a day in the first eleven months of 2021, a more than 100 percent increase over the 76,000 barrels a day it averaged over the course of 2020.

Even this, however, is minimized by Reyes, who takes issue with Bartiromo’s argument that this constitutes increased reliance on Russian oil. “Russia accounted for about 3 percent of overall U.S. crude oil imports in 2021,” he says, supposedly in contravention of Bartiromo. But that makes Russia the U.S.’s second largest supplier of foreign oil, as Reyes is forced to acknowledge.

“But it’s still a small number, and it’s irrelevant because it’s a global marketplace,” argues Reyes through Mark Finely, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute.

That doesn’t seem to comport with the Biden administration’s sense of things, however. The president has said that “defending freedom will have costs for us as well, and here at home,” and expressed his intention “to limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki issued a similar warning, responding to a question about rising gasoline prices resulting from sanctions placed on Russia by saying “yeah, energy prices, exactly that’s what we want the American public to be aware is a possibility.”

On Tuesday, the Biden administration even decided to release 30 million barrels of oil from the U.S.’s strategic petroleum reserve, which is meant to provide for emergencies. An additional combined 30 million will be released by other countries.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9763,nationalreview,"Senator Ben Sasse (R., NE) on Thursday excoriated John Kerry, the Obama-era secretary of state turned Biden administration presidential envoy for climate, for his response to the then potential — and now ongoing — Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“Who the hell does John Kerry think he is? And, more importantly, is he unaware that widespread war is now possible in Europe for the first time in 77 years? This man is not the Secretary of Defense; he’s not the Secretary of State. John Kerry has a made-up position as International Climate Scold. Now’s not a great time, John,” Sasse said in a statement provided to National Review.

In an interview on Monday, Kerry fretted that the conflict might distract from the threat of climate change, and expressed his “hope” that “President Putin will help us to stay on track with what we need to do for the climate.”

Russian president Vladimir Putin announced that his country would proceed with a “special military operation” in Ukraine late on Wednesday night in the United States and early in the morning on Thursday in Russia and Ukraine. Since then, Russian and Ukrainian forces have been clashing, and Russian airstrikes have hit both military and civilian targets.

President Biden has not yet addressed the American people, but has released a statement asserting that “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way.”

In his address, Putin warned “those who would be tempted to intervene . . . will have consequences that you never have had before in your history.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has said that “the government of Ukraine wants peace. It’s doing everything it can. We’re not alone. That’s true, lots of countries support Ukraine. Because this isn’t about peace at any price. It’s about peace, principles, justice, international law, the right to determine your own future.”

A state department spokesman responded to criticism of Kerry’s comments with the following statement: “Secretary Kerry strongly condemns the unprovoked and unjustified attack by Russian military forces. On Monday prior to the attack, he was asked about the climate implications of a potential future conflict.”

Kerry has also faced criticism from elected Republicans over his insistence on prioritizing cooperation with China on climate change over challenging the oppressive regime for its atrocious human-rights record.

“That’s not my lane,” Kerry said when asked whether he raised Beijing’s abuses with Chinese officials at the U.N. Climate Change Conference in November.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9747,nationalreview,"A coalition of prosecutors in Los Angeles overwhelmingly support a recall of progressive District Attorney George Gascón, who has come under fire recently for rolling back enforcement of laws against a number of offenses, including resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and making criminal threats.

The vast majority of members of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles, at 97.9 percent, voted to back a recall of Gascón. They’ve repeatedly objected to his policies, which they say have incentivized more crime by watering down the penal code.

“This vote is by those who are intimately familiar with how Mr. Gascón’s policies actually play out on a day-to-day basis,” ADDA president Michele Hanisee told Politico. “We believe the vote of our members will resonate with the voters of Los Angeles as they decide whether to recall Gascón from office and restore public safety as the priority of the District Attorney’s office.”

Another organization representing LA prosecutors confirmed there is a lot of momentum behind the movement to remove Gascón. The Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys (LAADDA) said over nine of ten prosecutors in the city want him recalled.

“It’s been one year of Gascon’s social experiment,” Eric Siddall, vice president of LAADDA, told Fox News. “I think after that one year, people have had time to evaluate whether this is working or not working. I think most people who actually live in Los Angeles [and] understand what’s going on in Los Angeles, including the political leadership here in LA, feel that this has been a miserable failure.”

The LAADDA has filed two lawsuits against Gascon claiming that some of his orders infringed on state law.

“One of the first things he did was create a set of directives — in other words, internal rules that DAs were supposed to follow. Some of those rules directly contradicted California state law,” Siddall added. “One was that we couldn’t file strikes pursuant to the three-strikes law. And the three-strikes law is a mandatory law. It’s something that the prosecutors don’t have the discretion to ignore.”

The LA County registrar approved the recall, after a similar one failed to garner enough signatures last year. To trigger an election, the recall campaign must collect between 800,000 and 900,000 petition signatures.

After pledging to stop prosecuting juveniles as adults or pursuing sentences of life in prison without parole, Gascón backtracked to say he would review the specific circumstances of each case before making a judgment. He also admitted Monday that he improperly handled the case of a 26-year-old transgender woman who was sentenced to just two years in a juvenile facility for sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl at the age of 17. After his move provoked outrage, Gascón promised to try the woman as an adult rather than a child.

“While for most people several years of jail time is adequate, it may not be for Ms. Tubbs,” the progressive DA said in a statement. “If we knew about her disregard for the harm she caused we would have handled this case differently. The complex issues and facts of her particular case were unusual, and I should have treated them that way.”

nationalreview,Climate Change,9844,nationalreview,"President Biden conceded that his administration is not able to strongly influence rising gas prices, in comments to reporters on Tuesday.

“They’re gonna go up,” Biden said of gas prices after landing for a visit in Fort Worth, Texas. The average price of a gallon of gas hit a 14-year high of $4.009 on Sunday, according to AAA.

“Can’t do much right now,” Biden said when asked what he can do about the situation. “Russia is responsible.”

Biden’s remarks come hours after he announced a U.S. ban on Russian energy imports including oil, liquefied natural gas, and coal. The ban comes amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

“The decision today is not without cost here at home. Putin’s war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,” Biden said on Tuesday morning. The president added that he is doing “everything I can to minimize Putin’s price hike here at home,” including releasing oil from the strategic reserves of the U.S. and allies.

About 8 percent of all oil and petroleum imports to the U.S. in 2021 came from Russia, according to the Energy Information Administration.

The Biden administration was initially hesitant to block Russian oil imports, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki saying last week that “reducing the global supply of energy” would “raise prices at the gas pump for the American people.” However, the administration faced pressure from both parties in Congress over an import ban, according to reports from Fox News and Bloomberg.

Republicans and some Democrats, such as Senator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.), have called to increase domestic oil production to offset the losses from a ban on Russian imports. Republicans in particular have castigated the Biden administration over policies including opposition to new oil production leases on federal lands and the cancelation of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have expanded imports from Canada.

“It’s simply not true that my administration or policies are holding back domestic energy production,” Biden said during the Tuesday morning announcement. Biden said just 10 percent of oil drilling in the U.S. occurs on federal land, and that there are at least 9,000 “permits to drill now” that oil companies aren’t using.

However, oil companies can face regulatory requirements such as safety and environmental inspections that significantly delay the start of drilling, a fact check by The National Desk noted. Companies are also facing a labor shortage and supply-chain issues, CNN has reported.

Sources told the New York Times about the scheduled trip, which marks the highest level visit by Washington officials to Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, in years. The delegation includes senior officials from the State Department and the White House, according to the report, and it was not immediately clear how long the group would stay in Caracas or with whom the group plans to meet.

While the U.S. cut ties with Maduro’s administration and closed its Caracas embassy in 2019, U.S. officials have zeroed in on Venezuela as one of Russia’s last remaining international allies as many countries have shunned the Kremlin over the Ukrainian invasion.

After the Trump administration sanctioned Venezuelan oil exports and the country’s senior officials, Maduro turned to Russia, China and Iran for economic and diplomatic help. Since then, Russian energy companies and banks have helped Venezuela to continue to export oil, which is the country’s biggest source of foreign currency.

Ahead of the Russian attack on Ukraine, Russia’s deputy prime minister met with Maduro’s government in Caracas. Maduro has stayed in contact with Putin, speaking at least twice in the past month, according to the report.

The U.S. is both concerned about potential security threats from Russia’s Latin American allies if tensions continue to rise with the Kremlin, as well as hopeful that Latin American autocracies may begin to see Russian President Vladimir Putin as a weak ally, the New York Times reported.

In discussions about potential sanctions against Russian oil and gas exports, some Americans have suggested Venezuela may be able to replace Russia’s oil and gas exports

During a speech on Thursday, Maduro said Venezuela’s oil is “available for whomever wants to produce and buy it, be it an investor from Asia, Europe or the United States.”

The U.K.-based company’s decision comes as the U.S. national average price for regular gas hit $4.173 a gallon on Tuesday, surging past the previous record of $4.114 set in July 2008, according to AAA.

Shell said it plans to immediately end purchases of Russian crude oil on the spot market and not renew contracts, unless given other direction from governments. The company said it would shift its supply chain to excise Russian crude completely.

Shell said the move, which follows a decision last week to dump its investments in Russia, is “aligned with new government guidance.”

“We will do this as fast as possible, but the physical location and availability of alternatives mean this could take weeks to complete and will lead to reduced throughput at some of our refineries,” Shell said in a statement.

The company will also start shuttering its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia while kickstarting a phased withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and liquified natural gas.

Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden apologized for the company’s purchase of a cargo of Russian crude for refining into gas and diesel last week.

“We are acutely aware that our decision… despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking — was not the right one and we are sorry,” he said.

The company pledged to donate profits from the remaining barrels of Russian oil it processes to a fund to help the people of Ukraine.

In nearly two weeks since Russia first invaded Ukraine, Russia has been hit with a number of sanctions by the West. However, its energy exports have thus far been excluded from the sanctions, though U.S. officials are discussing banning imports, according to CNN.

The Kremlin on Monday threatened to cut supplies of natural gas to Germany in response to its decision to end Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. Russia warned that oil prices could hit $300 a barrel if the West bans Russian oil.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9748,nationalreview,"Following President Biden’s announcement of a punitive sanctions package against Russia as retaliation for its creeping incursion into Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Tuesday that Americans should expect already sky-high energy prices to climb further.

During a press briefing, multiple reporters asked Psaki to address the cost burden Americans might incur as a result of the sanctions, which target Russian oligarchs and certain banks and aim to cut off the country from western financing. Germany also officially cancelled operation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as punishment. The pipeline was built to supply European nations with natural gas from Russia.

A reporter asked, “So, Americans should expect higher gasoline prices?” to which Psaki replied, “Yeah, energy prices, exactly that’s what we want the American public to be aware is a possibility.”

Biden slapped Russia with new “swift and severe” sanctions less than 24 hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin declared two separatist regions in Ukraine’s eastern flank independent republics and Russian troops started deploying to occupy the zones under the auspices of “peacekeeping.”

Psaki failed to explain how the Biden administration would help cushion Americans from likely gas-price increases stemming from what it is calling a “first tranche” of sanctions. She promised that more financial weapons, such as export controls, can be unleashed if Putin proceeds with provocation and military escalation further past Ukraine’s borders.

Another reporter asked, “When can we expect a more detailed explanation from the White House about how it would plan to bring down energy prices?”

“A lot of what’s happening right now is sensitive. It includes a lot of conversations with foreign counterparts and other major large global suppliers. It also includes conversations we’re continuing to have with Congress and others about what steps may be at our disposal and the president is continuing to consider options,” Psaki responded.

“Why should Americans feel that that is a cost they should have to bear and that should affect their lives and how much should they be prepared for this geopolitical crisis to impact their day to day lives?” another reporter asked.

Psaki reiterated that penalizing Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity is about standing up for our “values” and “principles” as a nation while acknowledging that it will not be painless for Americans. She said Biden is in consultation with his national-security team to “leave no stone unturned” and “tap into the resources of global suppliers” to “reduce the impact on the American people.”

Potentially to minimize the burden, Psaki said the Biden administration is talking to natural-gas producers to understand their capacity and see if they’re able to surge their production to meet impending shortages.

With Russia being the third-largest producer of oil in the world and the second-largest producer of dry natural gas, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the sanctions are projected to trigger serious oil-supply disruptions, sending energy prices higher globally.

Americans are already saddled with mounting domestic inflation, having witnessed the highest prices at the pump since at least 2013 with a barrel of oil approaching $100 for the first time in seven years, Barrons noted. Brent crude oil hit an intraday high of $99.50 a barrel on Tuesday.

The Ukraine crisis has exposed how the western world is handicapped by its dependence on Russian energy — especially Europe, which gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9799,nationalreview,"Senator Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) called on the Biden administration to ban imports of Russian oil and step up domestic energy production in a statement on Monday evening, a day before President Biden’s State of the Union address.

According to Manchin, the U.S. is importing “more than half a million barrels per day” of crude oil and petroleum from Russia while the Russian military is invading neighboring Ukraine.

“This makes no sense at all and represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s energy security,” said Manchin, who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The U.S. must “ramp up domestic energy production…to both protect our energy independence and support our allies around the globe.”

Manchin added, “I am calling on the Administration and industry partners to take action immediately, up to and including banning crude oil imports from Russia.”

President Biden moved to halt all new oil and gas production leases on federal lands after taking office in 2021, in an attempt to fight climate change. Biden also revoked a presidential permit for the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, leading developers to scrap the project in June.

Senator Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) called to lift restrictions on oil and gas leases, in a Friday interview on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle. However, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said rescinding those policies would not be effective in comments to Fox on Tuesday.

“They are not policies that would address the issue at all,” Psaki said. “This Keystone pipeline—it would take years for that to have an impact on prices.”

Psaki claimed that “there are also 9,000 approved oil leases that companies are not tapping into.”

The Biden administration’s ban on new oil and gas leases is currently the subject of a court battle. The administration said in a court filing on February 22 that it would delay all new oil and gas leases indefinitely while it finds a regulatory solution for new leases, in accordance with a February 11 court order.

Oil prices have risen sharply since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Germany, a key importer of Russian natural gas, indefinitely suspended the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has already been built and was intended to double natural gas imports.

nationalreview,Climate Change,9882,nationalreview,"The West Virginia legislature recently passed a bill that would allow the state treasurer to restrict the state’s business with financial institutions that adopt corporate policies to cut off financing for the coal, oil, and natural gas industries.

The legislation, which was first proposed by state Treasurer Riley Moore, advanced through the state House of Delegates and Senate over the weekend and now heads to the desk of Republican Governor Jim Justice.

If Senate Bill 262 becomes law, Moore will be able to create a list of restricted financial institutions that “have been shown to refuse, terminate or limit commercial activity with coal, oil or natural gas companies without a reasonable business purpose,” his office said in a statement on Monday.

Companies on the restricted list may be excluded from eligibility for state banking contracts “ensuring that financial institutions are not entrusted with the state revenue and taxpayer dollars they are attempting to diminish,” Moore’s office said.

“I am proud to lead the way to protect our coal, oil and natural gas companies from unfair, anti-American attempts to cut off their access to capital and banking services,” Moore said in a statement. “The current situation in Europe clearly demonstrates the dangers of letting woke capitalists weaken and destroy our domestic energy producers. It’s time to fight back against those who are trying to wipe out thousands of middle-class jobs, and once again put America first and restore our energy independence.”

A spokesperson for Moore told Bloomberg West Virginia has paid banks annual fees ranging from thousands of dollars to upwards of $3 million. Moore’s office does not have a list of financial institutions it expects would be restricted by the proposal, according to the report.

The bill’s passage in the state legislature comes months after Moore led a coalition of financial officers from 15 states that warned the U.S. banking industry in November that they plan to take “collective action” against banks that cut off financing for the coal, oil, and natural gas industries.

The group threatened to scrutinize or potentially curtail future business with banks that adopt an “economic boycott” of those industries in a letter to financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs.

The group included state treasurers, auditors and comptrollers from West Virginia, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Alabama, Texas and Kentucky.

The letter put the financial institutions that have “adopted policies aimed at diminishing a large portion of our states’ revenue” on notice, saying the banks have “a major conflict of interest against holding, maintaining, or managing those funds.”

“This is not really a boycott,” Moore told National Review at the time. “I’m a market participant and I’m exercising my preference not to work with these banks.”

He added that the treasurers “want banks to go back to being banks and not instruments of this woke agenda,” saying that “woke capitalism” is “nonsense.”

The treasurers noted in November that the coal, oil and natural gas industries provide well-paying jobs, health insurance, basic infrastructure and quality of life to citizens in every state.

In comments to National Review at the time, Moore accused the banks of trying to control Americans’ lives.

“They sold us on globalization and now the only businesses in our small towns are Walmarts. Now they want to eliminate one of the only remaining industries that gives West Virginians a good living.”

nationalreview,Economy,9997,nationalreview,"A key inflation metric monitored by the Federal Reserve soared 6.4 percent in February compared to a a year ago, reaching a new 40-year high.

The latest price surge, which affected the price of fuel, groceries and other consumer essentials, represents the largest year-over-year increase since January 1982, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.

Not taking into account food and energy fluctuations, which tend to be more erratic and can overemphasize inflation, the personal consumption expenditures price index, the preferred inflation gauge of the Federal Reserve, jumped 5.4 percent in February from a year prior. Including gas and groceries, PCE surged 6.4 percent.

Amid persistent supply chain problems, the inflationary pressures have intensified due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has suffocated energy markets and triggered a chain reaction of price leaps across other sectors.

Consumer spending in February, only 0.2 percent, fell below projections of 0.5 percent, showing that the mounting inflation has imposed significant costs on the American wallet, namely the diminution of purchasing power. The increase in disposable income, 0.4 percent for the month, also missed the 0.5 percent projection. Real disposable income dropped 0.2 percent, factoring in the rising cost of living nearly nationwide.

After insisting for many months that the persistent inflation trend was “transitory,” the Fed abandoned that reasoning and has pivoted to a monetary tightening regime this quarter. The central bank increased interest rates in March and is expected to add additional hikes at each of the remaining meetings this year to curb inflation.

nationalreview,Economy,9411,nationalreview,"Facebook “permanently disabled” the ads account of Heroes of Liberty after it said the conservative children’s book publisher’s posts — which promoted books about Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and former President Ronald Reagan — violated the company’s policy against “low quality or disruptive content.”

Facebook first locked the account on December 23, telling the publisher its account, ads and some of its advertising assets were disabled because it failed to comply with the policy, according to Fox Business.

Heroes of Liberty appealed that decision, at which point Facebook chose to permanently disable the account.

“After a final review of this ad account, we confirmed it didn’t comply with our Advertising Policies or other standards,” Facebook told the publisher. “You can no longer advertise with this ad account and its ads and assets will remain disabled. This is our final decision.”

Heroes of Liberty editor and board member Bethany Mandel questioned if a children’s biography of Ronald Reagan is “no longer permissible on Facebook” in comments to Fox Business.

“We don’t know,” she said. “But apparently promoting one may well kill a business.”

“We began investing in Facebook four months before we launched our first book,” she added. “We invested most of our marketing budget on the platform, and now our budget (the money we’ve already spent), as well as our assets and data are gone. Marketing-wise we are back in square one, financially it’s even more challenging.”

The publisher, which officially launched on November 14, began investing resources to build a brand on Facebook back in July. It used the ads account to promote and sell books, promoting 68 ads between November 23 and December 23 alone. More than 95 percent of the money spent on ads during that time went to ads ranked “average” or “above average” in Facebook’s quality score, according to the report. Just three ads were rated below “average.”

“There was a small but noisy group of responders to our ads who didn’t like the fact we published books about Ronald Reagan, Thomas Sowell and Amy Coney Barrett; people we called Heroes of Liberty,” Mandel told the outlet. “They made nasty comments, especially about Reagan, and about us for publishing these books and even shared their desire to burn them.”

“It’s very likely those same people reported to Facebook that our content is disturbing, because it doesn’t sit well with their radical worldview,” she said. “These are the same people who riot and take down statues of our founding fathers in the real world, and they want to strip us of our ability to honor our Heroes in the digital sphere and in children’s books.”

She accused Facebook of seemingly going with the “mob judgment call” rather than “common sense.”

nationalreview,Economy,9587,nationalreview,"The Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it will likely raise interest rates in March as part of a monetary policy shift to temper an over-heating economy and soaring inflation.

“The committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that the conditions are appropriate for doing so,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said at a press briefing.

With inflation far exceeding the central bank’s 2 percent target, the Fed plans to increase the cost of borrowing to slow down economic activity, which will hopefully moderate the price surges across commodities and commercial sectors. Prices are increasing at the fastest pace in almost four decades, with 7 percent annual inflation in December. A supply-chain crisis marked by prolonged shipping delays and production bottlenecks is still ongoing and exacerbating inflationary pressures.

Powell also said that the Fed will start to unload its massive balance sheet by tapering off its large-scale purchases of bonds and other assets, a program which the Fed has sustained for many years and which has injected enormous monetary stimulus into the economy. The Fed currently maintains a portfolio of over $8 trillion worth of U.S. government bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

He said that inflation “has not gotten better. It has probably gotten a bit worse. . . . To the extent that situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to reflect that,” Reuters reported. “This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy we put in place to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic.”

However, Powell still kept a sense of optimism that the inflation so many consumers are feeling at the gas pump and across a diverse range of products will have an expiration date, possibly in the near term. “Like most forecasters we continue to expect inflation to decline over the course of the year,” Powell said Wednesday.

The stock market tumbled in response to Powell’s monetary tightening announcement. Low-interest policies often have the effect of fueling financial market booms, which is why warnings of rate hikes rarely bode well for them.

nationalreview,Economy,9872,nationalreview,"President Biden on Friday called on Congress to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation status,” which would downgrade the country as a U.S. trading partner and potentially result in devastating tariffs against Moscow.

In addition to revoking normal trade relations, Biden announced a new tranche of economic sanctions that include cutting Russia off from international borrowing privileges and imposing more export and import restrictions as well as additional penalties on Russian elites and their families. Oligarchs that will be targeted include Yuri Kovalchuk, a Russian billionaire businessman and financier who is associated with Vladimir Putin’s personal banking, executives of Russian banks already sanctioned by the U.S., and Duma members who sponsored legislation to recognize the two Ukrainian separatist regions of the Donbas as independent republics.

As part of the pressure campaign, the U.S. and its partners will take action that undermines the profits these individuals have made off the war and that cuts them off “from the U.S. financial system, freezes any assets they hold in the United States and blocks their travel to the United States.”

Biden announced the sanctions during a press conference Friday. As punishment for its continued attacks on Ukraine, Russia will be denied the opportunity to borrow from the World Trade Organization and International Monetary Fund.

In order to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status, Congress must vote to remove the country from the World Trade Organization — an effort that is expected to receive bipartisan support.

“Together with similar actions by the G7, following our respective national processes, this collective action by more than half of the global economy will deliver another serious economic blow to Russia,” the White House wrote in a statement.

“I think we should use Article 21 ability under the WTO to revoke that,” Senator Rob Portman (R., Ohio) said Thursday during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing.

G7 countries and the European Union are expected to take the same step in the coming days and Canada has already revoked Russia’s status.

The export of luxury goods to Russia as well as the U.S. import of commodities from several Russian sectors including seafood, spirits/vodka, and non-industrial diamonds will also be prohibited. The U.S. Treasury will also release guidance on preventing sanctions evasion through cryptocurrency and the blockchain, which could be a loophole for financial transactions.

While the western world has inflicted severe damage on Russia’s ability to participate in the international economy, it has not yet fully cut off Russia from SWIFT, a system that facilitates payments in international finance and banking, due to European resistance, although there has been a selective ban of certain Russian banks. Given that the West, including the United States, is dependent on Russia for energy, there is fear among many nations that removing all Russian banks from SWIFT could cause major disruption to global energy markets with terrible economic fallout.

nationalreview,Economy,9842,nationalreview,"Average U.S. gas prices jumped to $4.009 per gallon Sunday, the highest since late July 2008, as Russia contends with the fallout of global sanctions for invading Ukraine.

The average price, calculated by AAA, soared 11 percent over the past week alone. Gas was an average of $3.604 one week ago and just $2.760 one year ago.

The current cost of gas is the highest since gas prices hit a record $4.114 a gallon on July 17, 2008, according to automobile club data cited by Reuters. At that time, U.S. crude futures jumped to a record $147.27 a barrel.

Californians are paying the most at the pump, where gas is an average of $5.288, according to AAA. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, average gas prices have reached $5 for regular fuel, while some stations are reportedly selling premium gas for more than $7 a gallon.

Hawaii, where gas is $4.695, is the second most expensive, while Nevada and Oregon round out the top four with an average of $4.526 and $4.466 respectively, according to AAA data.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, told USA Today that more cities are likely to see prices hit $5 a gallon in the coming weeks. He added in a tweet on Saturday: “To make it implicitly clear, this is the cost of bipartisan sanctions on Russia for their war on Ukraine.”

He said prices soaring to an average of $4 a gallon “was unlikely to have happened without Russian action.”

GasBuddy said last week’s increase of 41 cents per gallon was the second largest ever, behind only a jump of 49 cents per gallon during the week of September 3, 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

GasBuddy predicts a national average price of $4.25 by Memorial Day, higher than the current record of $4.10, unless something significant changes.

“Seasonal factors including increased demand for gas, refinery maintenance and the switch to summer blend gas, on top of current geopolitical tensions, could propel prices upward of $4.25 per gallon by Memorial Day,” GasBuddy said in a statement.

Meanwhile last week, President Biden announced that the U.S. and 30 other countries were working to release 60 million barrels of oil from strategic reserves around the world, including 30 million barrels from America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to “help blunt gas prices here at home.”

nationalreview,Economy,9667,nationalreview,"The consumer price index went up by 7.5 percent over the last year, the highest annual increase since February 1982.

Inflation increased at the fastest rate in 40 years over the last twelve months, outpacing projections, the U.S. Department of Labor announced Thursday.

The consumer price index (CPI) — a major measure of inflation covering a variety of consumer goods — surged 0.6 percent over the last month and 7.5 percent over the last twelve months ending in January. That represents the largest annual spike since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.62 percent.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also went up by 0.6 percent in January, following another 0.6 percent increase in December. This marks the seventh time in the ten months that it has increased at least 0.5 percent. The Core CPI increased by 6.0 percent annually, the steepest 12-month jump since

 the period ending August 1982.

Food, electricity, and shelter contributed the most to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. Energy prices picked up 0.9 percent for the month, with rising electricity costs being somewhat offset by declines in gasoline and natural gas costs.

The persistent inflation, exacerbated by a supply chain crisis marked by production bottlenecks and shipping delays, has prompted the Federal Reserve to switch strategy. Starting in March, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated, the central bank could start to reverse its accommodative monetary policy and hike interest rates to curb spiraling inflation. The Fed is also likely to start unloading its gigantic balance sheet and roll back the pace of its large scale asset purchases that have been injecting stimulus into the economy for years.

While pressure is piling on the Fed to slow inflationary pressures strangling many Americans at the gas pump, grocery store, and across goods and services, the stock market is expected to react poorly in the event of an interest rate increase. After Powell’s announcement of quantitative tightening, major stock indices the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite dipped 1 percent, 0.9 percent, and 0.7 percent, respectively. The tradeoff for combating inflation is often a drag in economic production, although while restoring purchasing power to consumers.

For months, the Fed maintained its monetary easing despite mounting inflation, projecting that the price hikes would temper as market imbalances rectified. However, that prediction proved wrong, as supply and demand mismatches continued and inflation has climbed each consecutive month since early 2020. Powell suggested recently that if the Fed doesn’t intervene, inflation could intensify.

“Inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants, and certainly in my view as well. There’s a risk that the high inflation we are seeing will be prolonged. There’s a risk that it will move even higher. So, we don’t think that’s the base case, but, you asked what the risks are, and we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes,” he said recently.

nationalreview,Economy,9513,nationalreview,"Half of respondents in a new CBS News poll released Sunday said they were “frustrated” and “disappointed” with President Biden’s presidency.

The poll, which comes days before Biden marks his first full year in office, found 40 percent of respondents said Biden’s presidency made them feel “nervous” and just 25 percent of respondents said it made them feel “calm” and “satisfied.”

The survey revealed a bleak outlook among a majority of respondents, with 75 percent saying they felt America was doing “somewhat” or “very” badly in a general sense.

Americans gave Biden poor scores on a number of issues. A majority of respondents disapproved of his handling of the economy, immigration, race relations, crime, inflation, policing and Afghanistan. Respondents were split on Biden’s Covid-19 response, with 49 percent saying he was doing a good job and 51 percent saying he was doing poorly.

Seventy percent of respondents said that improving inflation would make their opinion of the president more favorable.

The results, which have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, are based on a survey of 2,094 U.S. adults that was conducted from January 12 to 14.

The survey comes on the heels of a Quinnipiac poll released last week that revealed a plurality of Americans believe Biden is doing more to divide the country than to unite it.

Forty-nine percent said Biden is doing more to divide the country, while 42 percent said he’s doing more to unite the country, the poll found. The results are an indication that President Biden has so far failed in his mission to unify the country, though he repeatedly vowed to bring Americans together on the campaign trail.

The Quinnipiac poll painted a grim outlook among Americans, as a majority of respondents —58 percent — believe the nation’s democracy is in danger of collapse. Seventy-six percent believe political instability within the U.S. is a greater danger to the country, while just 19 percent said other countries that are adversaries of the U.S. are the bigger danger. The poll was conducted January 7-10, immediately after the one-year anniversary of the January 6 Capitol riot, which Congressional Democrats and Biden himself commemorated with a series of events and speeches about the importance of unity.

Biden’s image has taken a series of hits recently: a failure to shepherd his landmark Build Back Better plan through Congress, inflation that has increased at the fastest rate in 40 years over the last 12 months, and a surge in the highly-transmissible omicron variant that has left Americans desperately scrambling to find Covid-19 tests with little luck.

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee told the Washington Free Beacon that he contacted the public university after reading reports about the program, which would have encouraged the addition of “diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice” teachings to curricula at the school by offering 15 to 20 faculty members $3,000 each beginning in the spring of 2022 and ending one year later, according to an email from university officials.

“The University of Memphis informed my office that the initiative will not move forward. We welcome robust debate on college campuses, but taxpayer dollars should never be used to fuel a divisive, radical agenda,” Lee said. “Ending this program was the right decision, and I thank the university for hearing our concerns.”

Senator Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) echoed this sentiment, saying, “Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund a woke social justice agenda.”

The Daily Caller noted that information about the program, “Infusing Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Social Justice into existing Courses/Curriculum,” can still be found on the university’s website.

The program was created under the university’s “Eradicating Systemic Racism and Promoting Social Justice Initiative.”

Meanwhile, a new database of more than 500 institutions revealed that at least 236 colleges or universities have some form of mandatory student training or coursework on ideas related to critical race theory. One hundred and forty-nine schools have some form of mandatory faculty or staff training, according to CriticalRace.org.

The database, created by Cornell University law professor William A. Jacobson, found that the programs focus on concepts including “anti-racism,” “equity,” “implicit bias,” and critical race theory.

nationalreview,Economy,9848,nationalreview,"Minneapolis teachers went on strike Tuesday after failing to secure an agreement from the city to decrease class sizes, and increase pay and pandemic-related mental health resources, cancelling K–12 school for one of the largest districts in the state.

The Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, a major teachers’ union in the city, announced that they would go on strike starting Tuesday after they failed to reach an agreement in contract negotiations with the district.

“We are on strike for safe and stable schools, we’re on strike for systemic change, we’re on strike for our students, the future of our city and the future of Minneapolis public schools,” Greta Cunningham, president of the teachers’ chapter of the Minneapolis Federation of Teachers, said Tuesday during a union member picket protest, the Associated Press reported.

The district, which educates 29,000 students, promised to go back to the negotiating table until a settlement is reached.

“While it is disappointing to hear this news, we know our organizations’ mutual priorities are based on our deep commitment to the education of Minneapolis students,” the district said in a statement.

Teachers in the neighboring St. Paul School District, who had similar complaints and requests for a new contract, called off their planned strike Tuesday after they arrived at a tentative agreement Monday night. St. Paul teachers had goals to keep caps on class sizes and increase wages for teachers and lower-level education professionals as well as funding for mental-health services.

“This agreement could have been reached much earlier. It shouldn’t have taken a strike vote, but we got there,” local union president Leah VanDassor said in an announcement of the deal.

St. Paul superintendent Joe Gothard said the agreements were acceptable within the district’s budget constraints. In a statement Sunday, Gothard said the district would be amenable to maintaining current average class sizes, recruiting four more school psychologists, sending every union employee a bonus of $2,000 using federal stimulus funds, and upping the pay of the lowest-paid educational support staff, the AP noted.

“This comprehensive settlement offer addresses the union’s priorities, does not add to the projected $42 million budget shortfall next year, and most importantly, keeps our students, teachers and staff in the classroom,” he said.

The Minneapolis teacher strike comes after over two years of disrupted learning for students marked by prolonged online school and delayed in-person school reopening. It is unclear when Minneapolis students will be able to resume class.

nationalreview,Economy,9992,nationalreview,"More Americans believe inflation is the nation’s most important problem now than at any point since 1985, according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday.

Seventeen percent of Americans said rising prices are the country’s most important problem, the survey found. The figure is up from 10 percent in February and 8 percent in January.

In 1985, 18 percent of Americans said inflation was the nation’s most important issue, according to Gallup.

The renewed concern comes as inflation has hit its highest point in 40 years and gas prices have skyrocketed since Russia invaded Ukraine. Four percent of Americans cited fuel prices specifically as the greatest problem in March.

Consumer prices rose 7.9 percent in February from the year prior, the Labor Department announced this month. The increase was the largest since January 1982, which saw an 8.6 percent jump.

Meanwhile, 59 percent of respondents said they worry about cost-of-living expenses a “great deal,” the poll found.

Inflation first began rising as a public concern last fall, according to Gallup. While rising prices registered no more than 2 percent of mentions in 2021, that number jumped in October when 5 percent of Americans cited inflation as the most pressing issue.

A majority of families earning $40,000 or more (63 percent) said they are very concerned about rising costs, while 58 percent of those earning $100,000 or more said the same.

Republicans were much more concerned about inflation, with 79 percent of Republicans expressing serious concern about rising cost-of-living, while just 35 percent of Democrats said the same.

“Inflation doesn’t dominate Americans’ perceptions of the most important problem facing the country today the way it did in the early 1980s, but it’s more top-of-mind than it’s been in over three decades and appears to be taking a toll on Americans’ broader economic confidence,” Gallup said in a news release.

Sixty-eight percent of respondents cited one of several noneconomic issues as the country’s most pressing problem, including 22 percent of Americans who believe the government and poor leadership are the most important problem. Nine percent said the war in Ukraine is the most important problem.

The poll was conducted March 1-18 among 1,017 adults and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

nationalreview,Economy,9710,nationalreview,"A Pennsylvania school board voted this week to ban daily broadcasts of “CNN 10” in middle-school classrooms, according to a new report.

The Norwin School Board voted 5 to 4 on Monday to end the daily showings of the digital news program that aims to explain the “big stories of the day” in just ten minutes, according to the Norwin Star.

Banning the CNN program, which is anchored by Carl Azuz, was a key campaign promise made by three new school-board members who were voted into office last year. Under the new ruling, classroom televisions will remain off unless they are used to play commemorative broadcasts, including those focused on Veterans Day or the attack on Pearl Harbor.

While an initial resolution would have banned any television programming during the homeroom period before classes begin for the day, the board ultimately moved to allow teachers to use the TVs to show the special broadcasts.

Board member Christine Baverso made the motion after a seventh grade global-studies teacher said teachers used the televisions to show patriotic-related programming, the Norwin Star reported.

The teacher, Megan Zobb, said instructors do not want to indoctrinate students and also do not want to be micromanaged by the school board, the report adds.

Baverso said that teachers should use all sources for news on events.

Still, despite Azuz’s vow to offer a “down-the-middle explanation of world news” in the program, some parents expressed concern about allowing a biased news channel into the classroom.

Meanwhile, several teachers said they believed that the board was overstepping in prohibiting the daily broadcasts.

An eighth grade social-studies teacher said that CNN 10 “supports the school district’s mission statement of civic engagement by the students,” according to the report. CNN 10 was chosen by the district in 2019 to replace a similar news program by Channel One.

A recent episode of CNN 10 discussed crude oil, gas prices, and inflation. “Are they connected?” the program asked, according to the Washington Free Beacon.

Azuz said that inflation reached its highest level since 1982 last month and suggested the crisis in Ukraine has played a big role in the rise in prices.

“One big reason is uncertainty about the situation in Ukraine, which we discussed on yesterday’s show,” he said, adding that it “remains to be seen is whether things will stay that way or normalize in the days ahead.”

nationalreview,Economy,9483,nationalreview,"A Chinese state media outlet on Wednesday touted Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio’s endorsement of Beijing’s “common prosperity” program, a central planning initiative designed to foster economic, political, and social equity.

China Xinhua News boasted Dalio’s claim that “countries such as the U.S. could benefit from a similar approach” to common prosperity, which the financier has called “a good thing.” The network cited a Wall Street Journal report on Dalio’s support for the plan.

Dalio has urged business players in the U.S. not to overreact to China’s increasingly heavy handed approach to economic regulation, insisting that Chinese leaders are not “showing their true anticapitalist stripes” and are instead simply working to make things more equitable in the country. He has stated the importance of maintaining a market presence in the nation.

“Common prosperity is a good thing,” Dalio said at UBS Group AG’s Greater China Conference on Monday. “It’s another way of saying prosperity for most people.”

From the vantage point of many U.S. lawmakers, Beijing is using the mantle of common prosperity as an excuse to tighten its authoritarian grip on industry and the population. China has made radical economic and social interventions since, busting sectors such as e-commerce, technology, video games, and after-school tutoring for regulatory noncompliance.

Beijing has also begun to crack down more aggressively on prominent citizens who criticize the regime. Chinese billionaire Jack Ma disappeared from the public eye for months after criticizing the regime only to return to the spotlight by praising the communist party. More recently, a female tennis star who accused a CCP official of sexual assault vanished for weeks before assuring the public that she was not being held against her will in what many observers believe was a coerced hostage video.

At a meeting of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee for Financial and Economic Affairs on August 17, President Xi Jinping advocated for “common prosperity” as a means to create a more balanced and stable country in line with socialist principles. The committee subsequently proposed “reasonably adjusting excess incomes” and implored wealthy people and businesses to “give back more to society.”

Dalio said his opinion on the matter was “pretty much aligned” with Chinese leaders and that he was in favor of a gradual, mixed strategy of advancing social progress while keeping elements of entrepreneurship and innovation. Dalio’s firm has many investments in China despite the regime’s egregious record of human rights abuses.

“As Deng Xiaoping and others understood, it’s a cycle,” he said. “First you get rich, and then you make a point of distributing those opportunities in a more equal way.”

“A lot of people don’t know the true thinking, even though there have been attempts to describe it, and tend to make the mistake of thinking that this is like a return to communism under Mao, rather than understanding it’s just part of the evolutionary process,” he said.

After the communist Cultural Revolution ravaged China, Deng Xiaoping introduced market reforms to spur faster economic development. While the old system never entirely disappeared, Xiaoping’s policies made China more conducive to capitalism. However, as the economy grew over the course of many decades, so too did the inequality gap, which now serves as the impetus for common prosperity.

The U.S. “needs more common prosperity, a lot of countries do,” Dalio said at the conference, highlighting the growing income inequality gap in America.

nationalreview,Election,9511,nationalreview,"Senate minority whip John Thune (R., S.D.) said former president Trump’s spurious claims that the 2020 election was stolen will not be helpful for Republicans in the midterms, in comments to Fox News published Saturday.

“To the degree that President Trump can be helpful, can contribute to” helping Republicans take back the Senate, “we welcome that,” Thune told Fox. “But I think any time we’re talking about the 2020 election and rehashing that, it takes our eyes off the ultimate prize.”

Thune added, “We welcome the former president’s support of that, but would hope that he would play a constructive role and contribute to helping us win the majority back in 2022.”

The comments were published a week after South Dakota junior senator Mike Rounds, also a Republican, called the 2020 election “fair” in an interview on ABC’s This Week, prompting backlash from Trump.

“Is he crazy or just stupid?” Trump said of Rounds in a statement.

Regarding criticism Rounds received for acknowledging the results of the election, Thune commented, “I say to my colleague, ‘Welcome to the club.’” Thune received backlash in December of 2020 when he said an effort to block certification of the election results was “going down like a shot dog.”

Thune announced on January 8th that he will be seeking a fourth term in the Senate this year, and Thune told Punchbowl News he is “interested” in taking Mitch McConnell’s (R., Ky.) place as the top Senate Republican.

“Obviously, nobody knows when [McConnell] is departing and we all hope he stays. But obviously it’s something I’m interested in,” Thune said.

nationalreview,Election,9533,nationalreview,"Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin tapped prominent anti-critical race theory activist Angela Sailor as the state’s new director of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

“The people of Virginia elected the most diverse leadership in the Commonwealth’s history. Virginia is big enough for the hopes and dreams of a diverse people. Angela Sailor’s experience in government, nonprofits and the private sector will guide us as we ensure that the government is working for all Virginians across our diverse Commonwealth, especially when it comes to economic opportunity for all Virginians,” Youngkin said.

In appointing her to the position, Youngkin also issued an executive order that will reorient the office away from realizing racialized equality-of-outcome objectives. Instead, the office will focus on creating economic opportunity for disadvantaged Virginians, enforcing “free speech and civil discourse” in academia, and ensuring that students receive an “honest, objective, and complete” civic education,” Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

The governor also announced that he would introduce legislation to change the word “equity” in the office’s name to “opportunity.”

Without specifying racial background, the executive order reads: “…too many of our citizens have not received the equal opportunity they deserve, and we recognize that diversity when genuinely embraced strengthens our Commonwealth.”

Sailor’s resume includes experiences in government, the corporate world, and the political think tank realm. She has served as vice president of the Heritage Foundation’s Feulner Institute, director of African American Affairs for former President George W. Bush’s presidential campaign, and deputy chief of staff for former U.S. Education Secretary Rod Paige, among others.

Sailor has expressed views in the line with Youngkin’s promise to curb the teaching of critical race theory in Virginia public schools, which he did as one of his first orders of business upon assuming office last weekend. His office said he signed an executive order that “delivers on his Day One promise to restore excellence in education by ending the use of divisive concepts, including Critical Race Theory, in public education.”

Sailor has written multiple pieces for the Heritage Foundation arguing that critical race theory is harmful to children, applauding the work of the 1776 commission, the advisory committee established by former President Trump to foster a “patriotic education,” and stating the important role parents play in education. Youngkin made parent participation in education a hallmark of his campaign platform.

“People have the freedom to use CRT as a weapon to cast hate. Or we can use core civic knowledge as an opportunity to reset, understand our common political inheritance, and build a stronger community with our children,” she said in an article titled “Most Parents and Teachers Are Done With Critical Race Theory.”

In another piece, she claimed that the progressive buzzwords “diversity” and “inclusion” act as a shroud to conceal what is actually critical race theory, a narrow lens of American history that treats racism as its founding and integral flaw.

“No one would argue that children shouldn’t be thoroughly taught about the evils of racism, slavery, and segregation that happened in this country,” she wrote in July. “But [critical race theory] ignores the hundreds of thousands of lives that were sacrificed during the Civil War to end slavery, the long struggle of the civil rights movement to end segregation and win equality, and the reality that the nation has made great progress.”

nationalreview,Election,9530,nationalreview,"Despite the resistance he’s faced from his party over his opposition to reforming the legislative filibuster through unconventional avenues, moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said he won’t be surrendering his long-held position.

Ahead of a Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday evening, Manchin told the press that he will refuse to support a return to the “talking filibuster,” which would nix the 60-vote threshold needed to advance legislation through the Senate, allowing Democrats to move their voting package across the finish line.

The “talking filibuster” is an old-fashioned style for the rule requiring at least one member of the minority to command the Senate floor to maintain the filibuster. Democrats shifted strategy to resurrecting the “talking filibuster” after their last pitch to allow a “carve-out” for the voting bill, exempting it from the 60-vote hurdle, failed last week.

While Manchin has been amenable to revising the filibuster, but not outright abolishing it, he rejected the Democrats’ idea of using a simple majority vote to do so, otherwise known as the “nuclear option,” which has scarcely been exercised and Republicans fear is a slippery slope to an overhaul of the legislative process. Ordinarily, a rule change for legislative procedure requires two-thirds of members present and voting.

Manchin seemed unfazed by suggestions of a primary challenge over what fellow Democrats are calling obstruction on his part, noting that he’s never faltered on his pro-filibuster stance. “I’ve been primaried my entire life. That would not be anything new for me,” he said.

While his Democratic colleagues, most notably Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, have flip-flopped on the filibuster when it was politically advantageous, Manchin said he’s always been consistent.

“The majority of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus have changed their minds. I respect that. They have a right to change their minds. I haven’t. I hope they respect that too. I’ve never changed my mind on the filibuster,” he added.

Despite the fact that Manchin and his centrist counterpart Kyrsten Sinema are crucial to advancing Democratic policy priorities, as they hold the swing votes, the party has resorted to antagonizing the pair for their inflexibility. Manchin said “he doesn’t take anything personally,” as Schumer declared Tuesday that the chamber will end debate Wednesday and proceed with the nuclear option despite insufficient votes.

“If Republicans choose to continue the filibuster of voting rights legislation, we must consider and vote on the rules changes,” Schumer said. “Long odds are no excuse for this chamber to avoid this important issue. Again, members of this chamber were elected to debate and to vote. We’re going to vote.”

Without Manchin and Sinema’s acquiescence to change the filibuster, however, the Democrats’ voting legislation is all but guaranteed to fail.

nationalreview,Election,9976,nationalreview,"A federal judge in California said Monday that President Donald Trump “more likely than not” committed a felony by attempting to obstruct Congress as part of a scheme to overturn the 2020 election.

The judge’s decision bolsters the case of the January 6 committee probing the Capitol riot, in which a mob of Trump supporters stormed the premises in an attempt to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election results for Joe Biden. The investigative House panel has accused Trump of inciting the attack and has been considering making a criminal referral to the Justice Department.

“The illegality of the plan was obvious,” wrote Judge David O. Carter of the Central District of California. “Our nation was founded on the peaceful transition of power, epitomized by George Washington laying down his sword to make way for democratic elections. Ignoring this history, President Trump vigorously campaigned for the vice president to single-handedly determine the results of the 2020 election.”

The judge also issued an order for John Eastman — a lawyer who authored a memo that some members of Congress have suggested was a plan for former vice president Pence to invalidate the 2020 election — to turn over more than 100 emails to the committee.

Such documents likely detail the six-step plan pitched by Eastman to convince Pence that there was a legal, Constitutional route by which he could refuse to certify electors from several key swing states when the electoral counting process commenced on January 6. Eastman had already sued the committee to stop the court from compelling him to submit the emails, citing attorney-client privilege.

“The true animating force behind these emails was advancing a political strategy: to persuade Vice President Pence to take unilateral action on January 6,” Judge Carter wrote.

The committee has rejected Eastman’s privilege appeal, claiming that such an exception is not applicable in the case that the documents were used to advance a criminal plot. Members have argued that they have amassed enough ammunition to prove that Trump, Eastman, and other associated likely committed crimes relating to obstructing congressional procedure and conspiring to defraud the American public.

Carter decided Monday that it was “likely” that Trump and Eastman met both of these prongs, and “dishonestly conspired to obstruct the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.” He claimed that Trump knew there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud and yet pushed Pence to pursue the backdoor route to secure him the final victory anyway.

“President Trump and Dr. Eastman justified the plan with allegations of election fraud,” he said, “but President Trump likely knew the justification was baseless, and therefore that the entire plan was unlawful.”

nationalreview,Election,9925,nationalreview,"Two Republican candidates for U.S. Senate in Ohio had a heated exchange during a primary debate on Friday, with the pair arguing in each other’s faces until a moderator pulled them apart.

The incident between candidates Josh Mandel and Mike Gibbons began with Mandel saying Gibbons had “made millions” from business dealings with Chinese companies.

Gibbons then said Mandel has never worked in the private sector, causing Mandel to rise from his seat and get in Gibbon’s face during the primary forum hosted by FreedomWorks outside of Columbus.

“Two tours in Iraq, don’t tell me I haven’t worked!” Mandel replied.

A moderator ultimately steps in to pull the two apart.

After the debate, a spokesperson for Gibbons said Mandel “is unhinged, unfit and flailing — because he’s losing.”

“He is only a professional at one thing: running for office,” said spokeswoman Samantha Cotten. “He is hellbent on lying because he is failing. He doesn’t have the temperament, experience, or fortitude to be a U.S. senator and Ohio voters got a firsthand look at just how unprepared Josh Mandel is to be a leader and that will be reflected at the ballot on May 3.”

Meanwhile, Mandel’s campaign manager said Gibbons “got upset tonight that he was called out for his investments in Chinese oil.”

“He claims not to remember the investment, but it’s part of a pattern of Gibbons’ entire career making money by taking American companies and selling them to foreign interests,” campaign manager Scott Guthrie said. “While Ohioans are struggling to make ends meet in Joe Biden’s America, Mike Gibbons spent his entire career profiting by shipping jobs overseas and investing in places like China and Russia.”

A Fox News poll earlier this month found Gibbons, an investment banker from the Cleveland area, and Mandel, a former state treasurer, are leading among seven candidates on the ballot in the Republican primary. Gibbons had the backing of 22 percent of voters, while Mandel had the support of 20 percent of voters, the poll found.

Other Republican candidates in the race to replace retiring Senator Rob Portman include Ohio state Senator Matt Dolan, former state GOP chair Jane Timken and venture capitalist J.D. Vance. The primary is currently scheduled for May 3, but could be pushed back because of court challenges to the state’s redistricting plans.

Meanwhile, the Ohio Democratic Party released a statement calling the Republican senate primary race a “cavalcade of clowns” after Friday night’s debate.

“We encourage every voter to watch this forum and see for themselves why these Republicans do not deserve to be in the United States Senate,” spokesperson Michael Beyer said.

nationalreview,Election,9708,nationalreview,"Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton again on Thursday repudiated as a phony scandal the recent revelation that operatives connected to her campaign allegedly spied on the Trump administration as part of an effort to cook up a Russia-collusion narrative.

During her keynote speech for the 2022 New York State Democratic Convention, Clinton said Durham’s findings are a “right-wing lie” meant to serve as a distraction from Trump’s own scandals.

“And we can’t get distracted. Whether it’s by the latest culture war nonsense or some new right-wing lie on Fox or Facebook. By the way, they’ve been coming after me again in case you might have noticed. It’s funny, the more trouble Trump gets into the wilder the charges and conspiracy theories about me seem to get,” she said.

“So now his accountants have fired him and investigations draw closer to him and right on cue the noise machine gets turned up…” she added. “Fox leads the charge against me, counting on their audience to fall for it again. They’re getting awfully close to actual malice in their attacks.”

Special counsel John Durham is currently trying to get to the bottom of the extensive Trump/Russia probe launched by the Obama administration that spanned into the Trump administration, consuming the press and public for two years.

In a court filing last week, Durham claimed that a technology executive “exploited his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data” to extract contacts between Moscow and facilities tied to Trump. Those facilities included Trump Tower, Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and the executive office of the presidency, after Trump had already been inaugurated, according to the court filing.

Durham’s filing only identified the person as “Tech Executive-1,” the Washington Examiner reported. However, previous reporting by CNN indicated that that individual is Rodney Joffe, a senior vice president at Neustar who was also a client of Michael Sussmann, a partner at Perkins Coie, the high-powered law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party.

Durham had previously indicted Sussmann for lying to the FBI to obscure his association with the Clinton campaign. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.

Durham alleges that the unnamed tech executive delivered the data he collected to Sussmann, who then allegedly brought it to the FBI and the CIA alleging an improper connection between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Durham also noted that the unnamed technology executive worked with an investigative firm that Perkins Coie hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The executive abused his company’s “sensitive arrangement” to provide services to the executive office of the president “for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,” Durham reportedly alleged.

Since Durham’s bombshell dropped, Trump released statements accusing Clinton of orchestrating an “espionage campaign on his New York City apartment.”

“The latest pleading from Special Counsel Robert [sic] Durham provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia,” Trump said in an email statement.

“This is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate and those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution,” he added.

nationalreview,Election,9580,nationalreview,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said Tuesday she plans to run for reelection this year.

“While we have made progress much more needs to be done to improve people’s lives. This election is crucial: nothing less is at stake than our Democracy,” the 81-year-old Democrat said in a tweet.

Pelosi, who has led her party in the chamber since 2003, narrowly won reelection as Speaker in a 216–209 vote in January 2021. Her current term, which is her fourth as speaker, is expected to be her last as she said in 2018 that she would seek a fourth and final term only if she had the support of two-thirds of her caucus.

At the time, she noted there had been a move to place limits on the leadership and the chairs of committees and that she planned to abide by the limits whether they were put in place or not.

Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who currently serves as the House Democratic Caucus chairman, is internally considered the favorite to succeed Pelosi as the leader of the House Democrats, according to The Hill.

Now, many are wondering whether Pelosi will go back on her word and seek to retain her leadership spot if Democrats hold on to their majority this year.

Meanwhile, the future of Democrats’ majority in the House is in question as the GOP needs a net gain of just five seats in the 2022 midterms to regain control of the chamber after losing the majority in the 2018 midterms for the first time in eight years.

On Tuesday, Pelosi reiterated her commitment to fighting for her party’s agenda despite a series of recent failures, including the inability to pass President Biden’s Build Back Better plan or the party’s voting rights legislation.

“Our democracy is at risk because of assaults on the truth . . . and the state-by-state assault on voting rights,” Pelosi said. “This election is crucial. Nothing less is at stake than our Democracy . . . and that is why I am running for reelection to Congress.”

nationalreview,Election,9906,nationalreview,"A narrow majority of U.S. voters support Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Bill, which prohibits the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity to public school students in kindergarten through third grade.

Fifty-one percent of those polled approve of the measure while 35 percent oppose it, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll of registered voters.

“Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards,” the bill reads.

Pertaining to the second half of that provision, 52 percent of respondents also agreed with making sure sexuality and gender discussion after third grade is “age appropriate.” The bill empowers parents to sue school districts they believe to be violating the law by offering curricula on LGBT topics before third grade, an enforcement mechanism that only 41 percent of those polled support while 43 percent oppose.

Public opinion on the bill fell along partisan lines, with 70 percent of Republican voters backing Florida’s legislation and 51 percent of Democrats rejecting it. Independents helped shift the balance with 46 percent supporting it and 35 percent opposing it.

Progressives at the state and national level have decried the initiative and dubbed it the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, despite the fact that such language is missing from the text. That language was also used in the poll questions.

The legislation caused an uproar among Disney employees, who pressured CEO Bob Chapek to release a statement of solidarity with the LGBTQ community and demand that Governor Ron DeSantis rescind the measure. When DeSantis refused to acquiesce after a phone call with Chapek, who voiced his concerns with the bill, Disney announced it would be suspending political donations in the state pending a review. DeSantis subsequently crafted an ad showcasing his opposition to Disney.

While DeSantis did not propose the Parental Rights in Education bill, he has been a staunch advocate. “As the parent of three kids that are age 5 and under, thank you for letting me and my wife be able to send our kids to kindergarten without them being sexualized,” he said at a press conference this week.

Florida’s bill comes amid heightened parental awareness in the state and others with similar political makeup over classroom curricula in K-12 public schools, especially relating to radically progressive pedagogy such as gender ideology and critical race theory. Florida has blazed the trail on social issues since the pandemic began, using the Republican dominated state legislature and governorship to advance conservative policy goals, including bans on critical race theory, transgender athletes in women’s sports, and now sexual education for elementary schoolers.

nationalreview,Election,9508,nationalreview,"DirecTV has decided not to renew its contract with the far-right One America News Network (OANN), according to several reports.

The DirecTV broadcast satellite service, which is owned by AT&T Inc. and TPG Inc., said in a statement that it has informed Herring Networks, the owner of OANN, that “following a routine internal review,” DirecTV does not “plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires.”

One source told Bloomberg News. which first reported the decision, that the contract is set to expire in early April.

DirecTV is currently the largest distributor of OANN. The network will still air on Verizon Fios and other smaller carriers. It is also available to stream online from KloudTV.

In October, the NAACP met with AT&T to encourage the company to drop OANN.

Dominion Voting Systems, an elections-equipment manufacturer, filed a lawsuit against the owner of OANN and against the conservative news service Newsmax in August, seeking roughly $1.6 billion in defamation damages after both helped peddle several election-related conspiracy theories on behalf of then-president Donald Trump.

In one of the most egregious examples of the falsehoods spread by the networks, according to Dominion, an “expert mathematician” interviewed on OANN was actually an installer at a Long Island swing-set-construction company.

In February, OANN was forced to air a 90-second disclaimer before it showed a three-hour movie by MyPillow founder and Trump ally Mike Lindell that featured election-related conspiracy theories.

In November, another voting-technology company, Smartmatic, filed separate defamation lawsuits against Newsmax and OANN for airing similar disinformation about its products. The suits accuse both media outlets of falsely stating that Smartmatic “rigged” the presidential election for President Biden in key swing states.

nationalreview,Election,9482,nationalreview,"Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) tore into President Biden’s speech advocating a suspension of filibuster rules, in remarks on the Senate floor on Wednesday.

“The president’s rant — rant — yesterday was incoherent, incorrect, and beneath his office,” McConnell said.

Biden gave a speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Tuesday in an attempt to drum up support for suspending filibuster rules in order to pass voting legislation. McConnell blasted the speech as a demagogic attempt to cast Republicans as racists over their opposition to federalizing elections.

“The president repeatedly invoked the January 6th riot while himself using irresponsible, delegitimizing rhetoric that undermines our democracy,” McConnell continued. “The sitting president of the United States compared American states to totalitarian states. . . . So the world saw our commander-in-chief propagandize against his own country to a degree that would have made Pravda blush.”

McConnell decried Biden’s rhetoric as painting millions of voters and a majority of the Senate as “racist.”

“A president shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants is proving exactly why the Framers built the Senate to check his power,” McConnell said. “This whole display is the best possible argument for preserving the Senate rules that extend deliberation, force bipartisan compromise, and let cooler heads prevail.”

Biden compared opponents of Democrats’ voting legislation to southern segregationists in his Tuesday speech, asking, “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?”

One of the bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would restore portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required districts with a history of discrimination to obtain approval from the Justice Department before changing voting rules.

A second bill, the Freedom to Vote Act, would set a 15-day minimum early voting period, set national voter-ID standards that would include a range of documentation, make it easier for residents to sue states over redistricting issues, and make Election Day a federal holiday.

nationalreview,Election,9499,nationalreview,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday claimed President Biden was not comparing opponents of Democrats’ voting bill to racists and segregationists as “humans,” explaining that he was just comparing their “choice” to oppose the legislation during his speech in Atlanta earlier this week.

“So I ask every elected official in America, how do you want to be remembered?” Biden said during his speech advocating a suspension of filibuster rules to pass voting legislation. “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace? Do you want to be on the side of John Lewis or Bull Connor? Do you want to be on the side of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis?”

Psaki said Friday: “I think everybody listening to that speech who’s speaking on the level, as my mother would say, would note that he was not comparing them as humans; he was comparing the choice to those figures in history and where they’re going to position themselves as they determine whether they’re going to support the fundamental right to vote or not.”

Psaki dismissed Republican criticism of the speech earlier in the week, saying “claims about the offensive nature of the speech” are “hilarious on many levels given how many people sat silently over the last four years for the former president.”

“Look, I’ve known, liked and personally respected Joe Biden for many years. I did not recognize the man at the podium yesterday,” McConnell said.

The Senate minority leader panned Biden for bringing up the Civil War “to demonize Americans who disagree with him” and noted that the president likened “a bipartisan majority of senators to literal traitors.”

Even Democratic senator Dick Durbin of Illinois acknowledged on Wednesday that Biden might have gone “a little too far in his rhetoric.”

Biden’s speech on Tuesday attempted to gin up support for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. The former would federalize some facets of elections, including setting a 15-day minimum early-voting period and setting national standards for voter-ID laws to include a range of documentation. The latter would restore portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that allowed the Justice Department to review election-rule changes in districts with a history of discrimination.

“While we take no pleasure in this announcement, the ADP Executive Board has decided to formally censure Senator Sinema as a result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy,” ADP chair Raquel Terán said in a statement.

“In the choice between an archaic legislative norm and protecting Arizonans’ right to vote, we choose the latter, and we always will,” Terán said.

Sinema spokeswoman Hannah Hurley said the senator has long supported the filibuster, in a statement to the media.

“During three terms in the U.S. House, and now in the Senate, Kyrsten has always promised Arizonans she would be an independent voice for the state — not for either political party,” Hurley said. “She’s delivered for Arizonans and has always been honest about where she stands.”

The vote in favor of censuring Sinema was unanimous, according to AZCentral. While a censure is purely symbolic, the move is the latest in a series of rebukes from Democratic officials and donors. Representative Jamaal Bowman (D., N.Y.) referred to Sinema last week as a “traitor,” while Mondaire Jones (D., N.Y.) deemed Sinema, Senator Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), and Republican senators “white nationalists.”

Senate Democrats failed to pass two voting bills on Wednesday evening, and failed to change filibuster rules in another attempt to pass the legislation due to opposition from Sinema and Manchin (D., W.Va.).

nationalreview,Immigration,9713,nationalreview,"American-born skier Eileen Gu defended her decision to compete for China at the Beijing Olympics despite China’s human rights abuses on Thursday, saying she is “not trying to solve political problems right now.”

“People sometimes don’t know what to do with other people when they’re not fitting in a box,” she told reporters after the qualifying round in the ski halfpipe. “They say, ‘Is she Chinese? Is she American? Is she a model? Is she a student? Why is she trying to change the world when she’s only 18?’”

Gu, who won gold in the women’s freestyle and silver in the women’s slopestyle, was born in San Francisco but has chosen to compete for China, her mother’s native country. The decision has drawn criticism from many Americans who say it is unconscionable to represent China, given the country’s various human rights abuses, including the ongoing genocide it’s prosecuting against Uyghur Muslims.

Gu has avoided questions about her citizenship since winning gold; China does not allow dual citizenship, raising questions over whether the 18-year-old relinquished her American citizenship to compete for China. Chinese state media has reported that Gu became a Chinese national three years ago.

While announcing her decision in 2019, Gu professed to be “proud of [her] heritage, and equally proud of [her] American upbringings.” She added that the “opportunity to help inspire millions of young people where my mom was born, during the 2022 Beijing Olympic Winter Games is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love.”

Gu has said she has spent at least a quarter of her life in China and has said her hope is to get more girls and women to participate in winter sports. China also aims to inspire 300 million to participate in winter sports.

“My biggest goal is for some girl to be sitting at home watching freeskiing for the first time and thinking, ‘maybe that could be me some day.’ Maybe she sees someone who looks like her doing it and thinks, ‘Hey, I can do that, too,'” Gu said.

Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has criticized the 18-year-old skier, accusing her of “standing for human rights abuses.”

“In terms of the citizenship, look, China or the U.S.? You have got to pick a side. Period,” asserted Haley in an interview with Real Clear Politics. “You’ve got to pick a side because you’re either American or you’re Chinese, and they are two very different countries… Every athlete needs to know when they put their flag on, you’re standing for freedom or you’re standing for human rights abuses.

nationalreview,Immigration,9656,nationalreview,"Eileen Gu, the 18-year-old freestyle skier from California who chose to represent China at the Olympic Games in Beijing, won gold for a daring experimental trick jump on Tuesday.

Stuck in third place with one last jump to finish her event, Gu performed a bold Left Double 1620 with a safety grab, for the first time in her career, garnering a surplus of points and securing first place. Fans applauded her with Chinese flags.

“I was hoping that it wouldn’t have to come to that, but it did,” Gu told the New York Times. “Honestly, I’m really glad that it did, because I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to try it.”

Gu’s mother grew up in China and then emigrated to San Francisco, where she raised Gu in an affluent neighborhood.

While Gu is American, Chinese brands and media have promoted her extensively in advertisements and news. The Chinese internet erupted in praise and fanfare for Gu’s victory, with Sina Weibo, the social network comparable to Twitter, crashing for a short time as its servers overloaded, Chinese media say. Gu was the subject of five of the ten trending topics on the platform. Weibo is assumed to be closely censored and monitored by Chinese authorities.

“Freestyle ski star Gu Ailing a super idol among Chinese young people for representing true spirit of sport,” the headline of an article in Chinese news outlet Global Times read Thursday, referring to the athlete’s Chinese name, Reuters reported.

Gu’s placement in the front row among the Chinese athletic delegation at the opening ceremony, as well as her decision to eat dumplings in Beijing, have also generated a lot of positive attention on Chinese social media.

While Gu’s teammate, figure skater Zhu Yi, another U.S.-born athlete forfeited her U.S. citizenship in order to represent China in Beijing, it’s unclear whether Gu has also technically discarded her American citizenship, given that China does not allow dual-citizenship.

“Most British-Chinese keep their PRC passports, but they are very careful and scared of being caught because their (PRC) passports would be cut up… The dignity of the law compared to Winter Olympic gold, which is more precious?” a user called Tomson wrote on Weibo.

“Who cares whether she is a dual national or not!,” another user mynameisliuxiaohun wrote. “Regardless she is coming out to represent China, she is carrying the Chinese flag! The glory she gets is China’s, who else? Isn’t this good?”

While Gu and her mother have agreed to stay out of the geopolitical quagmire, the champion’s decision to switch sporting allegiances has earned her some backlash in the United States. Gu told the Times she wants to help facilitate better relations between the nations, while boosting China’s developing winter sports arena, but that is a difficult feat in what is an increasingly political charged conversation.

Given the venue in Beijing, the seat of government of the Chinese Communist Party, which has been perpetrated human rights abuses against the Uyghur minority, Hong Kong pro-democracy dissenters, and Tibetans, Gu’s allegiance has raised eyebrows in America.

nationalreview,Immigration,9969,nationalreview,"President Biden said Russian president Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power” in a speech on the invasion of Ukraine on Saturday.

“Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia. For free people refuse to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness,” Biden said at the end of a speech at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland. They “have a different future, a brighter future, rooted in democracy and principle, hope and light, of decency and dignity and freedom and possibilities.”

Then Biden added, “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power.”

A White House official issued a comment minutes later saying that Biden was not calling for regime change.

“The President’s point was Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region. He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change,” the official said.

Earlier in the address, Biden repeated a pledge to defend NATO allies. While Ukraine is not a member of the NATO alliance, Poland and the Baltic states on Russia’s border are members.

“Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory,” Biden said. “We have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory.”

Biden made his remarks after meeting with Ukrainian refugees and holding discussions with Ukrainian officials and Poland’s president Andrzej Duda.

During Biden’s visit, the city of Lviv in western Ukraine was targeted in an apparent missile strike. Lviv sits near the border with Poland and has been largely spared from fighting since the war began. While there were no confirmed casualties in the strikes, CNN reported that one strike hit a fuel storage facility, causing it to burst into flames.

nationalreview,Immigration,9682,nationalreview,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv will relocate to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine, as a result of the buildup of Russian military forces on Ukraine’s borders.

“My team and I constantly review the security situation to determine when prudence dictates a change in posture,” Blinken said in a statement on the State Department website. “With that in mind, we are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces.”

“I have ordered these measures for one reason — the safety of our staff — and we strongly urge any remaining U.S. citizens in Ukraine to leave the country immediately,” added Blinken.

The State Department has also ordered the dismantling of computer workstations and of the Kyiv embassy’s phone network, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing internal communications and U.S. officials familiar with the orders.

Russia has amassed roughly 130,000 troops at the Ukrainian border, including in Ukraine’s northern neighbor Belarus. It remains unclear whether Russian president Vladimir Putin will give the order to invade Ukraine, with Russian officials denying that an invasion is imminent.

Russia has objected to the proposed membership of Ukraine in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with Putin voicing concerns about NATO’s military presence on Russia’s borders.

“Our recent warnings have indeed been heard and are having a certain effect: Tensions have risen there, after all,” Putin said in a speech to Russian diplomats in November. “It is important for them to remain in this state for as long as possible, so that it does not occur to them to stage some kind of conflict on our western frontiers that we do not need.”

nationalreview,Immigration,9806,nationalreview,"President Biden celebrated Ukrainian resilience in the midst of the ongoing Russian invasion in his first State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, and touted his own role in uniting the West in its response to the Kremlin’s unprovoked aggression.

The invasion, which began on February 24, has caused over 660,000 people to flee the country, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The U.N. said 136 civilians, including 13 children, have been killed in six days of war.

Russian president Vladimir Putin sought to justify his invasion by claiming he would “denazify” Ukraine, while Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday that Russia “is preventing Nazis and those who push methods of genocide to rule in this country.”

Biden countered on Tuesday that Putin did not anticipate the resistance he would meet in Ukraine.

“He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined. He met the Ukrainian people,” Biden said.

“Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and totally unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. He thought he could divide us here at home,” Biden said. “But Putin was wrong. We are ready, we are united, and that’s what we did — we stayed united.”

Biden and European leaders have announced various sanctions targeting the Russian economy, and on Tuesday Biden said the U.S. would follow Europeans nations by banning Russian aircraft from its airspace. The president also said he spent “countless hours unifying our European allies,” disseminating Putin’s plans in advance of the invasion.

Moving to the nation’s economic situation, Biden touted the passage of the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.

“We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks. We’re now talking about an infrastructure decade,” Biden said. “It’s going to transform America, to put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world, particularly China.”

Biden said the infrastructure and jobs created as a result of the bill will help ensure that American goods are “made in America.”

Biden also claimed already to see a “revitalization” of American manufacturing, with “369,000 new manufacturing jobs created in America last year alone,” though he didn’t acknowledge the massive lift his economy received from the cessation of Covid lockdowns.

However, Biden noted, the economic recovery following the Covid pandemic and resultant supply-chain issues have pushed costs up and driven inflation. The consumer price index rose 7.4 percent over the twelve months ending in January, the highest annual increase in inflation since February 1982, while wholesale prices rose 9.7 percent in January from the previous year.

Biden touted a plan to fight inflation, promising Americans to “lower your costs, not your wages.”

“Make more cars and semiconductors in America. More infrastructure and innovation in America,” Biden said. “More goods moving faster and cheaper in America. More jobs where you can earn a good living in America. Instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.”

Rather than seeking to cool off an overheated economy, Biden pledged additional government spending to fight inflation, advocating additional methods to cut costs, included tax credits and investments in clean energy including solar, wind, and electric-powered vehicles, as well as subsidized child care. Meanwhile, Biden called for a 15-percent minimum tax for corporations and touted efforts to establish a global minimum tax.

Biden said part of his plan to combat inflation includes lowering the cost of prescription drugs.

“Let’s let Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs,” Biden said.

Turning to the Covid pandemic, Biden noted that more areas of the country are moving back to “normal routines,” with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxing mask guidelines for the U.S. Additionally, Biden called for schools to remain open for in-person learning.

“Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school,” Biden said.

Biden also sought to reassure Americans that vaccines for new Covid variants, should they arise, can be deployed efficiently.

“If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years,” Biden said. “I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.”

The Biden administration faced record high levels of illegal immigration during the president’s first year in office, with Border Patrol officers encountering roughly 1.9 million migrants at the southern border.

Biden sought to allay concerns over the influx of migrants over the past year. The president touted the installation of “new technology” at the border to “better detect drug smuggling,” and joint patrols with Mexico and, further south, Guatemala, to catch “human traffickers.”

Additionally, Biden said his administration is putting in place “dedicated immigration judges in significant larger number” to ease pressure for asylum cases.

nationalreview,Immigration,9971,nationalreview,"President Biden compared the influx of Ukrainian refugees in Poland to the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border in comments during a meeting with Polish president Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Saturday.

Poland has absorbed over 2.2 million Ukrainian refugees since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine at the end of February. Biden called on other NATO allies to receive more refugees fleeing from the war.

“We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on a significant responsibility that I don’t think should just be Poland, it should be the whole world—all of NATO’s responsibility. The fact that you have so many Ukrainians seeking refuge in this country of Poland, we understand that because we have on our southern border thousands of people a day—literally, not figuratively—trying to get to the United States,” Biden said at a bilateral meeting with Duda.

Biden added that his administration believes it should “do our part relative to Ukraine as well by opening our borders to another 100,000 people,” apparently referencing a decision to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees under temporary protected status.

U.S. border agents encountered over 2 million migrants at the southern border during President Biden’s first year in office. The influx saw record-breaking monthly totals, with a high of 213,593 encounters recorded in July 2021.

The U.S. border crisis is ongoing with 164,973 migrant encounters reported in February, up over 60 percent from February 2021. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement report released in March showed that ICE arrests and deportations dropped after the president assumed office.

nationalreview,Immigration,9991,nationalreview,"The Republican National Committee has launched a new video series to draw attention to the crisis at the southern border one month after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents apprehended more than 164,000 illegal immigrants at the border, the highest total for February in 22 years.

The first video of the new series, Unchecked, was released Wednesday and features interviews with Senator Ted Cruz (R., Texas), Representative Tony Gonzalez (R., Texas), former Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Ron Vitiello and journalist Julio Rosas.

CBP agents apprehended more than 2 million migrants at the southern border during President Joe Biden’s first year in office, likely the highest number in over 20 years, according to a National Review analysis of CBP data.

In the new video, Vitiello said, “We’ve never seen a number that big, we’ve never seen two million encounters within a year’s time, it’s just never happened. The people that live just north of the border – they see the human trafficking, they see the exploitation, they see the smuggling, and so [Americans] are most effected by it day to day.”

Meanwhile, Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz told CNN last week that he is anticipating a record-breaking surge in migrants crossing the border this spring. He told the outlet as many as 8,000 people could be apprehended daily, doubling the daily number of the 2019 surge under the Trump administration.

The record-breaking figure “will probably become the norm over the next 30 to 45 days,” Ortiz said.

Still, the Biden administration is reportedly set to end the use of Title 42, a Trump-era public health order that has allowed U.S. border officials to quickly expel migrant families to Mexico, in the coming days.

A senior official from the Department of Homeland Security warned as many as 18,000 migrants per day could flood the southern border if Title 42 is revoked.

DHS officials told reporters they have “no idea” when Title 42 will be lifted, though the CDC is currently conducting a review of the policy, which must be finished by March 30, according to ABC News. An announcement on whether it will be renewed could come shortly after.

In the newly released RNC video, Cruz called the situation at the border a “human rights catastrophe.”

“We are seeing a public health catastrophe, we are seeing a crime and national security catastrophe … I’ve asked the Senate Democrats to Texas and see the border, not one of them is willing to do it,” Cruz said. “They are literally turning a blind eye, and they are counting on the corporate media to cover it up.”

RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement announcing the video series that Biden is the “root cause of the pain and suffering on the border.”

“Biden and ‘border czar’ Kamala Harris’ failures have put our law enforcement officials in harm’s way, leaving them to defend an open border with drugs, human trafficking, and crime surging,” she said. “Every community is a border community under Biden, as drugs and crime move across the country.”

nationalreview,Immigration,9663,nationalreview,"Two watchdog groups are suing the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services for records of communications with Catholic organizations involved in aiding migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.

CatholicVote Civic Action and Judicial Watch filed the lawsuit on Wednesday, Judicial Watch announced in a press release, after DHS and HHS failed to respond Freedom of Information Act requests made in September.

The FOIA requests were for communications between U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, the Humanitarian Respite Center in McAllen, Texas, and the Diocese of Brownsville.

“The Biden administration has refused to provide copies of communications between Catholic-affiliated charities and organizations at the border,” CatholicVote president Brian Burch said in a statement.

“American Catholics deserve to know the full extent of the U.S. government’s role in funding and coordinating with Catholic church affiliated agencies at the border, and what role these agencies played in the record surge of illegal immigrants over the past year,” Burch added.

CCRGV operated its Humanitarian Respite Center to aid migrants who crossed the southern border into the U.S. last summer. Sister Norma Pimentel, CCRGV’s Executive Director, stated in an interview with journalist Ali Bradley on February 3 that the organization is reimbursed with “taxpayer’s money” for some of their efforts.

The La Joya Police Department in southern Texas announced in late July that an officer encountered a migrant family with Covid at a local Whataburger. The family told the officer that CCRGV was paying a local hotel for their room, and the officer eventually discovered that CCRGV had booked all the rooms in the hotel for Covid-positive migrants without informing the police department.

CCRGV said the incident of the family leaving isolation was an “isolated case” in a comment to a local CBS affiliate at the time.

Border Patrol agents encountered about 2 million migrants during 2021, likely the highest amount in 20 years. During the 2020-2021 fiscal year, border agents detained roughly 1.66 million migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the highest level ever recorded.

nationalreview,Immigration,9675,nationalreview,"President Biden and Russian president Vladimir Putin held an hour-long phone call on Saturday amid fears that Russia will invade Ukraine in the near future.

Biden “was clear that, if Russia undertakes a further invasion of Ukraine, the United States together with our Allies and partners will respond decisively and impose swift and severe costs on Russia,” a White House readout of the call stated. Biden further “reiterated that a further Russian invasion of Ukraine would produce widespread human suffering and diminish Russia’s standing.”

However, a senior White House official told reporters that Russia may still commence an invasion.

“There was no fundamental change in the dynamic that has been unfolding now for several weeks,” the official said. While Biden and Putin agreed to remain in communication, “Russia may decide to proceed with military action anyway.”

Russia has moved about 130,000 troops to the Ukrainian border in recent weeks and has stationed missile batteries and fighter jets in Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north. Russian officials have denied any intent to invade Ukraine.

The Biden-Putin call came hours after the U.S. State Department announced it had ordered the evacuation of most employees in the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.

“On February 12, 2022, the Department of State ordered the departure of most U.S. direct hire employees from Embassy Kyiv due to the continued threat of Russian military action,” the agency said in a travel advisory.

“As of Sunday, February 13, 2022, the Department of State will suspend consular services at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv,” the advisory added. “The Embassy will maintain a small consular presence in Lviv, Ukraine to handle emergencies, but will not be able to provide passport, visa or routine consular services.”

Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby also announced on Saturday that the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered Florida National Guard troops out of Ukraine. Those troops were stationed in Ukraine to help train and advise the the Ukrainian army.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy cautioned against “panic” ahead of a potential invasion, telling Fox News he has “different information” on the likelihood of a Russian invasion.

“The truth is we have different information,” Zelenskiy told Fox reporter Trey Yingst on Saturday. “The best friend for enemies is panic in our country. And all this information that helps only for panic doesn’t help us.”

A nine-time champion of the Australian Open, who abstained from receiving the shot, Djokovic is expected to be disqualified from competing to defend his 2021 title by the country’s authorities for improper entry paperwork.

The player “failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements for Australia and visa has been subsequently canceled,” Australia Health Minister Greg Hunt said in an on-camera interview with local press on Thursday.

After traveling to Melbourne to participate in the tournament, Djokovic is reportedly being held at the airport for presenting a visa that does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated, according to Australian news outlets.

The Australian Border Force raised the issue of the athlete’s visa with the state Victoria government and suspended his admission into the country, according to The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

nationalreview,Immigration,9478,nationalreview,"U.S. taxpayers in cities nationwide will pay an estimated $5.6 million towards illegal immigrants’ legal defense against deportation this year, according to a report released Tuesday by the Immigration Reform Law Institute.

The right-leaning nonprofit found that “deportation defense” programs relied on public funding in 50 jurisdictions, 22 of which worked with the left-leaning Vera Institute of Justice.

IRLI compiled data from those 22 state and local governments and estimated that taxpayers will foot a $5.6 million bill in 2022 for the programs, which include any initiatives that offer representation and/or other legal services to a non-citizen facing deportation proceedings, typically at reduced or no cost to the defendant, according to the report.

Illegal immigrants and other non-citizens facing deportation orders do not have a right to legal representation under U.S. law because immigration law is a civil matter, not a criminal one.

Dale L. Wilcox, executive director and general counsel at IRLI, said the programs are “an insult to every law-abiding American citizen and legal resident.”

“Our laws clearly state that non-citizens charged with civil offenses do not have a right to legal representation,” Wilcox said in a statement. “Yet we have radical anti-borders groups starting these programs and sticking unknowing citizens with the bill. It’s outrageous.”

The Vera Institute of Justice, a progressive non-profit based in New York City, has served as the “main catalyst” for the proliferation of the programs, the report says. Vera provides one-time grants to localities to kickstart the programs with the aim of making these programs permanent. Taxpayers are then often forced to pick up the tab.

Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney announced the creation of the city’s program, the Pennsylvania Immigrant Family Unity Project (PAIFUP), in 2019. It launched with $100,000 from city taxpayers and another $200,000 from Vera and the Samuel S. Fels Fund.

IRLI found that officials in Philadelphia “admitted that they administered no oversight over its deportation defense program, despite funding it with hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars.” While the program was almost cut in 2020 as Covid-19 put financial strain on government budgets, the city’s leaders ultimately decided to not only continue the program, but to double taxpayer committment to $200,000 for the next fiscal year, the report says.

Meanwhile, the program has “no eligibility criteria other than income and a lack of private counsel” and does not “exclude individuals based on prior criminal convictions, residency, or any other reason,” PAIFUP’s website says.

Meanwhile, Vera has set a goal of universal representation for individuals in immigration court.

The organization told Fox News that providing legal representation to immigrants is “widely supported and in line with our most fundamental shared American values.”

“No one should appear in immigration court without a lawyer, especially when the consequences include possible deportation and separation from one’s family and community,” the statement added. “It’s the government’s responsibility to protect the fundamental rights, health, and security of everyone in our communities, including immigrants who are targeted by our expanding federal enforcement system.”

nationalreview,Immigration,9601,nationalreview,"On Friday, a group of agents openly challenged the leader of the U.S. Border Patrol, claiming that their hands have been tied by the Biden administration.

Customs and Border Protection officials got into a heated exchange with United States Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz. Frustrated with the constant influx of illegal aliens and lethal narcotics flooding the southern border, many agents indicated they feel powerless to stop the lawlessness due to regulatory limitations based on political correctness rather than reality.

“We stay focused, we continue to do the job and the mission that we signed up for . . . we all raised our hand,” Ortiz said in leaked footage released by journalist Ali Bradley, to which an officer shot back, “It’s kind of hard to say it.”

“It’s not hard to say it! It might be hard for you to say it but I’ve been doing it for 31 years,” Ortiz yelled. “Each day I wake up and I’m committed to this organization and I’m committed to each one of y’all.”

“You say that, but it seems like the policies contradict . . .” an agent started to say before Ortiz retorted, “You’re getting bogged down in the policies and the politics.”

“You can’t even say ‘illegal alien,’ that’s why Chief Scott left,” an agent said, referring to the Biden administration’s recent demand that immigration language be more “inclusive.”

“Why are you guys getting caught up in semantics? We can sit here and argue about it until we’re blue in the face,” Ortiz said, urging his men to refocus on the mission at hand. His inferiors, however, argued that the mission becomes meaningless when officers aren’t given the tools and authority to accomplish it.

“I’ve been doing this job as long as y’all,” Ortiz said.

“That’s the problem, chief,” an agent said. “For evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. That’s exactly what’s happening here. Good men are doing nothing. You’re allowing illegal aliens to be dropped off in communities…”

The chief, in response, tried to convince the agents that their work has not been in vain. “You are doing something! You’re rescuing people everyday, you’re taking fentanyl off the streets everyday, you’re taking methamphetamine off the streets everyday, illegal aliens off the streets everyday,” he said.

“Yes, and under a different administration, in the last year, we’ve had the highest fentanyl deaths in the history of our country. In one year!” an agent reminded.

Ortiz touted that the agency has had record fentanyl seizures this year, to which another agent begged the question: “How many have we not caught? . . . We don’t have results!”

nationalreview,Police,9636,nationalreview,"Four members of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Capitol riot are “devastated for our democracy” after CNN president Jeff Zucker announced his resignation earlier this week, according to a CNN correspondent.

Zucker stepped down on Wednesday after acknowledging that he had failed to disclose a romantic relationship with CNN executive vice president and chief marketing officer Allison Gollust.

“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker wrote in a memo to staff. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong.”

During a 90-minute meeting with Jason Kilar, chief executive of CNN’s parent firm, WarnerMedia, staffers from the cable news channel’s Washington bureau went to bat for Zucker and expressed concern over the future of the company, according to an audio recording obtained by the Los Angeles Times.

“I think we’ve heard a lot of corporate double talk,” said Washington correspondent Jamie Gangel. “I think the company has made a terrible mistake by doing this.”

Gangel, who has worked with Zucker since her early days as an up-and-coming producer at NBC, said she received calls from four members of the nine-person congressional panel investigating the Capitol riot “who felt devastated for our democracy” now that Zucker has left CNN.

“I do not think you have any appreciation for what you’ve done to this organization,” she said.

The committee is made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans: Representatives Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.), Elaine Luria (D., Va.), Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), Pete Aguilar (D., Calif.), Stephanie Murphy (D., Fla.), Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), Liz Cheney (R., Wy.) and Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.)

During Wednesday’s meeting with Kilar, CNN Washington correspondent Jim Acosta claimed that without Zucker’s leadership during the Trump administration “we would have probably been taken out and you would have something like Fox News lite on the air right now,” according to the report.

“It’s a rather delicate time, not just for this country but this business,” he added.

Meanwhile, anchor Jake Tapper said the network would have turned into “benign, vanilla gruel” without Zucker.

Tapper went on to claim that WarnerMedia was caving to disgraced anchor Chris Cuomo, who has promised to retaliate against Zucker for firing him without pay, the report says. Cuomo is likely to pursue legal action over his compensation, an estimated $6 million annually, according to the report.

“He threatened,” Tapper said. “Jeff said we don’t negotiate with terrorists. Chris blew the place up. How do we get past that perception that this is the bad guy winning?”

CNN fired Cuomo in December over his involvement in advising his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, on how to handle nearly a dozen sexual harassment allegations.

Zucker had supported Cuomo for months before the anchor was finally let go following the release of documents by the New York State attorney general showing that Cuomo had leaned on contacts in the media business to help his brother navigate his sexual-harassment scandal. CNN reportedly learned of a sexual misconduct allegation against Chris Cuomo by a former junior colleague at another network days before it fired the anchor, though Cuomo has denied the allegation.

For her part, Gollust, who served as a communications director for Andrew Cuomo for just four months in 2012 and 2013 before quitting to join CNN, said Wednesday she plans to remain in her role at the company.

“Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years,” she wrote. “Recently, our relationship changed during Covid. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.”

nationalreview,Police,9680,nationalreview,"Chip Slaven, formerly the interim executive director and chief executive officer of the National School Association, was allegedly aware of Attorney General Merrick Garland’s memorandum calling for federal intervention into parental “threats” against local school board members prior to its publication.

In an email exchange between NSBA board members Pam Doyle and Beverly Slough on October 5, 2021, Doyle writes that Slaven “knew about the U.S. AG directives before they were published. … So much for communicating with the BOD,” according to nonprofit Parents Defending Education.

Garland had testified before Congress that he issued the memo in direct response to a letter from the NSBA requesting the Biden administration probe and potentially prosecute parents for engaging in protest activity, which it characterized as potential “domestic terrorism.”

The memo directed the Federal Bureau of Investigation to use its resources to investigate parents deemed to be engaging in “threatening” behavior against school administrators. The documents produced by Parents Defending Education indicate that the coordination between the national school board group and the Biden administration to target parents was greater than previously determined.

In November, a whistleblower revealed the FBI created a “threat tag” to apply to situations of alleged threats against education officials.

“The purpose of the threat tag is to help scope this threat on a national level, and provide an opportunity for comprehensive analysis of the threat picture for effective engagement with law enforcement partners at all levels,” an October 20 internal email from the FBI’s criminal and counterterrorism divisions, obtained by House Republicans, read.

Last month, it was discovered that Education Secretary Miguel Cardona solicited the NSBA letter that prompted Garland’s memo, according to emails obtained by PDE. The Department of Education denied the allegation.

In an email from October 5, NSBA secretary-treasurer Kristi Swett said that Slaven “told the officers he was writing a letter to provide information to the White House, from a request by Secretary Cardona.” The letter cited 24 heated incidents between parents and school board members in local school districts as justification for federal involvement, but further review showed that the vast majority did not qualify as threats of physical violence.

As their reason for cutting ties, most state groups mentioned long-standing grievances with the national organization including meddling into their local decision-making. Most said the NBSA failed to consult or inform them before sending the letter to the Biden administration.

Since Garland’s memo was released, the NSBA has apologized for and retracted the letter, acknowledging that some of its language was inflammatory.

As of December 8th, 28 state chapters have downgraded their relationship with the NSBA, including 19 that have cancelled their memberships with the headquarters altogether. The Department of Justice has not yet rescinded its memo. Garland has also refused to dissolve the special task force established to investigate “threats” against school board members in the wake of the letter.

While the filibuster was designed to empower the minority party in the Senate, Schumer argued that it now serves to “embarrass the will of the majority,” against the founders’ intentions for legislative procedure. He claimed that Republicans should not be allowed to block the Freedom to Vote Act, using the vehicle of the filibuster, that only further enshrines and expands the American right to vote.

Schumer has previously expressed support for altering the filibuster but the statement is his strongest in favor of the idea.

“We must adapt. The Senate must evolve, like it has many times before. The Senate was designed to evolve and has evolved many times in our history,” Schumer wrote. “As former Senator Robert Byrd famously said, Senate Rules ‘must be changed to reflect changed circumstances.’ Put more plainly by Senator Byrd, ‘Congress is not obliged to be bound by the dead hand of the past.'”

“The fight for the ballot is as old as the Republic. Over the coming weeks, the Senate will once again consider how to perfect this union and confront the historic challenges facing our democracy. We hope our Republican colleagues change course and work with us. But if they do not, the Senate will debate and consider changes to Senate rules on or before January 17, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, to protect the foundation of our democracy: free and fair elections,” he added.

Republicans have argued that the proposed bill would erode the integrity of the voting process by broadening mail-in voting and diluting voter identification requirements while violating the principle of federalism by overriding state laws.

After moderate Democratic senator Joe Manchin tanked President Biden’s Build Back Better trillion-dollar social-spending package, putting it on the back burner at least temporarily, the party pivoted to its voting bill, intent on advancing at least one policy priority before the end of the legislative session. Since that shift, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Manchin’s moderate Democratic counterpart, has already reiterated that she is not interested in overhauling the institution of the filibuster to pass the voting bill, despite pressure and protests from her party.

While Schumer strongly supports changing the filibuster now, in 2005, when Senate Democrats were in the minority in Congress, said killing the filibuster would “be a doomsday for democracy.”

Referring to the GOP majority, he said then: “They want, because they can’t get their way on every judge, to change the rules in midstream, to wash away 200 years of history. They want to make this country into a banana republic where if you don’t get your way, you change the rules.”

Party leadership intends to wield the specter of the January 6 capitol riot, taking advantage of the Thursday one-year anniversary, to pressure the two hold outs on the grounds that the riot was just the beginning of a process of democratic erosion that has continued in Republican state houses.

nationalreview,Police,9546,nationalreview,"In 2016, Donald Trump argued that the presidential election was being rigged against him, even going so far as to suggest that he may not accept the results. Four years later, he acted upon this impulse when he fell short in his reelection bid.

His questioning of the legitimacy of the election was roundly condemned, especially after it culminated in the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump’s opponent and successor, Joe Biden, was particularly effusive in his criticism, comparing the riot to the Civil War and declaring that “in America, if you lose, you accept the results.”

Those past statements are out of step with the hedging rhetoric Biden used at Wednesday’s press conference. Asked if he believed the 2022 midterms would be legitimate in the event that the Democrats’ voting bill failed to pass the Senate, Biden answered “it all depends on whether or not we’re able to make the case to the American people that some of this is being set up to try to alter the outcome of the election.”

Given a chance to clarify his comments, Biden doubled down, saying “I’m not going to say it’s going to be legit. It’s — the increase and the prospect of being illegitimate is in direct proportion to us not being able to get these — these reforms passed.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Vice President Kamala Harris attempted to clean up after their boss:

Meanwhile, Republicans, especially those who pushed back most forcefully on Trump, were incensed. Nebraska senator Ben Sasse released a statement pointing out that “instead of hemming and hawing, President Biden could have simply said that America’s elections have been and will continue to be legitimate. But he didn’t say that and now his team is lying. The Vice President is doubling down while the Press Secretary is trying to spin it. This isn’t rocket science: public officials – Republicans and Democrats – should defend public trust in self-government.”

The reaction to Biden’s comments in the press, however, was muted compared to the uproar created by his predecessor’s false claims, despite the similar dearth of evidence of illegitimacy in both cases. Indeed, many who had thrown their hands up in the earlier instance were seemingly bothered this time around.

The Washington Post‘s Jennifer Rubin, for example, wrote in 2016 that “efforts to discredit the election system are preposterous on their face, but injurious to our democratic system” in reference to Trump’s comments, yet Biden’s remarks on the same subject did not even merit mention in her recap of Wednesday’s press conference, which she gave Biden an “A” for and the press a “C-.”

John Harwood, a White House correspondent for CNN, wrote in December 2020 that by questioning the legitimacy of the results, “Trump undercuts America’s faith in democracy and endangers state and local officials honestly performing their election administration duties.” Responding to Biden, however, Harwood asserted that the “entire premise of Democratic push is that GOP legislators want to erode democracy, thwarting popular will, by making voting harder for political opponents.”

“If you accept that premise – as Biden does – it logically follows that success of GOP effort undercuts the legitimacy of the election,” he continues. If you’re willing to accept any premise, anything can indeed logically follow.

And at the New York Times, columnist Charles Blow accepted the premise with gusto, lamenting the defeat of the elections bills Biden said were necessary to ensure its legitimacy by comparing the present state of affairs to the beginning of the Jim Crow era.

Yamiche Alcindor an anchor for PBS, who also contributes to NBC News and MSNBC authored a 2016 Times piece comparing Trump’s preemptive undermining of the election to tumultuous and dictatorial past political arrangements in Argentina, the Philippines, and Haiti. Her analysis of Biden’s performance was somewhat different:

Ana Navarro-Cárdenas, a cohost on The View and CNN political commentator who recently declared her belief that “Donald Trump had not been legitimately elected” in 2016 tweeted “Biden-Harris 2024” mid-press conference. In 2016, she was less enamored with Trump’s concerns, pontificating that “I know people who come from Cuba ― and you do too ― I know people who come from Venezuela. Those are rigged elections. Yesterday I was at Mt. Vernon, and it inspired me to remember and think what those Founding Fathers went through to set up this system. Is it a perfect system? No, it’s not. But stop calling it a rigged system so you can start setting up your alibi.”

Brian Karem, a longtime White House reporter who famously interrogated the former president on election legitimacy, was similarly starstruck with the current one:

In 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump said the elections would only be legitimate if he prevailed come November.

In 2022, Joe Biden said the they’d only be so if he prevailed in Congress.

Among the starkest differences between the two claims is that the latter was so easily embraced by such vast swathes of the press.

nationalreview,Police,9608,nationalreview,"The National Fraternal Order of Police, the largest law enforcement advocacy organization in the country, accused White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Monday of mocking Americans’ concerns about the rising crime rate.

The president of the group, Patrick Yoes, wrote in a statement: “I think it’s wrong – very wrong – for Ms. Psaki to suggest that violent crime in our country is of no concern or to just laugh it off.”

“She may feel safe in the White House, one of the most protected buildings in the United States, but not everyone feels safe in their workplace. The world we find ourselves in is dangerous and increasingly more so. Tens of thousands of people have been the victims of crime this month alone and some of them never made it back home,” he said.

During a recent appearance on the Pod Save America podcast, Psaki seemed perplexed that some pundits and Americans are preoccupied with spiking crime.

Referencing how right-wing news anchors have repeatedly brought up the topic, Psaki giggled, “And then on Fox is Jeanine Pirro talking about ‘soft-on-crime consequences.’ I mean, what does that even mean? Right, so there’s an alternate universe on some coverage. What’s scary about it is a lot of people watch that.”

During a press briefing Monday, Fox News reporter Jacqui Hendrich gave Psaki an opportunity to clarify her comments. Psaki said her words were taken out of context and that she was rebutting accusations that the Biden administration is “soft-on-crime.” She mentioned that President Biden is meeting with relevant leaders, such as New York City Mayor Eric Adams, to work on the issue.

“In the American Rescue Plan, there was additional funding to support local cops programs, something that every single Republican voted against. I said in that interview that I know they don’t like it when we call that out. I’m going to keep calling that out because that’s a fact,” she said.

However, while Psaki keeps repeating the claim that the GOP voted to withhold funding from the police, Washington Post fact-checkers debunked that assertion in July, rating it “mostly false” with “three pinnochios,” as they found “significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions.”

The Post pointed out that before the package went to a vote, Republican legislators received no definitive confirmation from Democrats that the $350 billion of ‘state and local aid’ allocated in the plan would be funneled to police departments. “…lawmakers had no guarantee that police would get a slice of the pie,” the fact-checker wrote.

“The president has been a long-time advocate of addressing crime. He’s never been for defunding the police. Our Department of Justice has put in place support for strike forces. And the other fact that is never talked about in these Fox packages is the fact that gun crime is a major driver of crime across the country,” Psaki asserted Monday.

In January alone, 28 law enforcement officers died in the line-of-duty, the FOP noted. That included 22-year-old cop Jason Rivera and 27-year-old cop Wilbert Mora, who were gunned down in a Harlem apartment a couple of weeks ago while responding to a domestic disturbance call.

Yoes, like many other officers, attributed the crime surge to flawed bail laws and other policies pursued by progressive prosecutors that have weakened or eliminated sentences for many offenses.

For example, Manhattan’s new progressive district attorney sent a memo to staff earlier this month calling for the “decriminalization/non prosecution” of crimes including trespassing, resisting arrest, interfering with an arrest and prostitution. He later walked back the memo, apologizing and taking “full accountability” for the “confusion caused.”

“There are many reasons for this escalating violence in many of our communities, and one of them agenda-driven prosecutors who have gone rogue. Many of them are refusing to bring charges against so-called ‘low-level’ or ‘non-violent’ offenders. Under their leadership, which has been abhorrent in many cases, many violent offenders don’t stay in jail- they’re back on the streets and free to commit more crimes,” Yoes added.

He referenced the solemn words of Rivera’s widow at her husband’s funeral last Friday, where she said: “The system continues to fail us. We are not safe anymore, not even members of the service.”

“These are stark words, but they are nonetheless true,” Yoes said. Pretending violent crimes are part of some other reality will not help victims. Ms. Psaki owes them an apology.”

nationalreview,Police,9941,nationalreview,"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been sentenced to serve another nine years in prison after he was convicted on trumped up embezzlement and contempt of court on Tuesday.

“Navalny committed fraud — the theft of property by an organized group,” Judge Margarita Kotova announced the verdict, according to Agence France-Presse. The court also found him guilty of being disrespectful to the court.

The sentence extension was announced shortly after the verdict, according to the Moscow Times.

Navalny had been accused of stealing several million dollars worth of donations from his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The prosecution in the case last week demanded that Navalny’s sentence be extended to 13 years, that he be moved to a “strict regime” penal colony, and that he pay a fine of 1.2 million rubles, or about $11,500.

The anti-corruption activist had already been imprisoned for two-and-a-half years at a detention center for violating probation related to a previous conviction on sham embezzlement charges. Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia to face the charges after after spending a month in a German hospital, where he was being treated for nerve-agent poisoning.

The former mayoral and presidential candidate claimed his treatment was politically motivated and green-lighted by Putin’s regime. The Kremlin denied that it played a role. Protests erupted across Russia in the two weeks prior to his sentencing and also after it was handed down, which were squashed by Russian authorities.

Navalny looked defiant and calm on video camera Tuesday, flipping through documents as the verdict was read. Each time he has been convicted of criminal activity by Russia, he has doubled down. On March 15, he posted on Instagram, “If the prison term is the price of my human right to say things that need to be said … then they can ask for 113 years. I will not renounce my words or deeds.”

Navalny and his close associates were listed on the “extremist and terrorist” federal registry in Russia, according to the Russian Federal Service for Financial Monitoring. Russian courts banned his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) last year, calling it an “extremist” group.

The dissident’s likely prison extension comes amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has triggered anti-war demonstrations across Russia and police crackdowns. In the early days of the conflict, Russian police arrested thousands of protestors calling for peace. In January, Navalny criticized the Biden administration for failing to confront the Kremlin for its aggression, likening the U.S. to a ” frightened schoolboy ” who cowers to a bully. At that point, Russia had ramped up its provocation, stationing over 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine.

Navalny told Time’s Simon Shuster, “Time and again the West falls into Putin’s elementary traps. It just takes my breath away, watching how Putin pulls this on the American establishment again and again.”

President Biden has repeatedly condemned Russia’s treatment of Navalny, warning last June that his death would erode U.S.-Russia relations. But that relationship has greatly deteriorated anyway since Russia launched the assault on its neighbor.

nationalreview,Police,9973,nationalreview,"Chris Wallace recently explained his decision to leave his post as a Fox News anchor after 18 years, saying he “just no longer felt comfortable with the programming at Fox,” according to a new report.

“I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion,” Wallace told the New York Times. “But when people start to question the truth — Who won the 2020 election? Was Jan. 6 an insurrection? — I found that unsustainable.”

He added that he “spent a lot of 2021 looking to see if there was a different place for me to do my job.”

Wallace declined to renew his contract as host of Fox News Sunday in December and now will host a daily interview show — Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace — on the new CNN+ streaming service beginning Tuesday.

Wallace said he became increasingly concerned in the months after former President Trump’s 2020 loss as the channel fired the political editor who helped project a Trump defeat in Arizona on election night and promoted hosts, including Tucker Carlson, who downplayed the Capitol riot.

Wallace told the New York Times he took his concerns about Carlson’s documentary, Patriot Purge, which falsely suggested the riot was a “false flag” operation to gin up opposition against conservatives, directly to Fox News management.

“Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox,” Wallace said. “And since November of 2020, that just became unsustainable, increasingly unsustainable as time went on.”

“Some people might have drawn the line earlier, or at a different point,” he said, adding: “I think Fox has changed over the course of the last year and a half. But I can certainly understand where somebody would say, ‘Gee, you were a slow learner, Chris.’”

He did not comment when asked about Fox News hosts’ recent coverage of Russia and Ukraine, according to the report.

“One of the reasons that I left Fox was because I wanted to put all of that behind me,” Wallace told the New York Times, saying that since he left, “there has not been a moment when I have second-guessed myself about that decision.”

However, Wallace said he is “obviously unhappy” that former CNN president Jeff Zucker, who hired him, resigned in February over an undisclosed relationship with a colleague.

“It’s not ideal,” he said.

The anchor added that in making the switch to CNN+, he sought to “get out of politics” and will now focus on other topics, including sports and the arts.

“Doing a Sunday show on the incremental change from week to week in the Build Back Better plan began to lose its attraction,” he said.

nationalreview,Police,9626,nationalreview,"South Dakota governor Kristi Noem introduced legislation Wednesday to prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in public schools and higher-education training and orientation for students and staff.

The bill ensures that “critical race theory will not be taught in [South Dakota] schools, that no one will be taught that someone is better or less than someone else based on their sex or their race, and also that kids can’t be compelled to participate in riots or protests or lobbying on a specific agenda,” the governor told Fox News.

“[In] the rest of the country, we see people getting engaged that never have before,” she added. “That means that we end up getting policies in place that protect our kids and make sure that they learn a true and honest history about this country and who they are as an individual.”

Republican-dominated states across the country have pitched or passed similar legislation that would abolish such racialized ideology from K–12 curricula — ideology professing that slavery and white supremacy are irredeemable stains on America’s history and that oppressive remnants are still pervasive today. As one of his first orders of business upon assuming office, Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin banned critical race theory in public schools.

Noem told Fox News that CRT does not represent U.S. history and is antithetical to our national character.

“This country was created so people would have freedom and an opportunity to be treated the same as everybody else,” she said. “And certainly we have flaws in our background, but we learn from them, and we strive to do better in the future. And that’s really what we want our kids to learn and take out of their education systems.”

In May, Noem signed a candidate pledge, sponsored by “1776 Action,” to promote patriotic education and bar “action civics” (mandatory political protests for course credit) and critical race theory from our schools. With her latest legislation, she appears to be following through on that promise.

nationalreview,Police,9751,nationalreview,"The Pentagon has approved the deployment of 700 unarmed National Guard members to Washington, D.C., along with 50 “large tactical vehicles” in preparation for a potential protest convoy in the district similar to the Canadian “Freedom Convoy.”

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved the request from Washington, D.C., officials and the U.S. Capitol Police on Tuesday, the Pentagon said in a statement.

The deployment will include 400 District of Columbia guard members and 300 members from other states, the D.C. National Guard said in a statement, according to USA Today. The guard members will not be authorized to conduct “domestic surveillance activities,” the statement added.

The request comes as several American groups inspired by the Canadian “Freedom Convoy” are expected to descend on Washington, D.C., in the coming weeks to protest Covid-19 pandemic restrictions.

The “People’s Convoy” is set to begin its eleven-day trip from Victorville, Calif., to the Capitol Beltway on Wednesday. The group, which argues it is “now time to re-open the country” after two years of Covid-19 restrictions, said it does not plan on entering D.C. proper.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania truck driver Bob Bolus says he is leading a U.S. “Freedom Convoy” of trucks from Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C., as soon as today with the goal of gridlocking the Capitol Beltway to protest vaccine mandates and Covid-19-related restrictions, among other issues.

Truckers have requested a National Park Service permit to allow a gathering of 1,000 to 3,000 in Washington, D.C., a source told Fox News.

The National Guard vehicles are expected to begin posting up at strategic intersections before 1 p.m. on Saturday or as soon as possible. The mission will continue until March 8, if necessary.

Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee said Friday that officials expect there will be “disruptions to traffic, that kind of thing.”

“I think we need to be very candid with the public about some of the expectations based upon what we’ve seen in Ottawa,” he said.

Police have also started limiting time off for officers. Nearly 500 officers will be placed on civil disturbance units each day beginning Wednesday, FOX5 DC reported.

The preparation comes as Canadian police broke up the “Freedom Convoy” protest that shut down Ottawa during a three-week-long standoff. Police arrested 191 people, filed 389 charges and towed 99 vehicles, authorities said Sunday.

nationalreview,Police,9805,nationalreview,"One year into his presidency, it seems like Joe Biden and the Democrats in Washington, D.C. have sent the country back in time to the late-1970s and early 80s, “when runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map,” Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said Tuesday night, in the official Republican response to Biden’s State of the Union address.

Speaking in front of the Iowa state capitol in Des Moines, Reynolds attacked Biden’s international and domestic record, and she made the case for putting faith in the American people. Dressed in red and wearing an American and Ukrainian flag pin, she spoke about 15 minutes.

When he was elected, Biden promised to make America respected again on the world stage and unite the country. Instead, Reynolds said, “he’s failed on both fronts.”

Internationally, Reynolds said, the “disastrous” Afghanistan withdrawal betrayed American allies and embolden the country’s enemies. Biden did not address the Afghanistan withdrawal in his speech. And while Reynolds said Americans should stand united with the people of Ukraine who are fighting back against a Russian onslaught, she said Americans shouldn’t ignore Biden’s actions in the run-up to the invasion.

“Waiving sanctions on Russian pipelines,” she said. “Eliminating oil production here at home. Focusing on political correctness rather than military readiness. Reacting to world events instead of driving them.”

It is time for America to lead again on the world stage, Reynold said. “But we can’t project strength abroad if we’re weak at home.”

Reynolds accused Biden of ignoring Republican warnings that increased government spending would lead to inflation, and that the administration’s anti-energy policies would lead to soaring gas prices. She said inflation is not a “high-class problem,” but is instead an “everybody problem.”

Biden and Democratic leaders need to step outside the D.C. bubble, and talk to regular Americans about their concerns, and “what keeps them up at night.”

“I can tell you what’s not on that list,” she said. “They won’t tell you that spending trillions more and bankrupting their children is the answer to their problems. They won’t tell you that we should be paying people not to work. And they certainly won’t tell you that we should be giving billions in tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires in Democratic controlled states like California, New York, and New Jersey.”

Reynolds said Americans are tired of elites who tell others what they can and cannot say, what they can and cannot believe, and they’re tired of hypocritical politicians who tell their citizens to stay home during the Covid-19 pandemic, while they sneak off to Florida for “sun and fun.” Americans are tired of liberal prosecutors letting criminals off easy while crime soars, and they’re fed up with an administration that proposed vaccination requirements for people who want to work, but not for immigrants who cross the border illegally, Reynolds said.

“The American people are left to feel like they’re the enemy”, she said, and they “are waiting for the insanity to stop.”

Reynolds praised Republican governors and red state leaders who are “balancing budgets and cutting taxes,” and who she said listened to science when it came to not requiring masks for kids at schools. School shutdowns have led to learning loss, isolation, and anxiety among America’s kids, she said.

“That’s why Iowa was the first state in the nation to require that schools open their doors,” she said. “I was attacked by the left. I was attacked by the media. But it wasn’t a hard choice.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Reynold’s message “optimistic” and “a stark contrast to Biden’s broken promises and Democrats’ divisive agenda.”

“Republican officials like Kim Reynolds have a record of real solutions helping struggling American families, workers, and small businesses,” McDaniel said in a prepared statement.

nationalreview,Police,9677,nationalreview,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) on Sunday claimed that “defund the police” is “not the position of the Democratic Party” after Representative Cori Bush (D., Mo.) recently endorsed the slogan.

“Well, with all the respect in the world for Cori Bush, that is not the position of the Democratic Party,” Pelosi said during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “Community safety, to protect and defend in every way, is our oath of office. And I have sympathy — I — we’re all concerned about mistreatment of people.”

Pelosi touted the House-passed Justice in Policing Act, which would overhaul national policing standards, saying, “Make no mistake, community safety is our responsibility.”

The House speaker’s comments came in response to Bush’s statement last week that “‘defund the police’ is not the problem.”

“We dangled the carrot in front of people’s faces and said we can get it done and that Democrats deliver, when we haven’t totally delivered,” she said, adding that she tells her Democratic colleagues that if they had “fixed this” before she got there she wouldn’t have to “say these things.”

She added that she “absolutely” felt pressure from fellow Democrats to change her position, saying they have told her the phrase is not helpful for them with their own constituents.

Meanwhile, despite Pelosi’s claims, numerous Democrats have supported the “defund the police” movement in the years since George Floyd’s murder in 2020.

Members of the progressive “Squad” have all advocated for defunding or abolishing police.

Representative Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) said in June 2020: “The ‘defund the police’ movement, is one of reimagining the current police system to build an entity that does not violate us, while relocating funds to invest in community services. Let’s be clear, the people who now oppose this, have always opposed calls for systematic change.”

In April 2021, Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) called policing in the U.S. “inherently & intentionally racist,” saying she is “done with those who condone government funded murder.”

“No more policing, incarceration, and militarization. It can’t be reformed,” she said.

The same month, Representative Ayanna Pressley similarly said of policing in America: “We can’t reform this.”

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in June 2020: “Defunding police means defunding police. It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education’s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.”

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris was also sympathetic to the movement in June 2020 when she was asked by ABC’s George Stephanopoulos if she supports proposals to re-appropriate police funding, including a proposal in Los Angeles at the time to divert $150 million from the police budget into other community priorities.

“I support investing in communities so that they become more healthy and therefore more safe. Right now what we’re seeing in America is many cities spend over one-third of their entire city budget on policing. But meanwhile we’ve been defunding public schools for years in America, we’ve got to reexamine what we’re doing with Americans’ taxpayer dollars, and ask the question are we getting the right return on our investment? Are we actually creating healthy and safe communities?” Harris said at the time.

nationalreview,Police,9907,nationalreview,"Jussie Smollett will be released from jail pending the appeal of his conviction for staging a hoax hate crime against himself and then falsely reporting it to police, an appeals court ruled in a 2-1 decision Wednesday.

The ruling comes one week after the former Empire star was sentenced to five months in an Illinois jail for the hoax, which occurred in 2019.

Smollett’s attorneys argued that the disgraced actor would have finished out his sentence by the time the appeal process had been completed and raised concerns that he could be in danger of physical harm if he remained in Cook County Jail.

The court ruled that Smollett can be released after posting a personal recognizance bond of $150,000. This means he is not required to put down money but agrees to appear in court when required.

It was not immediately clear how soon Smollett would be released, according to the Associated Press.

Judge James Linn sentenced Smollett to 150 days in jail and 30 months of probation last week after a nearly seven-hour hearing. He was ordered to pay restitution of just over $120,000 and a $25,000 criminal fine after being found guilty of five counts of disorderly conduct in December.

Smollett made a false report to Chicago police in January 2019, when he claimed he had been attacked by two men who shouted racial and homophobic slurs at him and wrapped a rope around his neck, prosecutors said. He told police the assault occurred in the middle of a frigid Chicago night while he was out picking up a Subway sandwich.

Police initially investigated the alleged incident, which Smollett claimed happened in the upscale neighborhood of Streeterville, but ultimately shifted focus to probing whether Smollett paid brothers Ola and Abel Osundairo to stage an attack after first investigating the brothers as persons of interest.

Smollett orchestrated the fake hate crime, paying the two men $3,500 to help him, prosecutors said.

Linn called Smollett a charlatan who pretended to be a victim of a hate crime because he wanted attention, calling the hoax “premeditated to the extreme.”

The judge said the evidence against the actor was “overwhelming.”

“You’ve been lying and lying and lying about this case,” Linn said.

newsmax,Abortion,14579,newsmax,"Vice President Kamala Harris is preparing to meet Democrat lawmakers Friday in five states where abortion is expected to be limited soon, The Washington Post reported.

Her scheduled visit comes roughly three weeks after the Supreme Court overturned the nearly 50-year Roe precedent in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, sending the abortion issue back to states.

Harris is slated to visit Indiana, Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska and Montana, all of which have indicated support for further restrictions to the procedure.

Among the notable names in attendance will be Indiana House Minority Leader Phil GiaQuinta, South Dakota House Minority Whip Erin Healy, and incoming Florida House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell.

The meetings, livestreamed publicly from the vice president's ceremonial office, are part of the Biden administration's broader role assigned to Harris of taking leadership on abortion-related issues in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision.

So far, the vice president has reportedly held meetings with faith leaders, healthcare providers, constitutional lawyers and privacy experts to prepare new ways of ensuring abortion access nationwide, including access to medically-induced abortion.

Professor Jessie Hill of Case Western Reserve University told CBS News that the Justice Department could use the Food and Drug Administration's superior jurisdiction over states to protect access to abortion pills like mifepristone.

""The idea here would be the federal government has said mifepristone is safe and effective and given it a license to be sold in every state in the U.S.,"" Hill suggested. ""No state can turn around and forbid it.""

However, ""one of the challenges is you have to show a clear conflict, and it's not obvious there is one,"" she added. ""It's very unsettled, but there could be some hurdles with a lawsuit like that.""",Abortion
newsmax,Abortion,12970,newsmax,"Wednesday night's Newsmax debate for Pennsylvania's Republican Senate Primary might prove pivotal in one of the nation's most hotly contested races.

All five of the leading candidates took part in the showdown moderated by Greta Van Susteren at Grove City College, taking aim at President Joe Biden, Democrats, and even each other as the May 17 election nears.

""I have the wisdom and what it takes to have a bold, loud voice in Washington,"" Dr. Oz Mehmet, said in his closing remarks.

""The reason President [Donald] Trump endorsed me – and he gave a lot – was that he knew I would win in November.""

As other candidates targeted frontrunner Oz, the retired heart surgeon did little to respond other than often invoking Donald Trump's name.

""[Donald Trump] felt that I was the most capable of doing what we have to do as a party,"" Oz continued.

""I am confident that if I am honored with your votes, I will be able to do exactly what he promised I would do, which is to be smart, tough, and never let you down.""

A well-known TV personality, Oz received the coveted Trump endorsement that vaulted him into a lead in the polls.

During the debate, Oz took aim at Biden on his massive spending plan called Build Back Better that failed in the Senate late last year.

""The only thing Joe Biden has built back better is the Republican party,"" Oz said.

""The liberals are taking over our media. They control much of government. Corporate suites are dominated by the woke ideology in our universities, as well. We've got to engage in all levels.""

Despite Oz's slim lead, the race remains close, with former hedge fund CEO David McCormick considered a close second.

Repeatedly during the debate, real estate developer Jeff Bartos hit out at McCormick for having lived in Connecticut and for his significant business dealings with China and elsewhere.

Carla Sands, President Trump's former ambassador to Denmark, argued she would be an experienced administration veteran pushing an America First agenda in the Senate.

Commentator Kathy Barnette, shocked the audience by noting her own birth was the result of a rape, but she remains an ardent pro-life advocate.

Barnette also took first aim at the Democrats' recent politicization of the Supreme Court draft opinion on a potential overruling of Roe v. Wade on abortion.

""Whether this was a leak, or whether it was a tactical operation – we will still figure out – but one thing is clear: I am so very grateful that our nation is now having a very important conversation, and that is one of the most important conversations, that is about life,"" Barnette said.

Oz responded to the claim he once supported abortion rights, simply saying he now believes ""life begins at conception.""

Sands took aim at both polling leaders, calling Oz a ""MINO, and that is MAGA in name only,"" and McCormick a ""Mitt Romney Republican.""

Sands also delivered a powerful message on foreign policy, hitting President Biden on Ukraine and unwinding of ""energy dominance.""

""Our adversaries are serious,"" Sands said in her one minute on foreign policy experience. ""These are serious times. They require a senator who's ready on day one.""

Sands also ripped Biden administration policies limiting oil and gas production in states like Pennsylvania.

""We don't need to be buying energy from places like Russia, Venezuela, and like Joe Biden's radical administration suggested: Iran. That's blood energy.""

McCormick hit the Biden administration hard on inflation, particularly with respect to energy.

""A big part of the inflation is that rise in the cost of fuel, and what Joe Biden is done has taken us from being a net energy exporter to net energy importers in 15 short months,"" McCormick said.

""We need to unlock that energy that will unlock our economy as well and put inflation in check. The third thing we need to do is have pro-growth economic policies, make permanent the Trump tax cuts, and deregulate.""

The Pennsylvania Senate seat to replace retiring Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., is one of the key battlegrounds for the 2022 midterms, particularly since Biden won the state with 80,000 votes.

""There are only two states on the map that Republicans hold that Democrats won in the presidential race, and those are Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,"" according to Cook Political Report analyst Jessica Taylor. ""Of those races, Pennsylvania, I think especially given that it's an open seat, is really the best opportunity that Democrats have to flip a seat.""

The Trafalgar Group polling, which correctly projected the Ohio GOP Senate primary winner J.D. Vance in Tuesday night's election, has Oz leading the Pennsylvania primary with 23%, McCormick at 20%, Barnette 18%, Carla Sands 11%, and Bartos at 8%.

The poll had 17% of likely Pennsylvania GOP primary voters still undecided and a margin of error of 2.99 percentage points.

newsmax,Abortion,16794,newsmax,"President Joe Biden targeted new birth control guidelines from the University of Idaho that prohibit staff from offering birth control to students and promoting abortion, The Hill reported.

During a Tuesday meeting of the White House Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, Biden frustratingly addressed the news before directing Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to prevent similar policies from spreading across the country.

“Folks, what century are we in? What are we doing? I respect everyone’s view on this — personal decision they make. But, my Lord, we’re talking about contraception here. It shouldn’t be that controversial,” Biden stated.

“My message to any other colleges considering enacting policies like this: Don’t. Please don’t,” he pleaded. “We’re not going to sit by and let Republicans throughout the country enact extreme policies to threaten access to basic health care, and that’s why we’re all here today.”

The University of Idaho’s new policy comes after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, thus allowing a state trigger ban on abortion after conception except in cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is at risk.

It also allowed Idaho’s No Public Funds for Abortion Act to come into effect fully, which prevents public colleges from promoting birth control. As written in the law, anyone who publishes a notice “for the prevention of conception” is guilty of a felony.

Cardona followed up on Biden’s remarks at the meeting by insisting that students require “access to health care to thrive in school and in life, and that includes reproductive health care.”

“The Dobbs ruling has sown fear and confusion on our college campuses [and] I worry about the chilling effects this uncertainty, including about access to birth control, will have on students,” the education secretary added.",Abortion
newsmax,Abortion,14296,newsmax,"The largest U.S. law firms did not take a public stance following the U.S. Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade on Friday, diverging from the approach of some major companies that have made statements on the closely watched abortion case.

The high court's 6-3 Dobbs decision upheld a Republican-backed Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Many states are expected to further restrict or ban abortions following the ruling.

Reuters on Friday asked more than 30 U.S. law firms, including the 20 largest by total number of lawyers, for comments on the Dobbs ruling and whether they would cover travel costs for employees seeking an abortion.

The vast majority did not respond by Saturday afternoon, and only two, Ropes & Gray and Morrison & Foerster, said they would implement such a travel policy.

Morrison & Foerster, with nearly 1,000 attorneys, was the only large firm to issue a public statement by Saturday afternoon.

The firm's chair, Larren Nashelsky, said Morrison & Foerster would “redouble our efforts to protect abortion and other reproductive rights.“

The Dobbs decision has been expected since a draft opinion was leaked in May.

Several major U.S. corporations, including The Walt Disney Co. and Meta Platforms said on Friday they will cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions.

Industry experts say law firms could speak out on Dobbs in the future if employees and clients push them to take a public stance. For now, firm leaders appear to be carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages of commenting, including the possibility of alienating clients, experts said.

""This is a tightrope to walk for firms,"" said Kent Zimmermann, a law firm consultant with the Zeughauser Group. ""They have a diversity of views among their talent and clients.""

Some firms have issued internal communications to employees about the decision. Ropes & Gray Chair Julie Jones said in an internal memo viewed by Reuters that the firm will hold several community gatherings to discuss the ruling and offer ""comfort.""

""As a leader of Ropes & Gray, I am concerned about the effect of this decision on our community,"" Jones wrote, while acknowledging that her memo may cause ""offense to portions of our community.""

A Ropes & Gray spokesperson told Reuters Friday that employees enrolled in its medical plan are eligible for financial assistance to travel out of state for an abortion.

Another large U.S. law firm, Steptoe & Johnson, offered its U.S. workforce the day off on Friday, a spokesperson confirmed. The spokesperson did not immediately respond to further requests for comment.

Despite a dearth of public statements, a number of law firms publicly signaled ahead of the ruling that they planned to provide free legal support to women seeking abortions if Roe was overturned.

Both the New York Attorney General Leticia James and the San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu, with the Bar Association of San Francisco, have convened pro bono initiatives that rely on law firm volunteers. Paul Weiss, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and O'Melveny & Myers are among the participants.

Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp called the Dobbs decision a ""crushing loss"" in an internal message to the firm on Friday provided to Reuters. Paul Weiss and O'Melveny, which both represented Jackson Women's Health Organization, respondents in the Dobbs case, deferred comment on the ruling to their co-counsel, the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The center said in a statement that the court had ""hit a new low by taking away – for the first time ever – a constitutionally guaranteed personal liberty.""

Gibson Dunn did not respond to request for comment.

Robert Kamins, a consultant with Vertex Advisors who works with law firms, said firms will be ""very cautious"" about taking early positions on the ruling.

""They have to make sure that they are being thoughtful about it,"" he said. ""What is the business impact? What is the client impact? What is the recruiting impact? There are lots of things to think about.""",Abortion
newsmax,Abortion,13676,newsmax,"The American Civil Liberties Union and a group of abortion providers in Florida have filed a lawsuit to stop the state's new law banning abortion after 15 weeks, reports the Tampa Bay Times.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed HB 5 into law on April 14. It bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy without exemptions for rape, incest, or human trafficking. Set to go into effect July 1, the law does allow exceptions in cases where a pregnancy is considered ""a serious risk"" to the mother, or when a fatal fetal abnormality is detected, but only if two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing.

The ACLU of Florida and two regional Planned Parenthood offices and six abortion providers filed the lawsuit in Leon County Circuit Court against the state of Florida, the Agency for Health Care Administration, the Department of Health and every judicial circuit's state attorney.

They are seeking an injunction to keep the bill from going into effect.

The groups say HB 5 threatens doctors with jail time and violates privacy rights that are enshrined in the state constitution.

""Absent an injunction, the Act will prevent Floridians from exercising their fundamental constitutional right to decide whether to have an abortion prior to viability, causing irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law,"" the lawsuit states.

ACLU of Florida Legal Director Daniel Tilley in a statement wrote that the new law blocks women from access to essential abortion care.

""Not only does HB 5 defy the will of the people, it ignores the real life circumstances of people who need an abortion and deliberately puts them in harm's way,"" Tilley said. ""With the U.S. Supreme Court threatening to take away the federal right to abortion, we will do everything in our power to block this cruel attack on Floridians' fundamental right to get the care they need.""

The Center for Reproductive Rights in a statement said Florida's 15-week ban would have ""devastating"" effects on abortion access in the surrounding region.

""Floridians already face burdensome restrictions to getting an abortion — such as a ban on insurance plans on the state exchange covering abortion; a parental consent requirement that makes it harder for young people to get abortions; and a law that requires people to make an additional, unnecessary trip to an abortion provider before receiving care, which took effect in April,"" it added.

Florida allowed abortion until the third trimester of pregnancy before HB 5 was signed into law.",Abortion
newsmax,Abortion,13853,newsmax,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Wednesday on Newsmax accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of sounding the ""dog whistle"" that led to an armed man showing up in the early morning hours outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home.

""The left always gives a dog whistle of violence, and Chuck Schumer is on record on video, calling for violence, basically a dog whistle for them to come after Justices Kavanaugh and [Neil] Gorsuch,"" the Georgia Republican said on Newsmax's ""John Bachman Now."" ""He named them by name, and he said they won't even know what hit them. Was he talking about a bullet? Was he talking about a knife? What kind of attack?""

In March, Schumer, D-N.Y., was criticized after standing outside the Supreme Court, surrounded by abortion rights supporters, and commenting that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh ""have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,"" reports The Washington Post.

The comments came while the justices were deliberating a crucial Louisiana abortion case, and before the Roe v. Wade leak indicating that the court would overturn the landmark 1973 decision. Schumer has denied making a call for violence with his comments, with a spokesman saying he meant Republicans would pay a political price"" for an anti-abortion decision, but Greene on Newsmax disagreed.

""Clearly he was talking about something and some of their foot soldiers took their orders, and this man was found at Kavanaugh's house ready to kill him,"" Greene insisted.

She also said that there has been no effort to go after the person who leaked the Roe v. Wade draft decision, which has left the conservative-leaning justices' lives in danger. Further, protests have been allowed to be held at the justices' homes, and that should have been stopped, Greene commented.

""There should have been a bigger effort by the Department of Justice to stop these protests, and thankfully, this man was arrested before he did the unthinkable,"" said Greene. ""Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and others, we don't see an effort for them to protect anyone but themselves.""

Greene also lambasted Democrats for their decision to call victims and families from the Uvalde school shootings to Washington, D.C. to testify in the gun control legislation hearings on Capitol Hill, including one little girl who covered herself in blood to survive.

""It's shameful to pull these families, especially an 11-year-old girl who laid there in the blood of her classmates after they had been murdered, just trying to be quiet and protect her own life,"" she said. ""These families are in mourning. They should be left alone not used as political props and some sort of stunt to force and persuade other members of Congress to vote for gun control in America.

""We don't have a gun problem in America, we have a sin problem … our children are our future. And so we should do everything we can to keep them safe at school and never, ever allow anything to happen to them or any parent to have to fear what may happen.""

newsmax,Abortion,14359,newsmax,"State Sen. Darren Bailey is the projected winner of the Republican nomination for governor in Illinois, according to Decision Desk HQ.

Bailey was endorsed by former President Donald Trump and will face incumbent Democrat J.B. Pritzker, a billionaire who easily won the Democratic nomination

Bailey, is a farmer who received former President Donald Trump’s endorsement Saturday. Bailey raised his statewide profile during the pandemic by opposing Pritzker’s COVID-19 measures. He sued Pritzker over a stay-at-home order the governor issued, and was escorted off the floor of the Legislature for refusing to wear a mask.

Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune who is seeking his second term, and the Democratic Governors Association spent heavily on advertising to help Bailey win the GOP primary, including with ads noting he is “100% pro-life.” While those messages have raised Bailey's standing with Republican voters, they are likely to hurt him in a general election in a place where Democrats control all statewide offices and voters twice rejected Trump by double digits.

Bailey rejected the idea that he cannot win and criticized “establishment Republicans” for contributing to decades of mismanagement in the state.

“We’re going to send a message to the Republican establishment that we will not be bullied into sacrificing our principles to elect their candidates,"" he told a crowd at a campaign stop in rural Illinois this month.

Bailey defeated Richard Irvin, a former prosecutor who was the first Black mayor of Illinois' second-largest city. Unlike Bailey and his four other rivals, Irvin avoided talking about abortion or saying whether he voted for Trump. The mayor of Aurora instead focused on issues such as crime in Chicago and legislation signed by Pritzker that he said made policing harder. He said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of the mother.

Irvin also argued that he was the only GOP candidate who could beat Pritzker in November because he could win votes from Republicans, independents and some Democrats.

The other Republican candidates were business owner Gary Rabine, venture capitalist Jesse Sullivan, former state Sen. Paul Schimpf and attorney Max Solomon.",Abortion
newsmax,Abortion,14244,newsmax,"Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis offered a brief, but firm response to Friday's U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the Roe v. Wade case from 1973, which legalized abortion in America for nearly 50 years.

For his lone Twitter post involving the high court ruling, Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, DeSantis initially teased, ""By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Supreme Court has answered the prayers of millions upon millions of Americans.""

DeSantis then added: ""The prayers of millions have been answered. For nearly fifty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited virtually any meaningful pro-life protection, but this was not grounded in the text, history, or structure of the Constitution. By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Dobbs majority has restored the people's role in our republic and a sense of hope that every life counts.

""Florida will continue to defend its recently-enacted pro-life reforms against state court challenges, will work to expand pro-life protections, and will stand for life by promoting adoption, foster care, and child welfare.""

DeSantis noted the decision dovetails with the law he enacted in April, banning abortions after 15 weeks in Florida, a move that would reportedly protect 5,000 babies every year.

At a press conference from two months ago, DeSantis said: ""We're here ... to protect life. We're here today to defend those who can't defend themselves.""

The Florida governor said the bill ""protects the rights of unborn children starting at 15 weeks. This is a time where these babies have beating hearts. They can move; they can taste; they can see; they can feel pain; they can suck their thumb; and they have brain waves.""

""Life is a sacred gift worthy of our protection, and I am proud to sign this great piece of legislation which represents the most significant protections for life in the state's modern history,"" DeSantis added.

""So this will represent the most significant protections for life that have been enacted in this state in a generation,"" added DeSantis, who's up for gubernatorial reelection this November, and will face either Charlie Crist or Nikki Fried as the state's Democratic Party challenger.

newsmax,Abortion,11309,newsmax,"Several states controlled by Republicans are considering banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy as soon as this week in a move that is causing division within the conservative movement, Politico reported Wednesday.

The states are planning to approve bills based on a Mississippi law that conservatives are confident the Supreme Court will soon rule as constitutional, but critics in the anti-abortion movement say that is not enough, and GOP-controlled legislatures should be following the lead of Texas, which has signed a new law restricting abortions as early as six weeks.

Lawmakers in the states advancing 15-week bans say they are taking a politically and legally safer approach, even if it means the vast majority of abortions in their states could still take place, because they are concerned the Supreme Court could eventually undo the Texas law, which faces multiple legal challenges and less support among the public.

""States don't want to pass laws that are going to be struck down; they don't want an exercise in futility,"" Denise Harle, the senior counsel for the anti-abortion group Alliance Defending Freedom, told Politico. ""The prudence of doing 15 weeks right now, when a green light for them is likely, is clear.""

But Kristi Hamrick, the spokesperson for Students for Life of America, said ""we respectfully disagree"" with those that ""believe we should proceed cautiously and strategically,"" adding ""we want to see less incrementalism. This is a time to move in for the win.""

Abortion-rights activists are very concerned the goalposts are changing for the roughly 24 weeks allowed to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade, according to Politico.

Jessica Arons, a senior policy council with the ACLU, cited Texas-style six-week bans that have been introduced in Arizona and Florida but have not yet advanced, explaining, ""then, when they ultimately pass the 15-week bill, it allows them to position it as a reasonable compromise. They're moving the Overton window and pushing the idea of what is an acceptable center.""

Such thinking can be seen among several leaders of GOP-led states. For example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who indicated he intends to sign the 15-week abortion ban expected to pass as early as this week, said the bill was ""very reasonable"" and ""a lot of people would be happy with that.""

In another example of this line of thinking, Arizona GOP state Sen. Nancy Barto on the Senate floor last week said, while she believes ""every life should be protected,"" 15 weeks is a ""common sense limit"" and a ""step in the right direction.""

Olivia Cappello, who works on state policy fights with Planned Parenthood, bemoaned this tactic.

""The six-week bans have generated a lot of outrage and protest, so when they pull back with a 15-week ban, it flies under the radar a little more,"" she told Politico. ""But any sort of arbitrary limitation on what you can and cannot do with your body and what decisions you can make about your pregnancy has a terrible impact on people and the children they already have.""

Some groups on the right are urging lawmakers to wait until the Supreme Court issues a decision – and states know exactly what the standard will be – before passing any abortion laws so they do not get bogged down in costly legal battles.",Abortion
newsmax,Abortion,14545,newsmax,"A court's ruling that Florida can keep its ban on abortions that take place past 15 weeks of pregnancy is a win not only for the right to life, but also ""for the sanctity of our Constitution,"" Rep. Kat Cammack said on Newsmax Wednesday.

""I am so lucky to live in a state where we have incredibly strong leadership out of our state officials, of course, Gov. Ron DeSantis at the helm, but it was actually our attorney general, Ashley Moody, who within minutes of the district circuit judge issuing that ruling [to lift the ban] that she filed an appeal, which has led to the will of the people here in Florida to be upheld,"" the Florida Republican told Newsmax's ""National Report.""

In Florida, the state promptly filed an appeal soon after Circuit Court Judge John Cooper finalized an expected order blocking enforcement of a 15-week ban that took effect on Friday, which automatically froze the injunction.

""Our entire system of government is predicated on this notion of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" Cammack said, noting that after the Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, states like Florida are ""leading the charge in protecting life, and I couldn't be more proud of that.""

The congresswoman, meanwhile, slammed companies such as Disney which have promised to cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions.

""It's interesting how they like to choose ala carte the human rights issues that they're going to uphold,"" she said. ""When it comes to all lives or unborn lives, they don't seem to [care]. It's really interesting that as these companies continue to push out this woke messaging to try to appease the limousine liberal base that is growing across the country.

""They're also really quiet when it comes to the fact that many of these companies do not offer maternity leave or paid maternity leave. ""

Cammack said Republicans are working on legislation to help make adoption more accessible and more affordable, as well as finding ways to support working mothers.

""That's what the pro-life movement is all about,"" she said. ""It's about empowering women and being part of the post-Roe generation means that we have a tremendous responsibility to stand up for our women.""

The congresswoman also on Wednesday slammed California's Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom for running advertising urging people in Florida to move to his state ""where we still believe in freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate, and the freedom to love.""

""He would have been better off taking all that cash that it cost him to do that and just lighting it on fire,"" she said. ""There's a saying in politics that you never punch down and so clearly what we're seeing here is a pathetic attempt by Gov. Newsom to take a swipe at our governor, who is now being known as America's governor, because he stands up for families and individuals and businesses.""

She added that ""60,000 Californians over the last three years now getting Florida driver's licenses because they're fleeing California because of oppression … if it wasn't so sad, it would be funny, but I mean, what do you expect when you have a guy who's related to Nancy Pelosi and has lower approval ratings than Joe Biden?""

newsmax,Abortion,14522,newsmax,"The idea of putting abortion clinics on federal lands, as some progressives want, is ""just insane,"" Rep. Nancy Mace said on Newsmax on Tuesday.

""Some of our national forests or nationally protected land. You're going to put abortion clinics on them?"" the South Carolina Republican said on Newsmax's ""National Report."" ""Because our country is so divided, it will be very hard for progressives to get what they want, which is why they're looking at ways to work around the rule of law, work around the rule of the Supreme Court, and put this on federal lands.""

But the idea of putting the clinics on federal lands ""goes to show you how crazy Joe Biden is, and his administration and the progressive left,"" said Mace.

Progressives ""have lost their minds over something that doesn't happen in most countries,"" she added. ""If you look at socialist Europe, abortion is banned after 12 to 15 weeks on average, if you're even able to have an abortion.""

But in the United States, where half the states have restrictions on abortion and half don't, Congress must take a role in deciding if there will be national restrictions as well, said Mace.

South Carolina has a law set to go into effect restricting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, but Biden and the administration are openly calling for a carve out of the filibuster to codify Roe and ensure access to abortion in all states.

Mace, though, said she does not think the move will succeed, noting that even when former President Barack Obama had a supermajority, he did not codify Roe.

""I don't think they're going to be able to do what they want to do, because it would require them to work together with Republicans, and Republicans are not going to go as far as a progressive left, who want abortion for any reason up until birth,"" said Mace. ""You've seen legislation in states like Virginia, where there was a delegate in Virginia just a few years ago, trying to allow abortion up until the day of birth and Virginia's former governor as well.""

Mace also on Tuesday commented on the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of West Virginia vs. EPA, in which the court agreed on limitations to the agency's scope, drawing fire from Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who called the court ""out of control,"" with the ruling.

Mace accused Warren of being out of control, not the court, and said Democrats are OK with protesters protesting outside the home of Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the Roe decision ""which is against the law.""

""Somebody's going to get hurt, and this has got to stop,"" Mace said. ""We need adults in the room, people who are willing to stand up and be strong and follow the rule of law in this country. You're not seeing it from these progressive senators, or even from the Joe Biden administration.""

newsmax,Abortion,14290,newsmax,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asserted on Sunday the Supreme Court has “lost legitimacy” with its Friday ruling overturning a nearly 50-year-old federal abortion right — and argued the high court needs more justices.

In an interview on ABC News’ “This Week,” the progressive Democrat ticked off several decisions by the high court that reflected its more conservative direction.

“This court has lost legitimacy,” she said. “They have burned whatever legitimacy they may still have had after their gun decision, after their voting decision, after their union decision. They just took the last of it and set a torch to it with the Roe v. Wade opinion. I believe we need to get some confidence back in our court, and that means we need more justices on the United States Supreme Court.”

According to Warren, Republicans “have been very overt about trying to get people through the court who didn't have a published record on Roe but who they knew, wink, wink, nod, nod, were going to be extremist on the issue of Roe v. Wade.”

“When Roe v. Wade first came down, there was a tiny minority that really put a lot of energy in effect for themselves and for Republicans, putting Roe on the ballot over and over,” Warren added.

“But on the ballot didn't mean try to get it through the Congress, because they knew they couldn't do that. They're not even close to having national support for that. So instead it was about getting extremist judges into the United States Supreme Court. And let's see how much credibility those justices have now.”

Warren argued individual rights have never been left to the states.

“The whole idea is that women are not second-class citizens,” she said.

And the government is not the one that will decide about the continuation of a pregnancy. There's no equivalent there for men. So what we believe is that access to abortion, like other medical procedures, should be available across the board to all people in this country.”

Going forward, Warren said, Democrats will be “laser focused” on November elections — naming Pennsylvania’s Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Wisconsin’s Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes in their Senate races.

“We bring them in, then we've got the votes, and we can protect every woman, no matter where she lives,” Warren said.",Abortion
newsmax,COVID,10923,newsmax,"Responding to news that Gov. Phil Murphy, D-N.J., will be lifting mask mandates for students in the state, Rep. Chris Smith told Newsmax on Monday that ""it's about time.""

""You know, children in school are shown to be the least at risk,” Smith, R-N.J., said on Newsmax’s ""National Report."" ""And yet we've had this, I think, very foolish mandate imposed upon them.""

Students in New Jersey have been required to wear masks while at school since September 2020, when most schools reopened after a four-month lockdown.

New Jersey will lift its school mask mandates in the second week of March, The New York Times reported Monday.

Mask wearing in schools has been one of the most fiercely debated issues of the COVID-19 pandemic, frequently pitting parents, school boards, teachers, and elected officials against each other in emotionally-charged exchanges about personal liberty, parental choice, learning losses and public health.

Murphy’s decision comes after Gov. Tom Wolf, D-Pa., dropped his state's school mask mandate last month, the Times reported.

Continuing on the subject of mandates, Smith said that COVID-19 vaccine mandates should also be scrapped.

""The same goes with vaccines,"" Smith said. ""They should be voluntary, not mandatory. For children especially, there's not a good body of evidence at all about its efficacy and safety, especially its safety.""

The Los Angeles Times reported that COVID-19 vaccines would be mandated for California students under a bill introduced Jan. 24.

If passed by the legislature and signed by the governor, California state Senate Bill 871 would add COVID-19 vaccines to California’s list of required shots to attend K-12 schools. Students would only be able to opt out if they receive a rare medical exemption.

During his appearance, Smith also spoke to the tension between Russia and Ukraine, saying that President Joe Biden's performance as a leader on the world stage is troubling.

""After Afghanistan, and the message that that sent, which is profound, and all in the negative, our European partners and our friends and allies are less likely to listen to and adhere to any kind of reported leadership by President Biden,"" Smith said. ""That's very serious. Remember, Crimea [in 2014] happened right after the Olympics, and I am very, very concerned with this build up that a war may be imminent.”

Concerning the Winter Olympic Games, Smith said that Beijing should not have been allowed to host.

""I'm the one, along with [Sen.] Marco Rubio, who wrote the IOC [International Olympic Committee] back in 2018 saying, 'Move the venue,'"" Smith said. ""Do not allow a genocidal regime under Xi Jinping, who has committed atrocities. He ought to be at The Hague for crimes against humanity and for genocide, not hosting the Olympic Games and getting a standing ovation.

""Now, I've chaired 75 congressional hearings on human rights abuses in China, I’ve written many resolutions on it. It is the worst it has been, under Xi Jinping.

Tenney said the administration should stop buying Russian oil, and shouild have taken steps to keep the U.S. energy independent.

""We still have the option on the table to impose sanctions on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin by not buying Russian oil, something that incredibly [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi agreed to yesterday,"" Tenney said on ""National Report."" ""But the problem is, if we're going to cut off Russian oil to the United States, we have to produce our own.""

That means bringing back the Keystone XL pipeline, Tenney said.

""Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg said this is off the table, but he's willing to negotiate and get oil from Iran,"" said Tenney, noting that Russia is one of the negotiators in restoring the Iran nuclear deal.

""This is insane that this administration is not looking at this clear-eyed and with common sense.""

Despite Pelosi saying she's interested in stopping Russian oil imports, Tenney said the speaker is ""not willing to unleash the abundant supplies that we have, even in my district in New York State, where some of the best shale reserves are right in the southern tier.""

""We are the only state in the nation that's not allowed to do safe, responsible, regulated gas drilling to tap into those resources for prosperity and to make us energy secure,"" Tenney said.

However, Tenney said that the only positive thing to come out of talks between Ukraine and Putin was the allowance of some channels through which women, children, and vulnerable people can leave Ukraine for Poland.

""It's heartwarming to see what a great ally Poland is,"" Tenney said. ""People are in stadiums, donating blood to help refugees and people that have been wounded in this absolutely murderous invasion of Ukraine.""

Tenney also discussed the moves to lift mask regulations including in New York City.

""We had the optic on the Nancy Pelosi under a lot of pressure from many of us, including me, and my colleagues said enough with this phony object of the mask mandate,"" Tenney said. ""So yes, this is continuing with New York City, the ground zero of liberal leftist misinformation.""

''This is nothing but a power grab by the board. And it's shameful, and it's going to be harmful to public safety,'' Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told Fox News Digital.

The board, he added, has progressive Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón ''in their back pocket.''

The board last week voted 4-0, with one member abstaining, to approve a proposal that would give the county personnel director overriding authority to discipline any employees who fail to comply with the requirement.

Supervisors Sheila Kuehl and Holly Mitchell introduced the motion, saying countywide compliance with the employee vaccine mandate ''remains a challenge four months after its issuance.''

Less than 60% of employees in the sheriff's department are in compliance with the vaccine mandate, and Villanueva has declined to enforce it among his deputies.

''Unsurprisingly, approximately 74% of the more than 5,000 COVID-19-related workers' compensation claims filed by county employees as of Jan. 29, 2022, have been filed by employees in the sheriff's department,'' according to the motion. ''This data illustrates vaccinations' vital role in limiting the spread of COVID-19 and thus, the urgent need to increase vaccination rates across the entire county workforce.''

Villanueva said the board couldn't care less about the opinion of the residents in reference to safety concerns.

''They're that powe- hungry in there, so walled off from normal life. While they were in the comfort and security of their homes during the pandemic, when there was no vaccine, our deputies were on the front lines out there answering calls for service. ... And now this board of supervisors wants to turn around and fire those very same people who sacrificed everything to keep public safety.

''It's just, it's really an immoral position these people have adopted, and just shame on every single one of them.''",COVID

Fauci was interviewed Sunday on CNN by Jim Acosta, who asked him, ""If Trump were to return to the White House as president, and COVID is still a threat or there is some other public health emergency, would you have confidence in his ability ... to deal with a pandemic of this nature? Would you want to stay on in your post?""

""Well, no to the second question,"" Fauci responded. ""The first question, if you look at the history of what the response was during the administration, I think at best you could say it wasn't optimal. And I think just history will speak for itself. I don't need to make any further comment about that, it's not productive.""

Fauci was the early face of the pandemic response during Trump's administration, but the two frequently clashed over messaging, and Trump eventually took over press briefings himself with Fauci becoming unseen. Trump once called him an ""idiot"" and publicly considered firing him.

Many on the right accuse Fauci of flip-flopping on messaging about masks during the pandemic and downplaying the possibility that COVID may have originated in China's Wuhan lab.

Conservatives were quick to welcome Fauci's words, according to the Daily Mail, which published a roundup of their tweets.

""Best possible endorsement for Trump in 2024,"" Sean Davis, CEO of The Federalist, tweeted. ""Good riddance to this corrupt, evil little elf.""

Political pundit Stephen L. Miller sarcastically chimed in, ""Stop encouraging Trump to run again.""

""The amount of arrogance stuffed into this tiny person is staggering. He won't serve under Trump because he'll be fired 30 seconds after the inauguration. Plus, he'll be 83. Just slink away, little man,"" said Boston radio host Gerry Callahan.

newsmax,COVID,11169,newsmax,"A former official in the Obama administration accused President Joe Biden on Thursday of being wrong on the subject of inflation by blaming rising rates on supply chain issues.

Steven Rattner, a former counselor to the Treasury secretary during the Obama administration, wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times that Biden was being misleading when talking about the recent inflation spike. Biden said in an interview with NBC News last week that global supply chain issues caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were the main cause for increased prices for consumers.

""Supply issues are by no means the root cause of our inflation. Blaming inflation on supply lines is like complaining about your sweater keeping you too warm after you've added several logs to the fireplace,"" Rattner wrote. ""The bulk of our supply problems are the product of an overstimulated economy, not the cause of it.""

During the interview, Biden specifically noted that a shortage of semiconductors was hurting auto manufacturing and causing a rise in car costs.

He told NBC, ""The reason for the inflation is the supply chains were cut off, meaning that the products, for example, automobiles — the lack of computer chips to be able to build those automobiles so they could function; they need those computer chips. They were not available.""

Rattner said that although there are ongoing supply chain issues, this inflation is primarily caused by large levels of demand due to increased consumer spending, possibly due to the multiple stimulus payments sent out during the pandemic.

""It's a classic economic case of 'too much money chasing too few goods,' resulting in both higher prices; and, given the extreme surge in demand, shortages,"" he said.",COVID

State budget negotiations under Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul are weighing dropping a ban on new casinos until 2023, and New York City is a potential location that figures to bring one big-dollar lobbying.

""I believe in New York City; I think we are going to come back,"" Bally's Corp. Chair Soo Kim, who grew up on Queens, told Politico.

There are two horse tracks with video-lottery terminals in the New York City area, MGM's Resorts World New York City in Queens and Empire City Casino in Yonkers, but they figure to be the first houses to benefit when lobbyists get gambling laws to permit a full-fledged casino in the city.

""We are ready to deliver thousands of new jobs for Westchester and the Bronx while generating $1 billion in new economic activity with a full gaming license,"" MGM wrote in a statement, according to Politico. ""Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts is ready to roar.""

New York City, with 20 million people and once a tourist capital before the COVID-19 pandemic, has had its residents take their gambling budgets to Atlantic City, New Jersey, or Native American Casinos in Connecticut, but all that tax income could help the city rebound from economic downturn from the pandemic.

""With a responsible approach to pursuing new casino licenses downstate, we have a unique and timely opportunity to put unemployed hospitality workers back to work while also giving our economy a much needed boost,"" New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council President Rich Maroko.

His union backs a plan for Resorts World at Aqueduct Racetrack to become into a full casino, once 2014's gambling law is relaxed before 2023's exclusive licenses on New York's upstate casino houses expire.

""It's going to happen soon enough anyway – if we're ready to do it and all the infrastructure is in place and the regulatory structure is in place, why not do it sooner?"" state Sen. Mike Gianaris, D-Queens, told Politico.

In addition to the $500 million initiation fee hurdle, regulatory and tax burdens, there is opposition expected, particularly for the most choice locations of Manhattan.

""My concern, representing Manhattan and Times Square is the neighborhoods which would be adjacent to any proposed casino and the impact,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, told Politico. ""Casinos can have negative externalities, to put it mildly.

""I oppose them strongly and generally have done so in the legislature. When it is in my Senate district, it is even a greater concern.""

University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley political science professor Clyde Barrow is skeptical New York City can make enough to overcome the costs of operation.

""The state is going to look to maximize net new revenues and net new job growth in making the decision on where to locate them,"" Barrow told Politico. ""When you put a casino in the middle of nowhere or in a small city, there are limited alternative entertainment venues competing against it.

""But when you put a casino in Manhattan or in Queens, you are competing against every other entertainment, amusement and recreation facility in that city, so it is a vastly more competitive market in which people have lots of other alternatives on how to spend their entertainment dollars.""

""We are seeing a gross number which is significantly higher than with Delta, and so that's pushing all the other numbers,"" Suarez told ""Fox News Sunday.""

Miami is expanding its testing and vaccination capabilities, said the mayor, and is seeing a correlation between people who are not vaccinated and who end up in the hospital.

""So what we are doing in the city of Miami, number one allowing people to get tested and expanding our testing capacities and are vaccination capacities and we are seeing a correlation between those that are hospitalized and those who are not vaccinated,"" he said.

His comments come after Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., tweeted claimed, ""there is no omicron hospital 'surge' in Florida,"" because people who are admitted for non-COVID reasons get tested"" and are ""counted as a COVID patient.""

He also maintained the majority of the covid patients in the state's hospitals are not there because of having COVID.

Suarez agreed there are many cases of people who come to hospitals with COVID, not because of it.

""The fact is, it's also not quite as high as it was at the peak, so I think we have to talk about this on a factual basis and try to depoliticize it as much as possible,"" Suarez said.

He also said, when you look at the number of deaths, Florida's Gov. Ron DeSantis' actions have done well.

'The state of Florida has significantly fewer deaths than, for example, New York on a per capita basis,"" Suarez added. ""We are dealing with this the very best that we can, and listen, many people who are not vaccinated and who are young and healthy are getting it. There's a high level of asymptomatic impact and effect, so they're not getting severe symptoms.""

Suarez has also differed with DeSantis on the topic of masks.

""I think the biggest issue was making sure that this did not harm the environment, particularly at a time where the unemployment rate was skyrocketing,"" he said. ""Now in the city of Miami, our unemployment rate is at 3.7%, which is almost 1% lower than the entire state. What we've implemented is pro-business policies that could keep people safe and I think using a mask was one of those.""

Florida and Miami-Dade have done all they can to keep schools open, and it is a ""tremendous concern when you see schools being closed"" in other cities, Suarez continued.

The mayor also discussed crime in his city, which he said has dropped the past year because of increased funding for police, at a time other cities have decreased their spending.

""I think we should also invest in technology and give them the tools to do their job better, and that's something we've done in Miami,"" he said. ""We have a variety of different technologies that allow us to solve crime and allow our officers to be more effective at doing their job, and we've seen the results, and I think it is something that can be replicated across America. Everybody deserves to be safe.""",COVID
newsmax,COVID,16957,newsmax,"Members of the conservative Freedom Caucus are calling on leaders within the GOP to delay passage of the annual defense bill until after the new year if the COVID-19 vaccine mandate for service members is not lifted, The Hill reported.

Speculating on a Republican majority post-midterms in either the House or the Senate, the group says it can ""rework"" the legislation in January.

""Congressional Republicans still have the opportunity to stand in defense of our Nation's military — if we stand united,"" the group wrote in a letter to Republican party leaders Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday.

""Just as they did in July,"" the group continued, ""Democrats will need Republican votes to pass the NDAA, and the House Freedom Caucus urges all Republicans to hold the line to force Democrats to reverse the policies of President Biden undermining our Nation's military and its combat readiness, starting with the vaccine mandate.""

On Tuesday, the Senate began debate on its National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The final vote is expected after the midterm elections. The Senate vote would then reconcile with the House version of the NDAA, which passed in June, The Hill adds, ""in a 329-101 vote, with 39 Democrats and 62 Republicans voting against the legislation.""

In addition to the Freedom Caucus's opposition to the NDAA over vaccine mandates, the group also opposed the funding bill regarding the ""prioritization of 'diversity' and 'inclusion' over combat readiness.""

The caucus also made it a point in a list of one of its four demands regarding the NDAA that a special inspector general should investigate the United States' involvement in Ukraine.

""Republicans,"" the letter continued, ""must demand that the NDAA: (1) fully repeals the vaccine mandate and allows service members involuntarily discharged to be reinstated without penalty; (2) ends the contamination of our military by radical Leftist 'woke' ideologies and the prioritization of politics over combat readiness; (3) halts wasteful spending on 'Green New Deal' pet climate projects; and (4) establishes a Special Inspector General on U.S. involvement in Ukraine.""

The Freedom Caucus says if those demands are not met, Republicans should delay passage of the funding bill until after the start of the next Congress when the group expects to have ""a new Republican Majority to comprehensively rework the NDAA to serve America's service members instead of Leftist political agendas.""

""Who appointed Twitter to be the judge of what is information and misinformation?"" the Georgia Republican said on Newsmax's ""National Report."" ""I'm elected to serve and represent over 700,000 people in my district. Twitter was not elected and Twitter has no authority over the government.""

Greene was banned after posting tweets deemed to be misinformation concerning the COVID vaccines, but she said Wednesday the information she shared was from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-managed Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

""The real issue everyone needs to be asking is why hasn't the Biden administration led an investigation into this massive amount of deaths that people are reporting on VAERS?"" Greene said.

 

 ""That is what I was tweeting about, as well as other easily verifiable facts in this big long thread that I tweeted, that apparently Twitter is saying that they permanently banned me for.""

But, she continued, if the government and President Joe Biden are going to mandate vaccines, ""then why aren't they researching reported deaths?""

Greene also demanded to know why the VAERS data would be considered ""misinformation.""

The congresswoman also insisted that she and former President Donald Trump ""are the only two elected Republicans to be kicked off of Twitter,"" but they remain ""two of the most popular Republicans in the country.""

Several other Republicans have been suspended on social media, but have not faced permanent suspensions, according to Ballotpedia.

""My polling is amazing, and I'm so grateful for all the support of the people in my district, but also across the country,"" said Greene. ""It's perhaps the establishment or those that sit on the board at Twitter and maybe some of the Republicans and Democrats that they donate to those are the ones that need to pay attention and care more about what the American people think and feel and what they want out of the people that they elect to serve in government.""

Greene said the first place she went to after the Twitter ban was to rival site Gettr, which she described as a ""great public social media platform as well where truth is not censored.""

She said she's asking the entire Republican conference and party members nationwide to leave Twitter.

""Why give them the power to continue to censor our voices and to basically keep duct tape over our mouths when they don't like our political speech?"" she said. ""I love the alternatives. I think that's the best way that we can solve problems and I'm grateful to the people that create these other platforms.""

Greene, meanwhile, has been fined almost $90,000 for refusing to wear a mask on the House floor, and she said she'll keep refusing the mandate.

""I think it's obvious that the high amount of cases and how COVID has continued in very shutdown areas (show) that masking doesn't work,"" she said. ""There are studies that show that as well as vaccinated people continuing to catch COVID, and that's greatly concerning to me.""

Instead, she said she's a ""big believer in life-saving treatments"" and would rather see that be the path to follow rather than the use of mask and vaccine mandates.

""I'm very much against masks, especially for children,"" she said. ""I think that it's awful to mask children when they virtually have no threat from COVID … so, I take the fines on the House floor. I'm up to almost $90,000 in fines on the House floor because I believe as a representative, in order to represent the people, I have to be willing to do it myself.""

A full 70% of Americans agree with the sentiment that ""it's time we accept that COVID is here to stay, and we just need to get on with our lives,"" including 78% of those who report having gotten the coronavirus, and 65% of those who say they have not been infected.

The survey finds a majority of the public continues to back some preventative measures, but not others.

For example, 52% support instituting, or reinstituting, face mask and social distancing guidelines in their home state, which is less than December (55%) and September (63%), but is the same as last July (52%) when COVID-19's spread was at its lowest ebb so far.

However, only 43% back requiring people to show proof of vaccination in order to work in an office or other setting where they are around other people after support was at 53% in September and 46% last month.

""We still see public support for maintaining some degree of public safety around COVID,"" Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said.

• Half, 50%, are either very (23%) or somewhat (27%) concerned about catching one of the new COVID variants. Even so, 37% remain unlikely to ever get a booster shot, including 17% who remain opposed even to getting the initial vaccination.
• Just 43% say President Joe Biden has done a good job on handling the pandemic, while 53% say he has done a bad job — the first time his rating on this metric has been underwater since he took office.

Despite Biden stating the end of the pandemic during the interview, his administration has not ended the emergency declaration by former President Donald Trump in 2020, or the requirement that all federal employees, including the military be vaccinated against the disease.

In July, the National Guard Association reported that unvaccinated Guard members would not be able to participate in training sessions, drills, or activities that generated pay or retirement credits, impacting up to 40,000 troops.

“Maintaining readiness continues to be among the U.S. Army’s highest priorities,"" the U.S. Army Public Affairs Department said in a statement at the time. “Soldiers who refuse the vaccination order without an approved or pending exemption request are subject to adverse administrative actions, including flags, bars to service, and official reprimands.

''I still think that there is a reasonable chance they won't [invade],'' Paul said on ''Spicer & Co.'' ''Nobody knows the future rather than Putin, probably, but I still think there is a reasonable chance they won't invade.''

Paul reacted to comments made by President Joe Biden earlier in the day as he provided an update on the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

Biden said that Russia is claiming to have withdrawn some of its estimated 150,000 troops encircling Ukraine, but the U.S. has not been able to confirm the troop movements.

''The Russian defense minister reported today that some military units are leaving their positions near Ukraine,'' Biden said. ''That would be good, but we have not yet verified that.''

Despite the report, Biden said Russian troops remain in a ''very threatening position.''

Biden said his administration has been engaged in ''nonstop diplomacy'' to try to stem the threat of an invasion of Ukraine, and said he spoke directly to Putin over the weekend.

While pursuing diplomacy, Biden said the United States is ready to impose severe sanctions and will stand with NATO allies should Russia move into Ukraine.

Paul said that diplomacy needs to have a carrot as well as a stick to work in a situation like this and said that imposing sanctions before Russia moved would do little to change what Putin plans to do.

''I think there has to be both stick and carrot,'' Paul said. ''The stick is potential sanctions. If you put on sanctions now, when will you remove them when they don't attack? Well, they haven't attacked yet, so it has to be a threat of what we do if you do something. If you put on the sanctions in advance, there's no sort of endpoint for removing the sanctions.''

Paul also said that because there is so much interdependence on energy between Russia and European nations, they may have more leverage against Putin.

''Ultimately the real leverage here is with Germany and with Europe,'' Paul said, ''They by 30% to 40% of their natural gas from Russia. We buy very little, so it's not as if we can threaten not to buy their natural gas or to put sanctions on. I don't think it will affect their behavior.

At the recent St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Margarita Simonyan, editor in chief of the Russian state-controlled media outlet RT, said she has heard from several people in Moscow that ''all our hope is in the famine.''

''Here is what it means,'' Simonyan continued. ''It means that the famine will start now and they will lift the sanctions and be friends with us, because they will realize that it's necessary.''

Various sanctions against Russia were levied around Feb. 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Nearly four full months later, the military conflict continues between the neighboring countries.
• The United States placed a ban on all imports of Russian oil and gas, while also targeting the country's largest lenders.
• The United Kingdom has been phasing out imports of Russian oil.
• Germany halted plans to open the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia.
• And the European Union has promised to phase out imports of coal from Russia by August.

The widespread sanctions have also hit prominent individuals, businesses and banks, while big companies such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Coca-Cola have completely withdrawn from Russia as a sign of protest against Putin's war.

Russia, meanwhile, has been accused of blocking Ukraine's ports and laying the groundwork for a global food crisis.

According to the United Nations, the Russia-Ukraine war, Russia's seizure of foreign farmland and the Black Sea blockade have exacerbated the food crisis in Ukraine, driving up famine levels in that country.

Putin has reportedly pledged to lift the blockade if Western sanctions from Russia's ''special military operation'' are removed in due time.

''Most important of all, we need to end the war in Ukraine,'' António Guterres, the U.N. secretary‑general, told the Security Council on May 19, while lamenting how the food distribution networks are struggling.

Sara Menker, founder and chief executive officer of Gro Intelligence, which provides actionable insights across the economy, climate and agriculture, said that before the war, Russia and Ukraine provided nearly one-third of the world's wheat exports.

The countries were also among the top five global exporters of corn, she said.

For now, though, all Ukrainian ports remain closed amid the conflict.

A representative of Ukraine reportedly told the Security Council that Putin's war threatens some 400 million people globally who rely on Ukrainian grain exports.

Russia is also seizing Ukrainian grain for its own consumption or to sell it illegally on international markets, according to the unnamed official.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell Fontelles, has accused Putin of deliberately attempting to ''create hunger in the world in order to put pressure ... on the EU.''

newsmax,Climate Change,11360,newsmax,"President Joe Biden is to blame for Russia's power play because he reversed Donald Trump's energy policies, says former Trump National Security Adviser K.T. McFarland.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ""can do whatever he wants"" with oil at $100 a barrel, McFarland said Thursday during an appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, according to the Daily Mail.

""If oil is at $40 a barrel, which it was when President Trump left office, the Russians are broke,"" she said.

""They can't afford to go to war. War is expensive.""

Former President Trump's energy independence policy, she said, kept Putin in check.

Biden, she said, ""immediately shut down the American energy industry oil and natural gas. The energy that we were exporting to other countries — that stopped as well — and what happened? The price of oil went sky high.""

""Vladimir Putin is rich, and he gets to choose when to invade.""

In an interview with Fox News, McFarland said Biden should be focusing on the U.S. becoming the world's ""energy superpower"" in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""Biden should have said to the American people, 'I'm reversing course, and I'm going to re-open American energy production, oil, natural gas, the Keystone Pipeline, liquified natural gas terminals,'"" she said, adding that he should have told the Europeans: ""I got your back, I will give you energy security. Don't rely on that unreliable Russian stuff. We will sell you at a good price.""

""Cheap, reliable, clean, American natural gas,"" she said. ""And then he should have turned to the Russians and said, 'I am going to pump a lot of oil from American companies. I'm going to get the Saudis and our Arab allies to pump a lot of oil and natural gas. We are going to drive that price right down and you're going to be bankrupt.'""

""Here's the thing,"" she said. ""We have it. Donald Trump got us there, and American ingenuity and technical people and engineers, and they figured out a way to get oil and natural gas out of rocks, and it turns out we are sitting on the biggest reservoir of oil and natural gas of anywhere in the world.""

She added: ""But Americans just do their job. Get out of the way, let that energy industry work, and then we become the energy superpower, not just for North America, but for the world.""

On ""Spicer & Co.,"" Bice laid out the decisions President Joe Biden and his White House have made prior to what some are predicting to be a harsh winter season for U.S. homeowners.

""The Northeast has a real issue with pipelines. They are unwilling to allow permitting or just flat-out refuse to lay pipe. And because of that, you had [Sen.] Elizabeth Warren [D-Mass.] several months ago write a letter to the administration asking them to stop LNG [liquefied natural gas] export shipments,"" Bice said.

""I have folks back home, one in particular who owns a drilling company,"" she continued. ""He used to be able to get a permit in six months. It is taking 12 to 18 [months] at this point.""

The Oklahoma congresswoman, who is seeking reelection, said that the most significant problem with the Biden energy plan is that it affects ""long-term production and delivery of natural gas and oil across the country.""

""The pipeline permitting issue is first and foremost,"" Bice said. ""And to that end, we need to sort of recognize that pipelines are the safest, most efficient way to transport across the country.

""You have a trucker shortage right now. You have a discussion of a rail strike this last week. So, making sure that we are laying pipeline for the future is important, and the farther we fall behind in that, the further the impact it's going to have long term.""

According to Bice, the U.S. could be facing ""a 50% increase in heating and electricity bills that are coming this winter,"" with a potential 90% increase in Oklahoma. She emphasized that the coming increase will hit low-income families hardest.

newsmax,Climate Change,11635,newsmax,"Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, rejected the Biden administration's arguments blaming lowered oil production on companies not using licenses already approved for thousands of locations.

He accused President Joe Biden of living in a ""completely unreal world,"" speaking Tuesday to Newsmax.

""Listening to the president say what he just did that he was not holding this back, I thought I was back in the State of the Union message that we had the other night with all the fiction,"" Babin, who said he represents a district with more petrochemical refining facilities than any other member of Congress, told ""American Agenda.""

While announcing the United States' ban on Russian oil Tuesday, Biden promised he would do all he could to minimize price hikes in the United States, but said lifting economic regulations would not boost U.S. energy production, reports NPR.

He added, oil and gas companies ""can be drilling right now, yesterday, last week, last year,"" as they have already leased millions of acres of U.S. land and received permits to drill, but have decided not to use them.

Biden's comments follow those made by White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who argued during Monday's press briefing, ""there are 9,000 unused approved drilling permits,"" telling reporters they should ask oil companies why they are not drilling.

""Just because he says it doesn't make it so,"" Babin said of Biden's comments. ""He is most definitely certainly holding back domestic production.""

He added he is glad Biden has decided to ban Russian oil, but still, ""he has to unleash American energy, and he has to do it immediately.""

Further, said Babin, information must be released on the anti-energy agenda being pushed by the White House and Democrats.

""They're controlled by this radical wing,"" he said. ""They want everyone on electric vehicles. They want everybody off of fossil fuels. That's their whole point. But to stop Russia from financing their invasion of Ukraine, he's got to end this federal freeze on all oil and new gas projects … he's got to expedite approval of all pipeline energy development, and when he says he's not going to reauthorize the Keystone pipeline, it tells you that he's not serious about this.""

Biden must also start talking to energy producers and ""unshackle states like Texas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and New Mexico,"" Babin said. ""Under President [Donald] Trump, we were energy independent, a net exporter, and he has killed that. He has squandered that in less than a year.""

Meanwhile, Babin said he knows the U.S. oil companies cannot immediately turn on their systems to start producing oil again, ""but there are things that need to be done to get the ball rolling so that we can replace this Russian oil that we've been hooked on under the Biden administration.""

""The president keeps forecast, keeps predicting that Russia is going to invade,"" Kudlow told Sunday's ""The Cats Roundtable"" on WABC 770 AM-N.Y. ""Why he keeps making these predictions is utterly beyond me.

""He is allowing Putin to control this and that really bothers me, that runs contrary to American interests. Obviously, Biden is not an America First guy.""

Kudlow said overdue economic pressure needs to be put on Putin in the way of a deadline to impose sanctions.

""Set a March 1 deadline: 'If your troops do not return to their proper barracks, then we will, as of March 1, impose strict across-the-board banking and energy sanctions'; just like that,"" Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.

""In the aftermath of the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan America looks like a weak sister. Biden is a weak president. Putin is taking advantage of that.""

This is not just about Ukraine and NATO, Kudlow warned, because other territories around the world will be next.

""If we let Putin do this scot-free, John, then China will figure out after the Olympics, 'Why can't they take over Taiwan?'"" Kudlow said, noting the world is watching how we .

""I'm suggesting to you: The lack of deadlines, the lack of clarity, the lack of sanctions has done damage here.""

Behind all of this is money, riches, energy, and oil – and not necessarily just NATO admission as Putin has claimed as a pretext for his border buildup. If fact, Putin can now enrich his country and damage America even by self-imposing sanctions, according to Kudlow.

""If Russia says we are not going to put any natural gas out into Europe, that will drive oil energy prices sky high, the price of oil to $150 [per barrel], and will have grave economic consequences for the United States,"" Kudlow said.

Biden's ""waging a jihad against fossil fuels"" for Green New Deal progressives is proving costly for wealth and security worldwide, Kudlow concluded.

""While the world needs more oil and the world needs more natural gas, literally, to survive, Biden is doing everything he can through the regulatory arm in Washington to stop it: Now, to me that is incredibly stupid,"" he said, pointing to the ""closing down the XL Pipeline but allowing Nord Stream 2 to reopen.""

""If the Senate passes a CR [continuing resolution], we have to keep [the] government open,"" the California Democrat said on Wednesday.

Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Senate Democratic leadership initially negotiated the deal after the caucus needed him to pass President Joe Biden's massive social and climate spending package in July.

Now, Manchin is pushing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., to make good on their end of the bargain: easing red tape and investing in domestic energy infrastructure.

The only problem is some Republicans have voiced concerns with Manchin's specific proposal, which seeks to speed up the environmental review process, restrict states' ability to block some federal projects and complete the Mountain Valley Pipeline.

And there appears to be substantial House resistance, too. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., appeared to contradict Pelosi on Wednesday, claiming that ""the speaker has said she was not part of that agreement.

""I'm not critical of the agreement. I have questions about it, concerns about it. But having said that, this is not our agreement,"" Hoyer stated.

""I'm all for that, ban it — ban the oil coming from Russia, yeah,"" Pelosi told reporters at her weekly news conference Thursday.

Republicans have called out Biden's energy policy, particularly on U.S. oil imports and buying Russian oil amid Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, as effectively ""funding Putin's war machine.""

Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters this week that ""40% going into Europe, almost 10% into the United States of America, we are importing Russian energy. This needs to stop. We are funding Putin's war machine.""

While the ban on Russian oil has not been put in place, Biden says ""nothing is off the table"" as Putin's invasion of Ukraine extends into a second week.

The Biden administration has struggled with inflation, especially the price of gasoline, which has shot up over $5 per gallon in some parts of the country.

""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,"" White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday on Air Force One. ""That would raise prices at the gas pump for Americans and pad Putin's profits.""

Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., are talking about moving legislation on blocking Russian oil imports.

""We've talked about energy and coming from a state that's rich in energy, we can help an awful lot if they ask us to,"" Manchin wrote in a statement. ""I've said today, I think that we should ban the amount of product we're buying from Russia to set a good example; we're buying about 600,000 barrels a day. We haven't ceased that.

The collapse came hours before President Joe Biden was to visit the city to press for his $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which includes bridge maintenance.

""@POTUS has been told of the bridge collapse in Pittsburgh,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted. ""Our team is in touch with state and local officials on the ground as they continue to gather information about the cause of the collapse.""

""@POTUS is grateful to the first responders who rushed to assist the drivers who were on the bridge at the time,"" she added in an ensuing tweet. ""The president will proceed with trip planned for today and will stay in touch with officials on the ground about additional assistance we can provide.""

There were minor injuries from the collapse but no fatalities, said authorities, who also said they were flying drones to make sure no one is under any collapsed sections.

Police reported the span, on Forbes Avenue over Fern Hollow Creek in Frick Park, came down just before 7 a.m.

A photo from the scene showed a commuter bus upright on a section of the collapsed bridge.

A KDKA television photo showed several vehicles piled in the rubble of the collapsed roadway at the bottom of a wooded gully.

City officials said the collapse caused a gas leak but the gas has since been shut off.

Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones said three or four vehicles were involved in the collapse and there were 10 minor injuries with three brought to the hospital. None of the injuries were life-threatening, Jones said.

""It sounded like a snow plow,"" a witness told KDKA, calling the timing on the day of Biden's visit ""an amazing coincidence.""

In Pittsburgh, the Democrat president will tour Mill 19, a former steel mill building now serving as a research and development hub, before hailing the U.S. economy's strong recovery from the pandemic, the White House said.

""The president will talk about the remarkable economic progress we’ve made over his first year in office — including the fastest single year of job growth in American history, the biggest unemployment drop on record and, as we learned on Thursday, the fastest economic growth in 2021 in almost four decades,"" a White House official said.

Biden, returning to the site of his first campaign event in 2019, will tout the creation of 367,000 manufacturing jobs since he took office one year ago, and passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill — a rare bipartisan victory in a deeply divided U.S. Congress.

The president also plans to talk about his push to rebuild American competitiveness and beat China in a race to dominate the global economy, the official said.

In recent days, General Motors said it would invest $7 billion in Michigan to expand electric vehicle production and Intel said it would invest up to $100 billion to build a chip-maker in Ohio.

newsmax,Climate Change,12221,newsmax,"Connecticut U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has $7.5 million in campaign cash and enviable name recognition after decades in public office, but Republicans in this Democratic-leaning state still see an opportunity to win a U.S. Senate seat after a roughly 30-year drought.

Top state Republicans are touting Themis Klarides, the former GOP leader in the state House of Representatives, as a formidable challenger with the best chance of capitalizing on the strong national headwinds facing Democrats this election year.

State Democrats remain confident Blumenthal, 76, will win a third six-year term. But if Klarides receives her party's endorsement in May, it will mark the first time Blumenthal has faced a challenge from such a well-known state politician. Klarides served more than two decades in the General Assembly, representing Derby, Orange and Woodbridge, and was the first woman to lead the House Republican caucus before retiring in 2021.

The 56-year-old lawyer, former model and bodybuilder who worked as a “ring girl” for the WWE while studying for the bar exam, initially considered running for governor. She announced her pivot to the Senate race in January, saying she believes she can win over voters with her moderate stances on social issues, such as support for abortion and gay rights, and conservative views on fiscal issues.

“I’ve talked to a lot of unaffiliateds and a lot of Democrats that are really disenchanted with Sen. Blumenthal; disenchanted that he follows party line and he’s partisan in whatever he does,” she said. ”He has not put Connecticut first, and his time has come to retire.""

Blumenthal has publicly avoided commenting on the race, telling The Associated Press — after a recent visit to Poland to learn about the Ukraine war — that he's focused on doing his job. He has cosponsored bills to limit the purchase of Russian energy and seize luxury assets tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“There will be plenty of time to talk about the campaign,"" he said.

However, in fundraising appeals, Blumenthal warns his supporters he's “up against radical Trump-loyalist opponents who want to flip this seat” and says his campaign needs help to ensure Democratic control of the Senate: “With everything from reproductive rights to voting rights to climate justice and more on the line, falling short is not an option.”

Klarides has been both critical and supportive of former President Donald Trump over the years, and said while she has heard from his supporters already, she expects to benefit more from voters' general frustration.

National Republicans have not officially weighed in on Connecticut's Senate race yet, considering there's still a potential primary. But at least two independent super PACs, which can raise unlimited sums of money, have been formed, signaling that outside groups are interested. One is backing Klarides and the other is supporting Leora Levy, a conservative Republican from Greenwich who is the state's Republican National Committeewoman and holds other party positions.

Other Republicans vying for the party's endorsement include Peter Lumaj, a conservative Republican and attorney from Fairfield who has previously run for statewide office; Robert Hyde of Canton, a 2019 congressional candidate who was asked to end that bid by top Republicans following vulgar tweets; John Flynn of Norwalk, a carpenter, painter and former state legislative candidate; and small business owner Nicholas Connors of New Canaan.

Bryan Cafferelli, a member of the Republican State Central Committee, is among those who have urged Republicans to “unify around Themis” and avoid a potentially damaging primary.

Ben Proto, the state's GOP chair, said President Joe Biden’s slumping approval ratings will boost all Republican candidates in Connecticut, even against a high vote-getter like Blumenthal. He likened the situation to the 1994 midterms, when the GOP took control of Congress and won the Connecticut governor’s race.

“There’s clearly a wave coming,” he said, tying Blumenthal to the Biden administration's policies on coronavirus mandates, rising inflation and high gas prices. Blumenthal has proposed suspending the federal gas tax.

Republicans are also likely to attack Blumenthal for attending a December event with ties to the Communist Party. He has said he was not aware of the affiliation.

Blumenthal’s last tight contest was in 2010, his first run for U.S. Senate. Republican Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive, spent $50 million on the race. McMahon’s camp had boasted it was responsible for reporting in The New York Times revealing Blumenthal repeatedly told audiences he served in Vietnam, when he actually remained stateside with the Marine Reserve during the war. Blumenthal apologized, telling voters he “misspoke” and never intended to mislead anyone. While in office, Trump frequently called Blumenthal derogatory names referencing the issue.

In Connecticut, the GOP faces a challenge when it comes to the numbers. As of October 2021, there were fewer than 465,000 active registered Republicans compared to more than 825,00 active Democrats and 930,000 active unaffiliated voters. Meanwhile, Blumenthal's supporters say the former U.S. attorney, who began his political career in the General Assembly in 1984 and later served an unprecedented five terms as state attorney general, has built up a tremendous amount of goodwill.

Nancy DiNardo, chair of the state's Democratic Party, said she isn't worried at all about Blumenthal.

“The people of Connecticut know the job he has done and appreciate the work that he has done for Connecticut and its citizens,” she said. “He did a phenomenal job as attorney general, and he continues to do a phenomenal job as a U.S. senator.""",Climate Change

""We need to be focusing on those technologies. We need to be invested in those technologies, like hypersonic missiles, the things that really are important for us to be to continue to be able to defend ourselves and to make sure that freedom remains around the world.""

Ferguson said the increased amount for the military in the budget will actually shrink compared to past years due to high inflation and food costs.

""When you look at that, when you look at both the customer inflation as (it) relates to fuel and food with our military, it is actually shrinking our budget. The spending is not there,"" he said. ""Then if you if you look at the Green New Deal initiatives, these are expensive, unproven things that have nothing to do with the readiness and the continuation of the narrative of the Biden administration.

Democrats hope the trip will boost the president's poor poll numbers and draw attention to his achievements. But some candidates for Congress worry that campaigning with Biden will hurt them in the Nov. 8 election, according to more than a dozen interviews with senior Democrats and local campaign officials in battleground states including Pennsylvania and Arizona.

Biden, whose latest approval rating is 40%, is polling lower than most, if not all, Democrat candidates in competitive races, often by double digits, Democratic pollsters said.

The trip, the latest effort to reset his presidency, will test the limits of Biden's influence in a party that has shown flashes of disloyalty in recent weeks. Some Democratic members of Congress have questioned whether Biden, at 79 already the oldest U.S. president, should run for reelection in 2024.

As they consider campaigning with him, Democrat candidates will closely watch whether Biden can move public opinion on his tour. On the plus side, Biden can share good news about recent legislative victories on climate change, gun control, and boosting domestic microprocessor production along with a Kansas victory on abortion rights.

""Sure it was a great month, but the jury is still out whether it actually made a difference or whether it's just too late,"" said one senior Democrat.

Meanwhile, opposition Republicans have unified around attacking Biden despite the party's internal divisions over former President Donald Trump and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Right-wing media, elected officials, and Trump have hammered a message that the White House has struggled to combat: Biden and his policies are responsible for record inflation, and he's old, doddering, and confused.

While Biden's defenders note that inflation is higher in some other countries and say he is undiminished, some candidates worry they may face awkward questions at events about whether they support the president's reelection. Their answers could serve as fodder for Republican rivals, sources said.

Democrat candidate for U.S. Senate Tim Ryan is running a populist campaign in Ohio against Trump-backed Republican J.D. Vance. The state has shifted hard to Republicans in recent elections, but polls show the race is a toss-up.

In July, Ryan, who currently holds a seat in the U.S. House, cited scheduling conflicts for skipping a Biden economic speech in Cleveland and has dodged questions about whether Biden should run again. Ryan would only consider appearing with Biden under limited circumstances, an official with the campaign effort told Reuters.

The official, for example, noted that Biden is expected to return to Ohio in coming weeks for the groundbreaking of an Intel plant that will eventually provide 3,000 jobs and get a big boost from the recently passed CHIPS Act, which aids the semiconductor industry.

""That is something Tim Ryan would likely attend with Biden. The messaging and politics are aligned,"" the official said.

Ryan campaign spokesperson Izzi Levy said she could not comment on his plans related to his congressional work. But regarding political events with Biden, she said, ""We have not asked him to campaign in Ohio and have no plans to do so.""

The Nov. 8 elections will determine whether Democrats retain their slim majorities in the House and Senate, or Republicans gain control. There are 43 competitive House races and seven Senate races, according to a Reuters analysis of data from three nonpartisan research groups on the competitiveness of U.S. elections. The White House thinks it can make gains in the Senate despite expected losses in the House.

Biden will speak at a Democratic National Committee event in Maryland on Thursday, his first political rally in months. It will serve as the kickoff to his midterm push. Democrats at the top of the ticket in Maryland are largely running against Trump-aligned opponents who face an uphill battle in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one.

Democrats in competitive races across the country say they are eager to see Biden hit the road and combat Republican attacks by boasting about a string of legislative achievements that include historic bipartisan bills on gun control and infrastructure along with more partisan achievements on climate change and health care. Officials frequently use the adage that a rising tide lifts all boats.

""If Biden can lift his poll numbers, it helps all Democrats,"" a Democratic pollster involved in Pennsylvania races said.

In Pennsylvania, campaign officials say a Biden visit is unnecessary – and potentially risky – because Democrats have early leads over Republican candidates viewed as flawed. Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano is a Trump-backed election-denier who attended the Jan. 6 rally in Washington while Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz is struggling in early polls amid questions about his ties to the state.

""We hope the president comes to the state, but we are not sure how much the Democratic candidates will be joining him. At this point, it doesn't make much sense,"" said one senior Democratic official involved in the governor's race.

Josh Shapiro, the Democrat candidate for governor in Pennsylvania, has appeared with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris separately this year. Manuel Bonder, a campaign spokesman, said Shapiro ""will continue welcoming President Biden to his home state.""

Jennifer Holdsworth, a Democratic strategist, called the decision by some Democrats to distance themselves from Biden a ""colossal mistake.""

""This has been a monumentally consequential administration. Voters don't care about the politics of the moment, they care about results and this administration has delivered,"" Holdsworth said.",Economy
newsmax,Economy,15652,newsmax,"Conservative commentators on Twitter took issue with a new CNN analysis attempting to spin a steady decline from record gas prices as a ""$100-a-month raise"" or ""tax cut.""

In the article published Friday, CNN Business senior writer Chris Isidore argues that the ""steady drop in gas prices over the last few months has turned into an unexpected form of economic stimulus.""

""The impact of the extra cash could be a substantial boost to an economy that is showing signs of consumers pulling back on purchasing nonessential items, such as clothing, electronics and household goods,"" he continued.

Isidore's suggestion comes as the average price of gas has declined $1.10, or 22%, since its height of $5.02 per gallon in mid-June. According to data from AAA, the current national average stands at around $3.92 per gallon.

However, a slate of conservatives called out the narrative of Isidore's article. Washington Free Beacon reporter Chuck Ross went as far as to call CNN ""State TV,"" adding that the recent firing of news anchor Brian Stelter ""won't fix that place.""

Several commentators also noted that gas still stands substantially higher than when former President Donald Trump was in office.

""Or, think of it as gas still being more than 60% more expensive than it was when Biden became president,"" tweeted former CNN contributor Doug Heye.

Republican researcher Tommy Pigott wrote that he fixed the headline: ""The next time you stop at a gas station, think of it as an over $100-a-month tax hike. Or maybe an over $100-a-month pay cut compared to gas prices when Joe Biden took office.""",Economy
newsmax,Economy,15307,newsmax,"Republicans are fortifying as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., prepares to ram through his massive $730 billion climate and social spending package this weekend, The Hill reported.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Friday that Republicans will ensure a series of procedural votes to be held on the bill, known colloquially as a ""vote-a-rama,"" will ""be like hell"" for the Democrats.

""They deserve this. As much as I admire [Sen.] Joe Manchin [D-W.Va.] and [Sen. Kyrsten] Sinema [D-Ariz.] for standing up to the radical left at times, they're empowering legislation that will make the average person's life more difficult,"" Graham said.

His comments came after Schumer announced his intention to push the Inflation Reduction Act forward after coming to separate agreements with moderate colleagues Manchin and Sinema over the past two weeks.

The vote-a-rama method Schumer is using, which is permitted only for appropriations bills, lets Democrats pass their package with a mere majority rather than the normally required 60 votes, while simultaneously bypassing the need to eliminate the filibuster.

In response, Republicans are preparing to line up a series of votes to pressure Democrats on critical issues as the November election lingers. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said during a recent press conference that the party will focus primarily on ""energy, inflation, [the] border and crime.""

Some Republicans are hopeful that they can add amendments and tank the entire bill, although they worry that Democrats might introduce a ""wraparound"" amendment, which could wipe out any amendments adopted during the vote-a-rama.

In a Friday press conference, Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., questioned whether Manchin and Sinema would vote for such an amendment.

""In the American Rescue Plan, they voted for a wraparound amendment and so felt like they were misled by their leadership at the time that they would never vote for one of those again,"" Thune pointed out.",Economy
newsmax,Economy,11691,newsmax,"President Joe Biden has pushed his ""buy American"" agenda, but he doesn't want to follow that policy when it comes to buying oil and gas produced in the United States because his administration is ""very beholden to the environmental left,"" Sen. James Lankford said Thursday on Newsmax.

""They're running the White House at this point,"" the Oklahoma Republican said on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America."" ""Their goal is to reduce energy production in the United States, knowing full well that we have to have that energy from somewhere, but they want to be able to stand up and crow and say the United States has reduced our carbon footprint.""

That comes while oil is bought from other places, including Russia, but to the environmentalists, the other countries can have a ""bad environmental score"" as long as a good score is achieved in the United States, and that is ""irrational,"" said Lankford.

""If you're going to talk about clean production, no one produces oil cleaner than the United States of America, so it's nonsensical policy,"" the senator added.

Lankford also commented on the Labor Department's report released Thursday showing the nation's inflation rate is now at 7.9% or the largest spike seen since 1982, pointing out that the inflation growth can't be blamed on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

""People need to remember, that's the inflation index going up before the war that happened in Ukraine,"" said Lankford. ""This is the Biden policies. This is what he put into place last March when everyone told him not to dump $2 trillion into a growing economy, when they did that, anyway. It causes inflation. Inflation feeds inflation. It's very hard to be able to stop and the American people are going to continue to suffer from this.""

It's also ""spin"" to blame the growing prices on gasoline and other goods on Russia or President Vladimir Putin, said Lankford. ""They're hoping everyone forgets the last year and how much prices rose all last year.""

He added: ""All the problems that we've had in the last year are based on their policies, and most Americans don't know because we don't track the inflation in other countries. Japan has not experienced this. South Korea hasn't, Australia hasn't, the U.K., Germany, all these other countries didn't experience inflation like we have. The difference was that Biden's policies that he put in place spurred this kind of inflation.""

Russia has warned that banning its oil could make prices reach $300 a barrel or more, and Lankford said if that happens, it would affect Europe most, as it depends on Russia for 38% of its energy needs.

Europe's countries are already talking about returning to former production systems, with Germany talking about reopening its coal-fired power plants and France speaking about a return to nuclear, said Lankford.

Meanwhile, it will be decades before the use of electric vehicles will be widely seen, Lankford said.

""We only have 2% of electrical vehicles on the road,"" he said. ""They're talking about doubling that number in the next 10 years. Well, great, that's 4%. That's not going to get us there.""

The senator on Thursday said he won't be endorsing any candidates to replace Sen. James Inhofe, after the 87-year-old Oklahoma Republican announced his retirement, but said he is proud of Inhofe for his service and that he's ""retiring with honor.""

""It's like they don't even understand that big government, big government spending, and the policies that they advocate are ruining this country,"" the Texas Republican said on Newsmax's ""America Right Now."" ""What's even better for us is President (Joe) Biden cannot stand it that President (Donald) Trump's numbers were much, much larger and better.""

That's because under Trump, ""we had the highest number of people working,"" Sessions said. ""We had great gas prices at the pump that was half of what they are today. America was happy. The stock market was great; savings were great. But better than that, we had respect and authority in other countries ... now that has entirely changed.""

Meanwhile, the Democrats are ""making friends with inflation,"" Session said.

""For the longest time, (Treasury Secretary) Janet Yellen and all the Democrats have said this inflation is not going to stick, but the Treasury Department and the Fed keeps dumping $110 billion in the economy, which means that big government spending is still underway,"" the congressman said.

Sessions further on Saturday said congressional Republicans are wanting to hold the FBI and federal law enforcement accountable after the arrests of former Trump adviser Peter Navarro and other Republicans as the midterms near and the Jan. 6 Select Committee begins its televised hearings.

""Let's remember in January I presume that we will win back the majority, and it means that we will be able to call as witnesses these people that do need to answer the specific questions,"" Sessions said.

""They know that there are overusing heavy-handed tactics,"" he added. ""This is where the politicization of the Department of Justice has a lot to do with what people look at and see as fairness, and it is not fairness ... lots of people try and make sense of this and they ask me, 'Is it really this way?'

newsmax,Economy,12347,newsmax,"Congress voted overwhelmingly Thursday to suspend normal trade relations with Russia and ban the importation of its oil, ratcheting up the U.S. response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine amid reports of atrocities.

House action came after the Senate approved the two bills with 100-0 votes. The measures now go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.

Lawmakers overwhelmingly support the substance of the two bills, but they had languished for weeks in the Senate as lawmakers worked to hammer out the final details.

Biden has already taken executive action to ban Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal to the United States. The legislation puts the effort into law.

The bill to end normal trade relations with Russia paves the way for Biden to enact higher tariffs on various imports, such as certain steel and aluminum products, further weakening the Russian economy under President Vladimir Putin. It also ensures Belarus receives less favorable tariff treatment.

Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., said innocent Ukrainians were being slaughtered even as lawmakers were meeting.

“We have no time to waste and must immediately further punish Vladimir Putin,” Neal said. “What we have witnessed in Bucha over the course of the last 72 hours alone more than justifies the positions we have taken in the past and to be more assertive and aggressive going into the future.”

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced late Wednesday a breakthrough in negotiations to bring the bills up for votes before lawmakers travel back to their home states and congressional districts for two weeks. Some lawmakers said that the failure to take final action on the bills was sending the wrong message to allies and to Russia.

“Now, I wish this could have happened sooner, but after weeks of talks with the other side, it’s important that we have found a path forward,” Schumer said.

Schumer said the images coming out of Ukraine as the war drags on “are pure, pure evil. Hundreds of civilians murdered in cold blood.”

“No nation whose military is committing war crimes deserves free trade status with the United States,” Schumer said moments before the vote.

While there was overwhelming support for suspending preferential trade treatment for Russia, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blocked speedy consideration of the bill over concerns that its language on who can be sanctioned for human rights abuses is too broad, leaving it ripe for abuse. A few other Republicans had voiced similar concerns.

Schumer opted to let senators work behind the scenes on language that lawmakers from both parties and the White House could accept, rather than chew up floor time to overcome the filibuster.

Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said, practically speaking, the impact of the delay on the trade bill is minimal “because there’s virtually no trade right now coming in from Russia.” Still, he said passage of the bill is important.

“Messaging is important here and showing action is important,” Cardin said. “You’ve got the Ukrainians on the battlefield every day. The least we can do is get these bills passed.”

The bills also provides the president with the authority to return normal tariff treatment for Russia as well as resume trade in Russian energy products subject to certain conditions.

While Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, it carries a high price for lawmakers in Congress who viewed the ban as a moral test in blocking an economic lifeline for Putin’s regime.

The House votes were not unanimous as they were in the Senate, but the no votes were scarce. The bill suspending Russia's preferential trade status passed by a vote of 420-3. The bill banning Russia energy imports passed by a vote of 413-9.

“America is unwavering in our commitment to the Ukrainian people, and the Congress will continue to hold Russia to account,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

The White House says that sanctions the U.S. and more than 30 other nations have already enacted have stung the Russian economy. It said that experts are now predicting Russia’s GDP will contract up to 15% this year and that inflation is already spiking above 15%. More than 600 private sectors companies have already left the market.

“Russia will very likely lose its status as a major economy, and it will continue a long descent into economic, financial, and technological isolation,” the White House report said.",Economy
newsmax,Economy,11229,newsmax,"The United States is already suffering from record inflation, and if Russia invades Ukraine, that could cause ""a big problem"" moving forward, Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wis., warned Saturday on Newsmax.

""I think President [Joe] Biden is doing a horrible job in so many ways, and you'll get the new border numbers and you wonder what the degree is what he cares about the country at all,"" Grothman told ""The Count.""

Even without the Ukraine situation, ""inflation is going to get worse,"" Grothman added, but when the pressure on the nation's energy industry an invasion could bring, the national inflation rate will ""go up even more. No doubt about it.""

The congressman added he is concerned about some of Biden's nominees for the Federal Reserve, who he said will ""continue this green-first policy"" and, if they are approved, would result in energy prices continuing to climb.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, indicated this past week, Republicans could agree to pass four out of Biden's five nominees, but are not comfortable with former Fed board of governor's member Sarah Bloom Raskin, reports The Hill.

Meanwhile, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, has called to delay chamber votes on the nominees unless Republican lawmakers agree on considering all five picks, and press secretary Jen Psaki said the White House ""absolutely"" backs that strategy.

Biden has said he understands Americans' pain over inflation, but Grothman said he does not agree.

""If he understood, he wouldn't keep pushing for trillions of dollars in spending, and he wouldn't be nominating people to the Federal Reserve who don't, I think, get it,"" Grothman said.

He added, the M2 monetary supply is growing faster than it did in the 1970s.

""For people like me who remember the '70s, it's just one of the many ways the future of America has been put at risk by Joe Biden,"" Grothman concluded.

newsmax,Economy,13533,newsmax,"Former President Donald Trump must answer questions under oath in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into his business practices, a state appeals court ruled Thursday, rejecting his argument that he be excused from testifying because his answers could be used in a parallel criminal probe.

A four-judge panel in the appellate division of the state’s trial court upheld Judge Arthur Engoron's Feb. 17 ruling, which enforced subpoenas requiring that Trump and his two eldest children — Ivanka and Donald Jr. — give deposition testimony in Attorney General Letitia James’ probe.

""The existence of a criminal investigation does not preclude civil discovery of related facts, at which a party may exercise the privilege against self-incrimination,"" the appellate panel wrote, citing the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and other legal protections for witnesses.

Lawyers for the Trumps agreed in March that they would sit for depositions within 14 days of an appellate panel decision upholding Engoron’s ruling. They could also appeal the decision to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, delaying the matter and the Trumps’ potential testimony indefinitely.

A message seeking comment was left with lawyers for the Trumps.

James lauded the ruling, which came just two weeks after the appellate panel heard oral arguments in the case. She tweeted that her investigation ""will continue undeterred because no one is above the law.""

""Once again, the courts have ruled that Donald Trump must comply with our lawful investigation into his financial dealings,"" James said in a written statement.

""We will continue to follow the facts of this case and ensure that no one can evade the law.""

James has said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, used “fraudulent or misleading” valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits. Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. have both been executives in the Trump Organization and are among their father’s most trusted allies.

The appellate panel, in its ruling, described the investigation as focusing on whether the Trumps ""committed persistent fraud in their financial practices and disclosures.""

Trump, a Republican, denies the allegations and has said James' investigation in part of a politically motivated ""witch hunt.""

In appealing Engoron’s subpoena ruling, his lawyers argued that James, a Democrat, was engaging in ""selective prosecution."" The appellate panel rejected that, saying the investigation was on solid legal footing and that the Trumps showed no evidence they or their company were ""treated differently"" than other companies under similar scrutiny.

A lawyer for the Trumps, Alan Futerfas, told the appellate panel in oral arguments on May 11 that James appeared to be using civil subpoenas to get around a New York law that requires immunity for people testifying before a criminal grand jury.

Judith Vale, arguing on behalf of James’ office, countered there was ample evidence from the civil investigation to support subpoenas for the Trumps’ testimony.

She also cited legal precedent allowing the attorney general’s office to do so, and said the Trumps could always invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination — as Trump’s son Eric did hundreds of times in a 2020 deposition.

Appellate Court Judge Rolando T. Acosta appeared to agree with that position, foreshadowing Thursday’s ruling as he questioned Futerfas from the bench.

Anything Trump says in a civil deposition in James’ investigation could be used against him in the criminal probe being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

Last summer, spurred by evidence uncovered by James' office, the DA's office charged the Trump Organization and its longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, with tax fraud, alleging he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty.

Thursday's appellate court ruling was the latest in a flurry of legal activity involving Trump and the attorney general’s investigation in the last few weeks.

Last week, Trump paid $110,000 in fines and met several other conditions as he seeks to end a contempt of court order Engoron issued on April 25 after he was slow to respond to another subpoena from James seeking documents and other evidence.

On Monday, James’ office said it had subpoenaed Trump’s longtime executive assistant, Rhona Graff, and planned to question her under oath next week in the probe.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in New York is expected to rule soon in a lawsuit Trump filed against James in December in an attempt to shut down her investigation. Trump’s lawyers want an injunction to halt the probe. James' office is seeking to throw out the lawsuit.

At a May 13 hearing in the federal case, a lawyer for James’ office said it was ""nearing the end"" of the probe and that “there’s clearly been a substantial amount of evidence” to support a civil enforcement proceeding, although a final determination hasn't been made.

Since James' investigation is civil in nature, she could end up bringing a lawsuit and seeking financial penalties against Trump or his company, or even a ban on them being involved in certain types of businesses.

newsmax,Economy,12138,newsmax,"Economist Art Laffer, an adviser to former President Ronald Reagan, told Newsmax on Wednesday that he ""doubts it very much"" that the U.S. will enter a recession by the end of 2022, but ""it could be really fast and oncoming.""

Laffer said on ""The Chris Salcedo Show"" that the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates to ""10, 11, 12%,"" but believes ""there's no chance the Fed will raise interest rates up to the levels they should be raised in order to stop this inflation.""

""My worry is much more, Chris: that we're going to have inflation, it's going to continue and it's going to get worse. That's really my fear,"" Laffer warned.

The economist also commented on the spike in oil and gasoline prices. He rejected the idea that Democrats are consciously seeking foreign energy dependence, attributing the war on fossil fuels instead to the left's green energy agenda.

""I think they're just hating oil. They hate fossil fuels and total coal, oil, any of these things they hate. And what they're trying to do happens to fall into the bailiwick of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and Russian production of oil and energy,"" Laffer said.

""This does fit very much into the Russian agenda, but I don't think there's any conspiracy here between American clean energy ... policies and the Russian attempt to get higher oil prices,"" he added.

Laffer aired his belief that ""people deserve the government's they get"" when discussing the Biden administration's policies amid skyrocketing inflation, saying, ""The one way Americans can protect themselves, and it's one simple way, is vote these guys out in November.""

""Vote the whole lot out. The Democrats in the House and in the Senate have been unanimous in their support of anti-energy production policies here in the U.S.,"" he added.

""So, if they don't do that ... you're going to get a lot worse now. Oil prices get up. Gas prices get up to $8, $9, $10 a gallon. You're going to have real problems across the whole U.S. structure, and it will lead to something very much like a recession.""

newsmax,Economy,14531,newsmax,"More than 5 million barrels of oil that were part of a historic U.S. emergency oil reserves release aimed at lowering domestic fuel prices were exported to Europe and Asia last month, according to data and sources, even as U.S. gasoline and diesel prices touched record highs.

The export of crude and fuel is blunting the impact of the moves by President Joe Biden designed to lower record pump prices. Biden on Saturday renewed a call for gasoline suppliers to cut their prices, drawing criticism from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

About 1 million barrels per day is being released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) through October. The flow is draining the SPR, which last month fell to the lowest since 1986. U.S. crude futures are above $105 per barrel and gasoline and diesel prices above $5 a gallon in one-fifth of the nation. U.S. officials have said oil prices could be higher if the SPR had not been tapped.

The fourth-largest U.S. oil refiner, Phillips 66, shipped about 470,000 barrels of sour crude from the Big Hill SPR storage site in Texas to Trieste, Italy, according to U.S. Customs data. Trieste is home to a pipeline that sends oil to refineries in central Europe.

Atlantic Trading & Marketing (ATMI), an arm of French oil major TotalEnergies, exported 2 cargoes of 560,000 barrels each, the data showed.

Phillips 66 declined to comment on trading activity. ATMI did not respond to a request for comment.

Cargoes of SPR crude were also headed to the Netherlands and to a Reliance refinery in India, an industry source said. A third cargo headed to China, another source said.

At least one cargo of crude from the West Hackberry SPR site in Louisiana was set to be exported in July, a shipping source added.

""Crude and fuel prices would likely be higher if [the SPR releases] hadn't happened, but at the same time, it isn't really having the effect that was assumed,"" said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst at Kpler.

The latest exports follow three vessels that carried SPR crude to Europe in April helping replace Russian crude supplies.

U.S. crude inventories are the lowest since 2004 as refineries run near peak levels. Refineries in the U.S. Gulf coast were at 97.9% utilization, the most in three and a half years.",Economy

""It was not just my home that was raided last month — it was the hopes and dreams of every citizen who I have been fighting for since the moment I came down the golden escalator in 2015, wanting to represent the people, wanting to stop the massive corruption in this country,"" Trump told the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania rally, which aired lived on Newsmax.

""The radical Democrats are engaging in a desperate attempt to keep me from returning to the White House, where they know I will clean this mess up again,"" Trump added. ""They want to stop us from completing our mission to bring back American values.""

Trump noted the raid was conducted ""on a phony pretext"" in order to deflect from Biden's struggles and the impending midterm elections.

""The Biden administration invaded the home of their chief political opponent, who is absolutely destroying him and everyone else in the polls — I hate to say it — even including the Republicans, but we love the Republicans,"" Trump said, noting the raid began only after ""getting permission from a highly political magistrate, who they handpicked late in the evening, just days before the break in and trampled upon my rights and civil liberties.""

Even the room of Trump's son Barron, 16, was subjected to an invasive search, Trump said for the first time.

""They rifled through the first lady's closet drawers and everything else, and even did a deep and ugly search of the room of my 16-year-old son, leaving everything they touched in far different conditions than it was when they started,"" Trump said. ""Can you believe it?

""The FBI and the Justice Department have become vicious monsters, controlled by radical-left scoundrels, lawyers, and the media who tell them what to do.""

Trump claimed it is a weaponization of the Justice Department in order to meddle in the political process and the midterm elections.

""They're trying to silence me, and more importantly, they are trying to silence you, but we will not be silenced, right?"" Trump said. ""We will never stop speaking the truth.

""We have no choice, because we're not going to have a country left. The evil and malice of this demented persecution of you and me should be obvious to all and it is. Even media companies that are pretty far left have come out and said, 'We can't believe this is happening in the USA.'""

The politicization of justice under Biden is a ""disgrace,"" Trump said, ripping the leak of a photo of seized documents on the floor at Mar-a-Lago.

""They talk about documents not being properly stored; yet, they go in and take documents, dumped them on the floor, stage a photo shoot, and pretend that I had done it — like I had put them all over the floor,"" Trump said. ""They took that back after a lot of prodding.

""Then they put out for public consumption a picture, which is seen all over the world. This is what they do. It's called disinformation. These are very dishonest, sick people. Very dishonest people. Americans are sick of the lies, sick of the hoaxes, and scams, and above all, sick of the hypocrisy.""

This is all going to backfire in the midterm elections, Trump predicted.

""But our opponents have badly miscalculated,"" he said. ""This egregious abuse of the law is going to produce a backlash the likes of which nobody has ever seen.

""They think they can divide us, but they can't divide us. The MAGA movement is the greatest in the history of our country, in the history of the world.""

newsmax,Election,10525,newsmax,"Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, tore into Alabama Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban and basketball executive Jerry West during a congressional hearing on Thursday for advocating Democratic voting legislation, Breitbart reported.

Earlier in the week, Saban, West, and three other prominent sports figures wrote a letter to Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., pressuring him to support theff John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and Freedom Vote Act.

The bills seek to broaden what constitutes voter identification, make Election Day a federal holiday, and restrict southern states’ ability to change election laws, according to NPR.

Roy cited the letter they sent to Manchin during the House Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing and questioned whether the five sports figures actually read the bills, per Breitbart.

""No doubt these famed election law experts spent the weekend reading the federal legislation, which they were lobbying,"" the congressman said sarcastically. ""Cause I mean, I got the 700-page bill at 11:30 last Thursday night before voting on it on Friday…I assume they read it thoroughly over the weekend. As my staff stayed up in the middle of the night doing to actually see what was in the bill.""

The Texas congressman also highlighted the regional bias of the Democrat voting legislation, specifically in targeting the post-Civil Rights American South.

""You don’t hear them complaining about Delaware,"" Roy said. :You don’t see the Biden administration bringing Delaware to court. You don’t see the Biden/Garland Department of Justice suing Maryland. … Why are they doing this? Because they have to claim voting rights were being violated to try to save themselves politically.""

""The purpose [of the bills] is to delegitimize elections ahead of the game and to unintentionally divide the country,"" he added. The Democrats have ""spent four years on Russian collusion. Now they’re setting up the narrative for 2022, to use race-baiting to create a toxic environment of distrust to delegitimize a possible GOP majority.""",Election
newsmax,Election,13916,newsmax,"Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., told Newsmax on Friday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., rejected recommendations from Republicans when establishing the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot select committee because she ''wanted one narrative.''

''This select committee I voted against creating because I knew it would turn into a partisan circus if Speaker Pelosi did what she did,'' Davis said on ''Spicer & Co.''

''She didn't seat us, didn't seat two members of the committee, which is unprecedented. And that is something that has never happened in the history of the House,'' he added.

Davis, ranking member of the House Administration Committee, was one of five original selections by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to be placed on the Jan. 6 panel, CNN reported.

At the time, he was set to join Republican Reps. Jim Banks (Ind.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Troy Nehls (Texas) and Kelly Armstrong (N.D.). McCarthy, however, pulled all five of his selections in protest after Pelosi rejected the placement of Banks and Jordan.

The Illinois congressman said he wrote to Jan. 6 panel head Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., to preserve all documents related to the event because Republicans ''absolutely'' plan to launch a counter-invasion if they take back the House in November.

''We've uncovered evidence that the select committee has spent more of taxpayer dollars than even our Veterans' Affairs Committee has this year. These are expenses that need to be looked into,'' Davis wrote.

''We've also uncovered evidence that the select committee has broken house rules,'' he continued. ''These broken House rules include hiring consultants like the ABC consultant. That is against House rules and should result in a House ethics charge if proven correctly.''

Davis, who has represented Illinois' 13th Congressional District since 2013, is seeking a sixth House term in the state's newly drawn 15th District. He faces incumbent Rep. Mary Miller in the June 28 GOP primary.

newsmax,Election,14593,newsmax,"Japan — and most of the world — were shaken by the news Friday morning that an assassin’s bullet had taken the life of Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister and a still-towering figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

TV films show Abe, 68, shot twice in the back while delivering a political speech in Nara, Japan. In a country with some of the strictest gun control laws in the world, the suspect apparently killed Abe with what police described as a ""handmade gun.""

For many Japanese, images were evoked of the last political assassination in their country that is etched in its history — on Oct. 12, 1960, on live television.

Inejiro Asanuma, leader of the Japan Socialist Party, was participating in a debate with two other party leaders at the Hibiya Public Hall. The debate was carried live by the national broadcaster NHK and was watched in studio by a crowd of 2,500.

Asanuma was one of Japan's most charismatic politicians, and easily one of the most controversial. He had visited Communist China, called for an alliance between Beijing and Tokyo, and was a leader in the opposition to the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty known as ANPO (and which was strongly pushed by Prime Minister Nobosuke Kishi, grandfather of Shinzo Abe; Kishi once admonished his 5-year-old grandson for running through his home yelling ""Down with ANPO!"" which Abe had heard from protest marchers outside his grandson's residence).

Asanuma was a hated figure among the nationalist movement in Japan, which called for an end to its post-war constitution and a restoration of emperor worship. One who particularly hated the socialist leader was Otoya Yamaguchi, 17, son of an officer in the Japan Self-Defense Forces and so radicalized that he had been arrested 10 times in protests against ANPO.

As Asanuma spoke in the debate with Liberal Democratic Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda (who succeeded to the office when Kishi’s government fell earlier that year) and Democratic Socialist Leader Suheiro Nishio, Yamaguchi suddenly sprang from the audience. He drew a short samurai sword and twice plunged it in Asanuma.

As startled Japanese viewers remained glued to their television sets, Yamaguchi attempted to take his own life with the sword, but a crowd had quickly swarmed and overpowered him.

He was later charged with murder and imprisoned. On Nov. 2, after writing ""Would I had 7 lives to give for my country"" on his prison cell wall in toothpaste, the teenaged assassin hanged himself with his bedsheets.

Asanuma, 61, died from internal bleeding minutes after he arrived at a nearby hospital. In the coming general election, Prime Minister Ikeda was widely criticized for not providing necessary security for his opponent. But after a stirring eulogy of Asanuma in the Diet (Parliament) that moved many to tears, Ikeda led the LDP Party to a big win.

Even those born long after this tragic scene know exactly what it is and many can describe it in detail. Press photographer Yashushi Nagao’s photographic capturing the stabbing won the Pulitzer Prize.

The assassination inspired a best-selling novel as well as imitators — young nationalists attempting to take the lives of other politicians with which they disagreed. At a time when assassinations were rare in the world and television was in its infancy, the film of the knife attack is something that shook a nation and a world that would see it in movie newsreels a week later.

The killing of Asanuma had a major impact on Japan for generations. It is very likely the killing of Abe will do the same.

newsmax,Election,13377,newsmax,"Dr. Kelli Ward, chair of the Arizona Republican Party, told Newsmax Thursday that Republicans are gaining ground with ""Blacks, Asians, and especially Hispanics"" as woke Democrats push ""detrimental economic policies and ... divisive social issues.""

""People — no matter what color their skin is — they understand that the Democrats are the party of crazy,"" Ward said during an appearance on ""The Chris Salcedo Show.""

The comments from Ward come the same day Quinnipiac released its latest poll showing President Joe Biden's approval among Hispanic Americans plummeting from 55% last year to 26%.

The drop makes Biden less popular with Hispanics than any other demographic, including white Americans, age group and gender.

Biden also saw a drop in support among Black Americans, sitting at just over 63% in approval. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden won the group 87% to 12% over then-President Donald Trump, CNN exit polling data showed.

Ward said she believed a primary reason for the shift was because ""Democrats have gone way too far.""

""I think that's why people across the board are waking up and saying, 'We cannot have this radical, baby-killing machine that the Democrats want to create across our great country,'"" the GOP chair said.

According to FiveThirtyEight, Republicans lead Democrats by 2.3% in an average of midterm party preference polls. That's a stark contrast to the last midterm election in 2018, where Democrats won the generic ballot by 8.4%, per RealClearPolitics.

newsmax,Election,12349,newsmax,"One of the nation's biggest battleground states could be in line for a registration makeover.

According to Reuters, an updated data review reveals that Republicans in Pennsylvania are registering former Democrats at four times the rate of the reverse process (Republicans turning Democratic).

This substantive switch has become a ""warning sign for Democrats,"" as they fight to hold the congressional majority in the Keystone State.

The Reuters report adds more credence to speculation of the Republicans tipping the proverbial scales in the November midterm elections, perhaps reclaiming the national majority in the House and Senate chambers.

The data from the report also suggests the Pennsylvania GOP is on track for the ""highest conversion rate in at least a decade and well above 2016, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives, and Senate.""

According to Breitbart News, Democrats still maintain a registered voter advantage in Pennsylvania — 4 million Democrats to 3.4 million Republicans (as of March 28). It represents, however, the Democrats' smallest lead in the state since 2005.

Along those lines, Florida and Nevada are posting similarly fruitful registration rates among new Republicans, coinciding with the Democrats' decline in the two states.

The Congressional Leadership Fund, the House Republican-aligned group that supports its members and policies, has been quick to trumpet the uptick in registration rolls with the GOP in Pennsylvania. This affiliation surge might leave formerly entrenched Democrats, such as Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., vulnerable come November.

""Voters are looking elsewhere for leadership because Susan Wild's and Democrats' toxic agenda has made life more difficult than ever for Pennsylvania families,"" said CLF press secretary Cally Perkins.

Citing Ballotpedia, the last two presidential elections in Pennsylvania were decided by less than 2 percentage points.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden topped Republican Donald Trump by a margin of 1.2 percentage point. Four years earlier, Trump best Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton by a 0.7 percentage-point margin.

This year's U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania could produce a number of twists and turns, now that incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has opted not to run for reelection.

On the GOP side, a Real Clear Politics poll has David McCormick leading TV star Mehmet Oz in four of five primary tracking polls.

newsmax,Election,12587,newsmax,"Former President Donald Trump endorsed incumbent Rep. Ralph Norman from South Carolina’s 5th Congressional District for reelection on Monday through a statement from the Save America PAC.

“Ralph is a fierce advocate for our America First movement. He is working hard to Secure the Southern Border, Lower your Taxes, Support our Brave Military and Vets, Protect the Second Amendment, and hold the Radical Left accountable for their abject failure,” the former president wrote.

Norman was first elected in a 2017 special election after Mick Mulvaney left to become director of the Office of Management and Budget under Trump and later to be promoted to White House chief of staff.

He faced a narrow Republican primary run-off that year to receive the party’s nomination, defeating state Rep. Tommy Pope by only around 200 votes.

Since then, Norman has been a close ally of Trump and was re-elected in 2018 and 2020. He notably called out former House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney last year after she defended her decision to vote in favor of impeaching the former president.

“But the other thing that bothers me, Liz, is your attitude. You’ve got a defiant attitude,” the congressman said of Cheney months before she was stripped of her leadership position.

Norman’s district was not competitive before the 2020 Census redistricting process and still is not, going from a partisan lean of R+23 to R+26, according to FiveThirtyEight.

The congressman is running unopposed in the 2022 Republican primary for District 5. Depending on who wins the Democratic primary, he will face either biologist Kevin Eckert or Evangeline Hundley in the November election, per Ballotpedia.

''I think Sen. Rounds told the truth about what happened in the 2020 election,'' McConnell said on CNN. ''And I agree with him.''

Appearing Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' Rounds said: ''While there were some irregularities, there were none of the irregularities which would have risen to the point where they would have changed the vote outcome in a single state. We simply did not win the election as Republicans for the presidency.''

But shortly after Rounds' remarks, Trump released a statement announcing his withdrawal of support for Rounds.

Rounds is ''a weak and ineffective leader,'' Trump said in a statement. ''I hereby firmly pledge that he will never receive my Endorsement again!''

And shortly after that, Rounds released a statement in response to the former president, saying that he was ''disappointed but not surprised'' by Trump's comments.

''As a Republican Party,'' Rounds added, ''our focus should be on what lies ahead, not what's in the past. Elections are about growing support for your party, not further dividing it.''

Since Rounds' statement, other Republican senators have either shown support for the South Dakota senator or echoed his sentiments, saying that it's time for the party to move on.

On Monday, Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney said Rounds spoke the ''truth knowing that our Republic depends upon it.''

And fellow South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune said: ''I don't think relitigating or rehashing the past is a winning strategy.

Led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a group of senators wrote a letter in which they said the 2020 election was the ""most secure in American history,"" but said $50 billion is needed over the next decade for election administration and security, reported The Hill.

""We must continue to help both state and local election officials modernize their voting equipment, improve the administration of elections, and strengthen cybersecurity for election systems,"" the letter reads.

The letter was signed by Sens. Richard Durbin, Ill.; Richard Blumenthal, Conn.; Cory Booker, N.J.; and Tim Kaine, Va.; among others, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who caucuses with the Democrats.

The senators said that they were working on legislation to ""provide election officials a reliable stream of funding to make ongoing improvements to election administration.""

""While funding is not a substitute for Congress passing comprehensive legislation to protect the freedom to vote and stop the ongoing attacks on our democracy, we must ensure that state and local election officials continue to receive the resources needed to administer, improve, and modernize our elections,"" the senators wrote.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice: ""Congress must make a long-term commit­ment to fund­ing elec­tion secur­ity. Before 2018, Congress had not appro­pri­ated funds for elec­tions since the Help Amer­ica Vote Act passed in 2002.

newsmax,Election,14906,newsmax,"A judge in New York has ordered Rudy Giuliani to appear next month before a special grand jury in Atlanta that's investigating claims that former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 general election in Georgia.

New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber on July 13 issued an order directing Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor, to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 9 and on any other dates ordered by the court in Atlanta, according to documents filed Wednesday in Fulton County Superior Court.

Giuliani's lawyer did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment Wednesday.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis began her investigation early last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request. In a letter requesting the special grand jury, she said her team was looking into “any coordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state.”

Earlier this month, she filed petitions to compel seven Trump associates, including Giuliani and U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, to testify before the special grand jury.

Because they don't live in Georgia, she had to use a process that involves getting a judge in the state where they live to order them to appear.

Giuliani had been summoned to appear in court in New York on July 13 to present any reasons why a subpoena should not be issued for him to testify in Atlanta, but he failed to show up for the hearing, Farber wrote in his order.

In the court filing Wednesday, Willis informed the judge overseeing the special grand jury that Giuliani had been served with Farber's final order instructing him to appear before the special grand jury.

It’s possible that Giuliani could file a motion with the court in Atlanta to try to avoid testifying.

Graham, who has denied any wrongdoing, reached an agreement with Willis yesterday that said he would file any challenge to the attempt to compel his testimony in Georgia, either in Fulton County Superior Court or in federal court in Atlanta, rather than in South Carolina or Washington, where Willis was planning to try to get a judge to issue a subpoena.

U.S. Rep. Jody Hice filed a challenge to a subpoena issued for his testimony in federal court in Atlanta. He has argued that his actions after the election were done in his role as a member of Congress and are shielded from legal proceedings and inquiry. A judge is set to hear arguments on that next week.

Georgia's lieutenant governor and a former state lawmaker also challenged subpoenas. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who's overseeing the special grand jury, declined to quash the subpoenas but did set guidelines for the questions they could be asked based on their status as members of the General Assembly.",Election

""Join the MAGA crew, get a RINO hunting permit,"" the Senate hopeful says, as he and a group of armed men force their way into an empty house. ""There's no bagging limit, no tagging limit, and it doesn't expire until we save our country.""

In the latest ad, Greitens says he isn't a ""career politician"" and will ""take aim at politics as usual,"" as he steps out of a truck.

""Because I fought for you, they came after me,"" Greitens then says in the ad, referring to allegations of sexual harassment and campaign finance violations that led to him resigning in disgrace as Missouri’s governor in 2017.

""But we're back — wiser, stronger, still fighting. But this time, we are coming with an army,"" he continues. ""We will not stop until we take our country back and Make America Great Again.""

Greitens is seeking a political comeback in his bid to replace retiring Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.

Ken Harbaugh, who claims to have known Greitens for 30 years, shared a video on Twitter speaking out about his recent political conduct and calling on the Senate candidate to drop out.

""I have known @EricGreitens for 30 years,"" Harbaugh captioned his video. ""He is a broken man who will do anything, including inciting violence, to regain power. He's not the same person whose weddings I went to. Eric, drop out. Try to repair the damage you have done, to your family, your country and yourself.""

In the video, the Navy veteran recalls taking out a loan to make a $5,000 donation to Greitens' first gubernatorial campaign and said that his mother also donated.

""Things have not gone as I expected,"" he said. ""Eric, I want you to know that there are worse things in life than running for office honorably and losing. Trust me, I've done that.""

Harbaugh ran unsuccessfully for a House seat in Ohio's 7th Congressional District in 2018, according to Ballotpedia.

""What you're doing now is not honorable and it is not a reflection of the Eric I knew,"" he said.

""Your call to hunt down Republicans who disagree with you?"" Harbaugh continued. ""That's my mom, Eric. Just because she doesn't think the election was stolen — and, let's be honest, you don't either — that's not a reason to threaten her.

newsmax,Election,14175,newsmax,"Voters selected the Republican nominee for Alabama's top election official Tuesday, and four other statewide races plus a U.S. House nomination were on the ballot. Here is a look at the races:

State Rep. Wes Allen won the Republican nomination for secretary of state on Tuesday in runoff that featured both candidates promoting the need to tighten election security in harmony with former President Donald Trump’s claims that he lost the 2020 presidential race because of fraud.

Allen defeated outgoing State Auditor Jim Zeigler and will face Democrat Pamela J. Laffitte, an Air Force veteran and corrections supervisor in Mobile County, in the general election to become Alabama’s top election official.

Zeigler received the most votes among four candidates in the primary election in May, but Allen overcame the deficit.

Allen, from Troy, previously served as probate judge in Pike County. Citing the potential for fraud, he opposed early voting and no-excuse absentee balloting and sponsored a law that barred “curbside” voting meant in part to make it easier for people with disabilities to cast a ballot.

During the campaign, Zeigler dubbed himself a “watchman” against ballot fraud, so-called “ballot harvesting” and voting by mail. Trump has blamed all those things and more for his loss to Democratic President Joe Biden.

The current secretary of state, Republican John Merrill, couldn’t run again because of term limits, and the GOP nominee will be a heavy favorite to win in November.

Either Yolanda Rochelle Flowers or state Sen. Malika Sanders Fortier will become the first Black person to win a major party's gubernatorial nomination in Alabama in the Democratic runoff for governor.

Flowers, a career educator from Birmingham, narrowly led a six-person field in the May primary. She ran on a platform of “reconstructing” Alabama by rebuilding its economy and systems for education, health care and criminal justice, Among other things, she advocated for a state lottery and a state minimum wage of $15.

Fortier, a state lawmaker from Selma, campaigned on the theme of building the biblical “beloved community” promoted by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. by improving the state’s economy, schools and health care. She is the daughter of former state Sen. Hank Sanders and attorney Faya Rose Toure.

The eventual winner face Gov. Kay Ivey, who vanquished eight challengers to win the GOP primary without a runoff. Nearly four times as many people voted in the Republican primary as the Democratic primary in May, and Republicans hold every statewide office.

Stan Cooke and Andrew Sorrell are vying for the Republican nomination to succeed state auditor Zeigler.

Cooke, a pastor from the Jefferson County town of Kimberly, claims Alabama is at a crossroads where it could remain a conservative state or come under the control of liberal Democrats. Echoing former President Donald Trump’s claims of election theft, he is highlighting the auditor’s role in appointing county election officials who can prevent Democrats from stealing elections.

Sorrell, a state representative from Colbert County who led balloting in the May primary, also tried to make election security a prime issue, saying a strong auditor is needed to appoint county registrars who will keep voter rolls clean.

The eventual nominee will not have a Democratic opponent in the fall.

Madison County Commission chair Dale Strong won the only runoff among the state’s seven U.S. House seats, claiming the Republican nomination for an open position in north Alabama’s 5th District.

Strong defeated Casey Wardynski, a former Huntsville school superintendent. Strong handily led a six-candidate field with about 45% of the primary vote in May but couldn’t avoid a runoff.

Strong will face Democrat Kathy Warner-Stanton of Decatur in the mostly Republican Tennessee Valley district in November.

The seat was given up by U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, who was in a runoff with former business lobby leader Katie Britt for the seat being vacated by U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby.

Two Republican incumbents on the Alabama Public Service Commission face runoff challenges to keep their jobs on the utility-regulating board.

Jeremy Oden, a former state legislator from Cullman seeking his third term on the three-member commission, cast himself as a conservative bulwark against liberal environmental policies. He received the most votes in May in a four-way race for the Place 1 seat that saw attorney Brent Woodall, a PSC staffer and Republican activist, come in second.

First elected to the PSC in 2014, former Greene County Commissioner Chip Beeker also portrayed himself as an opponent of Democratic environmental policies in his campaign to retain the Place 2 seat. Beeker, who led the primary vote, is opposed by Robert L. McCollum, a small business owner from Tallapoosa County who contends the commission is too close to Alabama Power Co.

No Democrat qualified for either position, making a victory in the Republican runoff tantamount to election.",Election
newsmax,Immigration,12888,newsmax,"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday said his message to migrants heading to the U.S. -- including a projected 18,000 when Title 42 authority is lifted -- is: “Do not come.”

In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mayorkas declared, “Our border is not open.”

“What happens now is individuals are either expelled under the Title 42 authority or they are placed in immigration enforcement proceedings,” he said. “And they are removed if they do not have a valid claim under our law to remain. And so the border is not open. And importantly, they should not place their lives at risk in the hands of smugglers who exploit their lives for the mere purpose of profit.”

According to Mayorkas, an influx at the highest projection of 18,000 would “strain our system.”

“That's precisely why our plan calls for a regional approach to what is a regional challenge,” he said. “We need countries to the south to manage their borders. This is not a phenomenon that the United States experiences alone. There are 1.8 million Venezuelans in Colombia. The Nicaraguans comprise almost 2% of the population in the small country of Costa Rica. We're seeing migration because of challenges that are not restricted to this area. They are global.”

In an interview on Fox News Sunday, Mayorkas also doubled down on that message, and asserted his department has “a handle” on migration to the southern border.

“We have got a handle on it and when I say ‘we,’.. it's not the Department of Homeland Security alone, it's the Federal Bureau of Investigation, it's our entire enforcement in intelligence enterprise.”

“You know what happens to these individuals,” he added. “They are either expelled under the Title 42… or they are placed into immigration enforcement proceedings. They make their claims under the law. If those claims don't prevail, they are promptly removed from the United States.”",Immigration

""Texans need to stand up again and protect our communities,"" Roy wrote Sunday for the Daily Caller. ""Academics can argue in circles about the term 'invasion' and debate possible liabilities incurred by the brave people who stand up to protect our borders; however, no amount of internal legal debate can protect ranchers in south Texas from ending up collateral damage to an administration that scoffs at the rule of law.

""We, Texans, must protect our families, our communities, and our state. The U.S. and Texas Constitution provides us with a path to put an end to this invasion to do just that.""

Roy represents Texas' 21st District and has been a hard-liner for a number of conservative priorities, with the border being one very important to him.

""There is an invasion at our border, and it's past time to officially declare it,"" his opinion piece began.

""We face an invasion organized by heavily armed and dangerous cartels making hundreds of millions of dollars moving human beings and narcotics for profit while purposefully terrorizing Texans, Americans and the migrants seeking to come here.""

Roy noted the record-high border apprehensions are a long way from a number of times past administrations have declared the border migration a ""crisis"":
• ""Jeh Johnson who was DHS Secretary under Obama said that 1,000 apprehensions per day was a 'crisis.'
• In 2019, he wrote, ""the liberal media called our southern border 'a crisis' and said our border was at a 'breaking point.'""

""I have to go through Dallas most time when I come to D.C., and it's very, very common that you see individuals that crossed our border illegally who are walking through the airport with a manila envelope literally tied around their neck with a boarding pass to someplace around the country.""

The immigrants, he added, are ""walking freely through our airports at the same time we all have to wear masks. It doesn't make any sense to me at all.""

But President Joe Biden and Democrats are pushing to have open borders, complete with ending the Title 42 restrictions enacted at the beginning of the pandemic.

""They're still trying to tell us there's a health crisis going on, but, by the way, it only applies to Americans,"" Mullin said. ""It doesn't apply to anybody illegally crossing the border.""

Meanwhile, the administration is giving immigrants free cellphones, all in the name of tracking them, but Mullin said if the administration would return to former President Donald Trump's policies, the problems would not be happening.

""We've continued dumping money into a population that Democrats think is going to vote for them, and that's their whole goal here,"" Mullin added. ""That's why they want to have open borders. That's why they're not enforcing our border laws to begin with, but at the same time they're allowing illegal drugs to flood across there, allowing sex trafficking go across.""

Mullin also noted the Drug Enforcement Agency is warning there will be a higher influx of fentanyl coming into the country once Title 42 is lifted.

""They've already apprehended over 11,000 pounds, which is enough to kill every American in the country, but they're completely turning a blind eye to it,"" Mullin said. ""It's inexcusable.""

Mullin also spoke out about Wednesday's meeting of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , where Democrats accused big oil companies of ""ripping off the American people"" while putting profits ahead of production as gas prices rise.

""Profits are bad, even though these are the individuals that's creating the jobs that are paying the taxes, that are paying for their salaries,"" Mullin said. ""But yet it doesn't make any sense. Their knowledge or lack of knowledge on this is just honestly asinine.""

But the Democrats are trying to push the claims Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine are to blame for the higher pump prices because ""they've got nothing else.""

""They're trying to push us all into socialism,"" he said. ""Socialism is to take over the government, and blame capitalism for the reason they're doing it … they're not going to talk about their failed policies.""

newsmax,Immigration,13465,newsmax,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton hasn't had much free time to celebrate last week's District Court victory involving Title 42, which effectively prevented the Biden administration from repealing the ''42'' health order as of May 23.

Why is that?

Paxton has been busy running a reelection campaign for the Texas AG post, squaring off against fellow Republican George P. Bush — the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush, nephew of former President George W. Bush and son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

But make no mistake: Once the smoke clears on Tuesday's GOP primary runoff, where Paxton already predicted a ""pretty significant whooping"" for his campaign Monday on Newsmax, he might finally revel in the Title 42 afterglow.

On ""Spicer and Co.,"" Paxton praised former President Donald Trump for his comprehensive approach to dealing with immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, through the onset of Title 42.

""[Then-President] Trump clearly made a difference with immigration. ... All those things worked. It's not hard to figure out. Just follow the map,"" Paxton said to Newsmax co-hosts Sean Spicer and Lyndsay Keith, while emphasizing how the number of unlawful crossings at the southern border dropped substantially from the Obama to Trump administrations.

From Paxton's perspective, Trump's four-point plan with immigration succeeded at all levels:

1. Obliging the migrants seeking amnesty in America to remain in Mexico.

 2. Unlocking the full logistical potential of the Title 42 health order.

 3. Catching migrants crossing the border illegally, and releasing them into Mexico.

 4. Finishing the border wall.

But now, Paxton said, President Joe Biden has needlessly brought back chaos to the southern border, allowing migrants to break records with unlawful crossings nearly every month, while perhaps being lax or lenient as dangerous drugs pour into the country.

Biden ""basically put together a partnership with the cartels,"" Paxton said.

Friday's ruling was merely a ''stay'' decision for the plaintiffs, covering 24 states.

While Title 42 has been an effective resource for immigration officers to implement when expelling migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, including asylum-seekers, Paxton also acknowledges that the Louisiana court's decision — while vitally important — might not have long-term staying power.

""But temporary is good for us now,"" Paxton said, while alluding to the 11 other lawsuits connected to stopping the Biden administration with immigration-related matters — some of which could establish high court precedent someday.

newsmax,Immigration,12761,newsmax,"West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice has assumed a prominent role in helping the United States better patrol its southern border.

On Friday, Justice and 25 other Republican governors pledged their support to the new ""American Governors' Border Strike Force,"" with the consortium squarely focused on tackling illegal immigration, drug cartels, and crime at the U.S.-Mexico border.

And on Monday, the West Virginia leader stood up for the U.S. border agents, in the wake of the terrible news surrounding a member of the Texas National Guard (Spc. Bishop E. Evans, 22) drowning over the weekend, after rescuing two migrants in the Rio Grande River, along the treacherous crossover point of Eagle Point, Texas.

On Newsmax, Justice told host Eric Bolling of ""Eric Bolling The Balance"" that the Biden administration has failed to support our country's border agents.

The officers don't make much money, rarely have the public backing of politicians, are obligated to wear body armor daily, and also must worry about getting shot at any time.

And for the final indignity, the border agents could be branded as ""racists,"" when the left-leaning media spins by-the-book conduct or apprehensions in a negative light.

""Now, why in the world would anyone want that job?"" Justice asked rhetorically. ""It's a crying shame. These are true heroes that we absolutely have kicked to the curb, and it's just terrible how we've reacted to these great people doing an incredible job for us.""

Six states separate West Virginia from the U.S.-Mexico border, but that still hasn't stopped the mass influx of drugs — specifically fentanyl — from pouring into Justice's state.

""West Virginia's a long way from the southern border, but we're feeling the effects just like everyone (else in other areas),"" says Justice, while characterizing the state's battle with fentanyl as ""absolutely outrageous"" right now.

According to the governor, drug seizures between 2018 and 2021 are up ""1,700-plus percent"" in West Virginia.

""Where is it coming from? It's coming from China. To the cartels. Across our southern border, and then making it all the way to West Virginia,"" says Justice.

Justice believes the group could make a big difference in reducing the chaos along the southern border.

The Biden administration reportedly allowed 1.66 million unlawful crossings during a 12-month cycle, covering parts of 2020 and 2021; preliminary estimates for 2022 have even more unlawful crossings documented.

The governor loathes the ""super-left craziness"" that comes out of the White House.

And if things don't get rectified soon, Justice says we'll be ""hurting this country beyond belief.""

newsmax,Immigration,10492,newsmax,"The FBI has raided the home of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, amid a federal investigation into the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and its ties to U.S. businessmen, according to ABC News.

Cuellar, a Democrat, has been heavily critical of the Biden administration's handling of conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border in west Texas, where his district lies.

Any raid on Cuellar's home was ""court-authorized,"" an FBI spokesman told ABC News.

A source told ABC News it is not known if Cuellar is a target of the investigation.

Cuellar said in a statement he ""will fully cooperate in any investigation"" and that he is ""committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.""

Cuellar has been a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and has met with Azerbaijan officials, including Azerbaijan Ambassador Elin Suleymanov, according to the report.

The Texas news site myRGV.com reported that more than a dozen agents visited Cuellar's home in Laredo, near the Mexican border, and were seen taking ""cases and other items"" from his home.

Reporter Valerie Gonzalez posted a photo on Twitter of two men in FBI T-shirts approaching a salmon-colored house. Gonzalez said agents had also visited Cuellar's campaign office on Wednesday afternoon.

Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, represents a Texas district that hugs the banks of the Rio Grande, just opposite Mexico. He is facing a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer.

newsmax,Immigration,12811,newsmax,"A federal judge ordered a two-week halt Wednesday on the phasing out of pandemic-related restrictions on seeking asylum — and raised doubts about the Biden administration's plan to fully lift those restrictions on May 23.

For now, the decision is only a temporary setback for the administration. But the judge staked out a position that is highly sympathetic with Louisiana, Arizona and 19 other states that sued to preserve so-called Title 42 authority, which denies migrants a chance at asylum on the grounds of preventing the spread of COVID-19.

“(The states) have established a substantial threat of immediate and irreparable injury resulting from the early implementation of Title 42, including unrecoverable costs on healthcare, law enforcement, detention, education, and other services for migrants,"" wrote U.S. District Judge Robert Summerhays in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Summerhays, who was appointed by former President Donald Trump, said states were likely to succeed with their argument that the administration failed to adhere to federal procedures when it announced April 1 that it was ending Title 42 authority.

The judge has scheduled a critical hearing on May 13 in Lafayette to hear arguments on whether to block Title 42 from ending as planned 10 days later.

The decision to end Title 42 authority was made by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has come under growing criticism from elected officials both Republicans and Biden's fellow Dems -- who contend the administration is unprepared for an anticipated increase in asylum-seekers.

The Justice Department declined to comment on the order but the administration has said it will comply, while contending it will hamper preparations for Title 42 to end on May 23.

About 14% of single adults from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were processed under immigration laws during a seven-day period ending last Thursday. That's up from only 5% in March, according to government figures.

Summerhays' order requires the Homeland Security Department to “return to policies and practices in place” before it announced plans to end Title 42 and to submit weekly reports that demonstrate it is acting “in good faith.”

Migrants have been expelled more than 1.8 million times under the rule invoked in March 2020 by the Trump administration. Migrants were stopped more than 221,000 times at the Mexico border in March, a 22-year-high that has raised concerns about the government's ability to handle even larger numbers when Title 42 is lifted.

Advocates for asylum-seekers say the restrictions endanger people fleeing persecution back home and violates rights to seek protection under U.S. law and international treaty. As the CDC acknowledged, the public health justification for the order has weakened as the threat of COVID-19 has waned.

At two often-contentious hearings Wednesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sought to defend the administration’s handling of an increase of migrants at the Southwest border and its plans to deal with the prospect of more with the potential end of Title 42.

Mayorkas sought to push back on Republican accusations that the Biden administration has encouraged irregular migration by allowing some people to seek asylum, blaming economic and political turmoil and violence throughout Latin America and the world.

“Some of the causes of irregular migration have only been heightened by years of distress preceding this administration,” he said.

Mayorkas testified one day after Homeland Security released a plan with more details about how it was preparing for the end of Title 42 authority.",Immigration
newsmax,Immigration,14870,newsmax,"European countries have spent a great deal of time discussing sanctions and restrictive measures against Russia, Peter Szijjarto, Hungary's minister of foreign affairs and trade tells Newsmax, but he stressed that there's only a one-word answer about what is needed: Peace.

""We have to make everything in order to reach peace as soon as possible in our neighborhood,"" Szijjarto said in an interview with Newsmax's ""National Report"" Tuesday. ""We are a neighboring country and whenever there's a war in your neighboring country, you are under a security risk, so we really want peace, so I think that the whole international community should concentrate on that, how to establish an immediate cease-fire in Ukraine and how to launch substantial and efficient peace talks.""

He added that when determining whether to impose sanctions, some factors must be considered.

First, they must be more painful to Russia than they are to Europe. ""What we experience is that these sanctions are extremely painful to Europe, because of the prices of commodities and then your resources are skyrocketing,"" Szijjarto said.

Then, sanctions can also cause uncertainty. ""They cause extremely high inflation. They cause a lot of uncertainty and suffering for the European economies and basically, it is the people who pay the price.""

Szijjarto is in New York CityTuesday to speak to the United Nations Security Council on the topic of children and armed conflict, and he explained to Newsmax that Hungary is taking several steps to help the thousands of Ukrainian children who have become refugees while fleeing their country.

""The war in Ukraine has been going on for 146 days now, and we, Hungary, are a neighboring country to Ukraine, so we have been experiencing the negative impact of the war from the very beginning,"" Szijjarto said. ""We have already received 840,000 refugees arriving from Ukraine and because of the conscription rules being in power in Ukraine, these are mostly torn apart families, meaning mothers are accompanied by their children and no fathers because they had to stay in Ukraine.

""I have to tell you, it's heartbreaking to see 840,000 refugees like this, and that's why the meeting today chaired by Brazil is so important because it is about how to help the children who are suffering from the armed conflict.""

It is the children who are the most ""significant losers"" from the war, as ""they lose their happy time of being a child, and they lose part of their future as well,"" he continued.

Hungary is taking several steps to help the refugee children:
• Hungary will ensure all Ukrainian children will have free access to education and healthcare.
• Hungary will offer scholarships to Ukrainian students who cannot continue their university studies because the schools are closed.
• The country will help students who were in high school start their university studies in Hungary through state-funded scholarships.

""We know that this does not make their suffering disappear, but definitely, it might help a bit by offering a sense of normalcy,"" said Szijjarto.

Meanwhile, Hungary's government last week declared an energy emergency in response to supply disruptions and skyrocketing energy prices, and Szijjarto told Newsmax that the situation is ""extremely serious"" for Europe.

""Many countries are dependent on deliveries from Russia when it comes to gas and oil, and this is a determination,"" he said. ""This is not because we wanted to have this situation. This is not for fun. This is not based on our own willingness. This is a determination of history and of geography as well.""

Hungary is dependent on Russian energy sources as well, and so far, the supply is uninterrupted, with 89% of what has been contracted arriving, ""which is pretty good, I figure, compared to the western part of Europe,"" Szijjarto said. ""We have to be aware that the western delivery routes and the northern delivery routes in Europe from Russia to the western part of Europe are very uncertain.""

The most certain delivery route at this point is the TurkStream, which delivers gas from Russia to Turkey, and from Bulgaria and Serbia towards central Europe and Hungary, he continued.

""We also do want to buy more gas until the first of October, when the heating season will officially start, to be on the safe side,"" he said. ""It's not easy to buy new quantities on top of the already contracted volumes because of the market situation, which is not a real market situation.

""This is a war market situation currently because there's not enough supplied, so the prices are skyrocketing. But the real question is not the price. The real question is whether you have the quantity.""

newsmax,Immigration,15785,newsmax,"Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott chastised New York City Mayor Eric Adams for ""a publicity campaign fueled by outright lies and misinformation"" concerning migrants being bused from the southern border to the Big Apple.

""Since Texas began busing migrants to New York City from our southern border on Aug. 5, the mayor has been on a publicity campaign fueled by outright lies and misinformation intended to distract from his hesitancy to provide the services and support he self-righteously touted on the campaign trail,"" Abbott wrote.

""Adams' fabricated claims about Texas' treatment of migrants have no basis in reality. To be clear, any migrant who boards a bus from Texas to New York has signed an agreement to be transported to the city. All are provided food and water throughout the journey.""

The Republican governor told the Democrat mayor to follow Adams' own words.

""Mayor Adams likes to sloganeer that 'This is America' and we need to start acting like it. Damn right!"" Abbott wrote. ""We are a nation of laws. It's time to start enforcing them. Doing that would begin to restore the 'humanity' he is clamoring for.""

Abbott in April began busing migrants to blue cities, first and foremost Washington, D.C., in protest of President Joe Biden and the federal government failing to police the migrant surge at the U.S.-Texas border.

New York City earlier this month joined the list of sanctuary cities to which the state of Texas is busing migrants. The first bus pulled into the borough of Manhattan on Aug. 5.

On Aug. 8, Adams said that ""misinformation"" from Lone Star State officials accounted for fewer migrants than expected getting off a bus that he met the previous morning at Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal.

He also claimed migrants were given no food, and were prevented from leaving the bus before it reached New York.

Abbott then publicly dared Adams to ""make my day"" by following through with his threat to send New Yorkers to campaign against his reelection.

""Mayor Adams likes to pat himself on the back for welcoming migrants with open arms to his sanctuary city. That is, until he actually has to follow through on those lofty promises,"" Abbott wrote.

""Adams talked the talk about being a sanctuary city — welcoming illegal immigrants into the Big Apple with warm hospitality. Talk is cheap. When pressed into fulfilling such ill-considered policies, he wants to condemn anyone who is pressing him to walk the walk.""

The governor took aim at Adams' ""hypocrisy.""

""[Adams] now complains that he and New York City are overwhelmed by migrants to such an extent that he demands federal help and discourages Texas from sending more buses to his city,"" Abbott wrote. ""Yet he remained silent when President Biden flew migrants into New York, many of whom ended up in New York City.

""Adams — just like many Americans — is either unaware or refuses to acknowledge that the open-border polices he supports and Biden imposed funnel billions of dollars to the drug cartels that profit off of everyone crossing the border illegally. Inhumanity is the United States policy that aids and abets the cartels — and their US-based smugglers and human traffickers.""",Immigration
newsmax,Immigration,11955,newsmax,"The Biden administration plans to launch an effort this week to make it easier for some Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of their country to come to the United States after only a handful of refugees were admitted in the first two weeks of March, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The initiative would speed up visa processing for relatives of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and detail more staff to handle applications for a temporary status known as ""humanitarian parole,"" one of the people said. The measures would be included under a series of efforts to help Ukrainians trying to get to the United States through existing legal immigration pathways.

The administration is particularly focused on LGBTQ individuals, activists, journalists and other potentially vulnerable groups, said the sources, all of whom requested anonymity to discuss internal plans.

It is unclear how many people could be helped under the new U.S. measures. Lawmakers and advocacy groups have urged the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden to do more to help Ukrainians who want to seek refuge in the United States.

More than 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded that country Feb. 24, according to the United Nations refugee agency, the fastest-moving refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War Two.

But only seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States from March 1-16, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows, as the war intensified and the number of Ukrainians fleeing skyrocketed.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a briefing Tuesday that the administration is taking ""a very close look"" at how to ease Ukrainian family reunifications, but did not provide more details. Last week, another State Department spokesperson said refugee processing in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv had been ""severely impacted"" by the conflict.

The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Biden officials have said the majority of the people fleeing Ukraine will want to remain in Europe, where they can travel without a visa and may have family and friends.

According to State Department data, the United States admitted 514 Ukrainian refugees in January and February during Russia's build-up to the war, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" instead of an invasion.

The Biden administration has said refugees should not try to apply for U.S. tourist visas, which are intended for short stays.

Some Ukrainians have instead traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to ask for asylum at border checkpoints. Several interviewed by Reuters last week were allowed to enter and given one-year humanitarian parole status.

Ukrainians abroad can also apply for humanitarian parole, which allows people to enter the United States on an emergency basis even if they lack a legal visa. But the program faces a steep backlog of tens of thousands of applications already from Afghans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan and others seeking refuge.",Immigration
newsmax,Immigration,14348,newsmax,"President Joe Biden and Democrats' border policy is so twisted and lacking compassion, it is as impossible to understand as it is to argue with, Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said on Newsmax.

""If we want to put an end to this pandemic of human trafficking and in drugs crossing our southern border, then we have to secure a border,"" Mullin told Tuesday's ""National Report.""

""You can't argue with that, but you can't argue with crazy, too, and that's where the left just went. They went completely crazy when it comes to this, and they've just completely ignored it.""

Mullin, who is running in Tuesday night's Senate GOP primary for the seat of retiring Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said Democrats are to blame for circumstances like the tractor trailer in San Antonio, Texas, where at least 50 smuggled migrants were left to die of heat stroke.

""They're supposed to be for the minority — for the people that are our less fortunate. They have turned, totally turned, a blind eye there, too,"" Mullin said. ""That's why the Hispanic vote has left them in waves, because they know that the Democrats are nothing but a bunch of hot air.

""All they want to do is just say words and deliver on nothing because they have no policy to actually move forward.""

Democrats are also hypocritical on the issue of states retaking the authority over making abortion law, Mullin added.

""You have the Democrats that say they're the they supposedly the party of compassion — they're the party of care — and yet they're losing their ever-loving mind because they can't kill babies,"" Mullin said. ""Yet, they call it reproduction rights. I don't understand that, because that means life.""

American voters are going to fully reject the failures of this administration and Democrats, Mullin said.

""The American people are fed up with this,"" he said. ""They see what's actually happening. Instead of the left, instead of Biden and his administration turning back to where the American people believe we should be headed as a country, they're doubling down on this stuff.

""They're not coming back to where the country wants to be, and so the country is going to the Republican party, and I'm excited about today, and I'm excited about what's going to happen today, especially in our election.""

Mullin expects to win Tuesday night's primary election, but acknowledged getting to more than 50% support in a packed 13-candidate field could be difficult. Oklahoma is a reliably red state, so the winner of the Senate GOP primary stands a good chance of taking the Senate seat in November's general election.

""We need to really be focusing on making sure that we're pushing back on the regime and focusing on looking at what we can do to keep this country safe,"" the Oklahoma Republican said on Newsmax's ""National Report.""

Biden is expected to meet with leaders from Israel and Saudi Arabia during his upcoming trip to the Middle East, and Iran and its continued nuclear program are expected to be primary topics of discussion between them.

Bice also on Tuesday discussed the ongoing southern border situation and said it's ""unacceptable"" that the administration is not interested in addressing the root cause of the flow of immigrants.

""We don't have just a border crisis, but we have a national security crisis, and we have a healthcare crisis because this administration is ineffective and unwilling to address the real issues here on the southern border,"" she said. ""The amount of fentanyl that has crossed into the United States since President Biden took office is enough to kill every American nine times over, and this is just unacceptable.""

The situation is becoming dire, she added, as the No. 1 cause of death for people 18-35 is fentanyl overdoses, according to ""Families Against Fentanyl,"" which analyzed data from U.S. government sources.

""The fentanyl that we're seeing cross into the United States is being manufactured in China, and the Border Patrol agents need help,"" she said. ""They are woefully understaffed. They have been worked to the bone, and they're ineffective in being able to execute the mission that they've been tasked to do, which is to secure our southern border.""

Bice said she's visited the border twice and has spoken with officers, who are short-handed and need the extra National Guard troops Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered.

But the Biden administration, she added, is ""allowing this and actually encouraging it. They want to remove Title 42 to be able to allow for more immigrants to cross, and Texas is having to spend billions of dollars, literally $2 billion, to try to secure their own border.""

newsmax,Police,13946,newsmax,"Amid massive crime waves, New York state police and bail reform, and Democrat talk of defunding the police creating ""anti-cop hostility"" – all striking at law enforcement morale – a record number of NYPD officers will quit or retire this year.

More than 1,500 have already resigned or retired thus far, which is on pace to shatter the biggest exodus on record, according to the New York Post.

NYPD pension stats show 524 resignations and 1,072 retirements as of May 31.

""The city is out of control — especially since bail reform,"" a former Queens cop told the Post. ""Get out while you still can.""

The cop, who only wanted to be identified as ""Joe,"" told the Post his job ""got worse and worse"" amid Democrats' reimagining of policing and bail reform, which kept more criminals on the streets and led to New Yorkers not respecting law enforcement.

""The last few years so many people had been leaving and manpower was so low that you'd go to work and you'd answer 25 to 30 jobs a day and you're burnt out by the end of the day,"" he continued to the Post. ""There was no time for law enforcement""

And all the hustling, even if an arrest was made, the criminal was ""back in the precinct picking up their property the same day.""

The exodus is a 38% increase of departures over the same months in 2021 (1,159 departures). And the three-year trend is disturbing, as 2021 was a 46% hike of departures as 1,092 left the force.

""Last year the number of cops who quit before becoming eligible for their full pension was the highest in two decades,"" a source told the Post. ""This year we are on pace for the highest ever recorded.""

While there were 36,900 NYPD officers in 2019, there are now just 34,687, according to the report.

""The NYPD is sliding deeper into a staffing crisis that will ultimately hurt public safety,"" Police Benevolent Association Patrolman Union President Patrick Lynch told the Post. ""Low pay, inferior benefits and constant abuse from the City Council and other anti-cop demagogues has pushed attrition to record highs.

""We need more cops working more hours to turn the tide of violence, but there is only so much overtime they can squeeze out of the cops who remain.""

The NYPD ""is struggling"" to recruit, Lynch added. It was hoping to hire 1,009 new cops in December's recruiting class, but just 675 came through, according to the Post.

""Residents would ask, 'Why does this keep happening?' and I would have to explain to them, 'This guy is going to be locked up tonight, but tomorrow night he's going to come down your block again, he's going to be on the same corner, you're going to see him in the same stores [committing crimes],"" Joe told the Post. ""I wish there was more we could do. But we can’t.""

The NYPD officers jumping ship are not leaving the profession – as much as just leaving New York City, which has suffered through years of Democrat rule and anti-policing policies of former Mayor Bill de Blasio.

New Mayor Eric Adams is a former NYPD captain, but little has changed in the way of anti-policing policy.

""Cops who made the move before me said, 'It's a decision you have to make; you can't turn this job down; the quality of life is better, they treat you more like a human being than a number,'"" Joe said.

The advice includes ""take other [civil service] tests, explore all options, look out of state, Florida, Texas, Arizona,"" Joe continued. ""My friends were all going to the Port Authority, Nassau, Suffolk, MTA [police departments].""

Back at the NYPD in Joe's former Queens precinct, morale has ""plummeted"" even more, he added.

""When I ask, 'How are things?' the response is: 'Horrible – worse than when you left and it's only been six months.'""

The NYPD and crime crises are generational and cannot be fixed quickly, according to John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Joseph Giacalone.

""It will take 20 years to fix this mess,"" he told the Post. ""The city is bleeding blue and only the cop haters will be celebrating.

""There's no way to stop it. Activists, abolitionists, and their pandering politicians have done so much damage to the profession, that it will take a generation to fix, if at all.""",Police

Along with Davis, McCarthy had picked Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Jim Banks of Indiana, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Troy Nehls of Texas to serve on the committee.

However, Pelosi rejected Jordan and Banks, both of whom are strong supporters of Trump, leading McCarthy to pull back all his selections.

Pelosi appointed just two Republicans to the panel, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Neither of Pelosi's appointments are Trump supporters.

Davis told Newsmax Saturday that the American people want balance and fairness, but that is not what they are getting from the panel that was seated.

""They don't want something that has been put together by one side and having nothing more than a partisan argument,"" Davis said.

Meanwhile, Davis said Thursday night's prime-time committee hearing didn't attract ""much more than a normal viewership of the nightly news"" and that the group ""failed miserably to give the American people any new information. Therefore, no one watched.""

newsmax,Police,13873,newsmax,"The Justice Department is firing back Thursday at former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's request for a 45-day continuance to hire representation for his contempt of Congress charge.

A DOJ filing in the case to outline opposition to the request for a continuance claims Navarro's filing made ""numerous misrepresentations and provides no justification"" for the delay. Among the disputed allegations were the conditions of his arrest, having been denied counsel or food or water.

""The defendant bases his request for a continuance, in part, on his accusations that the government is attempting to deprive him of counsel — for example, by allegedly denying him a call to counsel upon his arrest and filing motions in the normal course of proceeding with this case,"" the DOJ wrote.

""The defendant's claims are false. 1. The defendant was arrested on June 3, 2022. At the time of his arrest, the defendant first requested to call the press, which was denied. 2. When the arresting agent then informed the defendant that arrangements could be made for him to call an attorney as soon as the defendant provided an attorney's name, the defendant did not provide the name of any attorney.""

Included in the filing were details of Navarro's arrest as he was set to make a flight to Nashville, Tennessee.

After being read his Miranda rights, the report read: ""Navarro said words to the effect, 'Do I get to make a call?' [Special agent Walter] Giardina asked, 'Do you have an attorney you'd like to call? What is the name of your attorney?'

""Navarro replied, 'I'm supposed to be on live television tonight. I'd like to call the producer and tell him I'm not going to be there. Can I have my phone?'""

Giardina said he could not have his phone until after his initial appearance, but he could call his attorney if he provided his attorney's name, but he did not.

The filing added, ""Navarro made statements to the effect that the arresting agents were 'kind Nazis' and 'how do you live with yourselves?'""

Navarro noted in his Wednesday filing his arrest came just three days after he sued the House Jan. 6 Select Committee and a federal prosecutor to block the subpoena seeking him to provide testimony and documents on what he considers privileged communications with then-President Donald Trump.

""I remind the court here that upon my arrest, the FBI agent in charge refused to allow me to contact an attorney for legal advice prior to appearing before the magistrate despite repeated requests and then tried to cover his tracks by providing a public defender a mere three minutes before the hearing was scheduled to begin,"" Navarro wrote in his request to Judge Amit Mehta. ""This put me at a very severe disadvantage at the outset.""",Police
newsmax,Police,15465,newsmax,"Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., said Democrats are weaponizing the IRS and steamrolling the American people by passing the Inflation Reduction Act.

""It's atrocious. It's a terrible bill,"" he said on Newsmax's ""Spicer & Co.""

""You know, giving $80 billion to the IRS to increase their ranks by 87,000 agents and you know who's going to get audited? It's going to be those of us, the small business owners and those earning under $400,000 are going to get the brunt of those audits. The Democrats say that's not true, but we know better.""

The IRS currently has about 80,000 employees, including clerical workers, customer service representatives, enforcement officials and others. The agency has lost roughly 50,000 employees over the past five years due to attrition, according to the IRS. More than half of the IRS employees who work in enforcement are currently eligible for retirement, said Natasha Sarin, the Treasury Department’s counselor for tax policy and implementation.

The IRS-related money in the Inflation Reduction Act is intended to boost efforts against high-end tax evasion, Sarin said.

The nearly $80 billion for the IRS in the bill will also pay for other improvements, such as revamping the agency's technology, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center and former Treasury official.

Clyde said the bill's passage Friday in the House was ""a sad day for America.""

""You see the big government socialist agenda steamrolling the American people, and they're using the IRS to do it. They will weaponize the IRS with all these agents, which is why we have to take the House back in November to stop this.""

Clyde also said the bill adds $130 billion to the national debt.

""That's unacceptable, it's inexcusable, it's fiscally irresponsible. But that's the way the Democrats are running this country, which is why there has to be a change in leadership.""

newsmax,Police,14478,newsmax,"President Biden on Monday addressed the ""senseless"" mass shooting in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park, which resulted in six deaths and 24 reported injuries.

""Jill [Biden] and I are shocked by this senseless gun violence that has yet again brought grief to an American community on this Independence Day,"" the president's statement read.

Police have confirmed that suspect in the Fourth of July parade shooting — who is still at large at the time of this writing — used a ""high-powered rifle,"" which has since been recovered by law enforcement.

Regarding the suspect's whereabouts, however, police have reportedly extended the manhunt to all parts of suburban Chicago. The president has already promised federal resources to assist in the manhunt.

The suspect has been described as a white man about 18 to 20 years old, according to Commander Chris O'Neill of the Highland Park Police Department.

And Christopher Covelli, spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, said the attacker apparently opened fire from a rooftop.

At the time, Covelli couldn't confirm from which building the shooting had occurred.

Citing previous Newsmax reports, shots first rang out about 10 minutes after the parade began at 10 a.m. Central time, sending hundreds of people fleeing and caused the event to abruptly end in panic.

Authorities urged people to continue to ""shelter in place"" as the search for the assailant continued.

The Chicago Tribune reported that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker had been attending the holiday parade.

On Monday, Biden also vowed to continue fighting the ""epidemic of gun violence.""

Biden also touted the bipartisan gun reform bill that recently passed in the House and Senate chambers, but he added that even more work must be done by lawmakers.",Police
newsmax,Police,11194,newsmax,"The Las Vegas Sun on Wednesday updated an editorial about the apparent Black Lives Matter activist's shooting of a mayoral candidate in which it discussed ''a rise in threats against politicians fueled by increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans,'' according to Fox News.

The incident happened in Louisville, Kentucky, where Quintez Brown, a BLM activist who was involved in protests after city police officers killed Breonna Taylor during a botched drug raid in her apartment in March 2020, is accused of shooting Craig Greenberg at his campaign office Monday.

Greenberg, a Democrat, was unharmed. Brown was charged with attempted murder and four counts of wanton endangerment, a police spokeswoman said.

''When we greeted him, he pulled out a gun, aimed directly at me and began shooting,'' Greenberg said at a news conference.

The Sun's editorial, ''Escalating hateful rhetoric leads nation down a dark, chaotic path,'' initially read: ''While there's been no indication yet that the activist had ties to any right-wing organizations, the shooting comes amid a rise in threats against politicians fueled by increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans.''

The updated piece reads: ''While it's been reported that the activist was involved in the Black Lives Matter and gun-safety movements and there has been no indication yet that he had ties to any right-wing organizations, the shooting comes amid a rise in threats against politicians fueled by increasingly violent rhetoric coming from extremist Republicans.''

The outlet does not intend to change the language again.

''We did not contend the shooter was associated with Republicans or right wing or was responding directly to right wing calls to violence,'' Bob Cauthorn, the outlet's chief operating officer, told the Daily Caller.

''We made that clear in all versions of the editorial. And our point about the way the rhetoric being used by some right wing extremists and some Republicans contributes to an environment in America where acts of political violence become more likely still stands.''",Police
newsmax,Police,14097,newsmax,"President Joe Biden's fall from his bicycle Saturday, when combined with other incidents that have happened since his election, is ""just another piece of the puzzle"" that shows he's ""not well and that he isn't running the country,"" even if the mainstream media is not talking about it, former ambassador Ric Grenell told Newsmax.

""You look at the Twitter feeds today of all the Washington, D.C., types, and there's very few talking about Joe Biden falling off a stationary bike,"" Grenell who served as acting director of National Intelligence under former President Donald Trump, said on Newsmax's ""The Count."" ""They just are trying to cover for the ruling party wherever they can. It's a joke.""

Biden, 79, fell off his bike while riding with first lady Jill Biden and their Secret Service agents near his Rehoboth Beach home in Delaware. They were finishing their morning ride when the president pedaled to a crowd of well-wishers.

Biden was wearing a helmet and took the spill when he tried to get off his bike and got his foot caught on the toe cages of his bike's pedal. He was not injured in the mishap.

But Grenell said that the United States' friends and adversaries are watching such incidents and ""they're seeing the decline of Joe Biden.""

""Everybody knows this,"" he said. ""No one is allowed to say it in Washington, D.C., but everybody else sees it.""

He acknowledged that falling off a bike while getting a foot caught in a pedal is ""what happens to normal people,"" and if Biden's fall was a lone incident, ""we wouldn't be able to string this together.""

But, Grenell added, the incident comes with the president ""falling up stairs. (We've) seen a shuffle, seen him shake hands with the air, seen him lose cognitive function in the middle of a speech ... and today's episode is just another piece of that puzzle that Joe Biden is not well and that he isn't running the country.""

He further pointed out that he's ""said it before"" that Susan Rice, the director of the United States Domestic Policy Council, and Chief of Staff Ron Klain ""are manipulating all of the policy, and he's out there just speaking.""

Grenell on Saturday also spoke out against the ongoing hearings of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 incidents at the Capitol, calling the proceedings a ""total joke.""

""You have to suspend what Donald Trump said,"" Grenell said. ""He was quite clear about peaceful protests, and isn't that what we constantly heard from the left when the BLM (Black Lives Matter) riots were going on? I mean, you could see fire and riots behind individuals who are saying, 'Behind me is a peaceful protest.'""

But Washington, D.C., is ""living in its world,"" he added, and Americans are seeing ""elements of fascism and totalitarianism beginning to take hold in Washington.""

The Washington bureaucrats, big tech and all are ""the same thing,"" he continued. ""They're all for the Democrats. It's all one big group think from the people in power. And so those of us who are on the outside are looking at what's happening and saying they're living in their own world, and a day of reckoning is coming.""

He noted that what he means by that is that on Election Day, ""we take back the House and the Senate. And then two years later, there's going to be a Republican roaring back into Washington. And at that point, we just go for broke and we start cutting government down to size.""

newsmax,Police,14406,newsmax,"GOP lawmakers on the House Judiciary and Oversight Committee on Thursday demanded a briefing from Washington, D.C., Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser on the city's rising crime and suggested she be held accountable for ""soaring crime and deteriorating conditions.""

""For over a year, Republicans have raised concerns about D.C.'s soaring crime and deteriorating conditions,"" Reps. James Comer (Kentucky) and Jim Jordan (Ohio) wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained exclusively by The Washington Times. ""The D.C. government, however, has ignored all requests for information. It is past time you take action to restore order to the nation's capital.""

Crime has been rising in Washington, D.C., since 2020.

Homicides in the district have increased 16% this year, according to D.C. Police Union Chair Gregg Pemberton.

""This increase in crime is due to the D.C. Council's implementation of misguided 'police reform' legislation,"" Pemberton said. ""The council's actions have had a chilling effect on professional and responsible policing.

""Other major cities that have passed similar legislation have also experienced the mass departure of police personnel and, as a result, surges in crime. While the council does its business inside a building protected by armed security, police officers in the real world are unable to do the impactful and necessary tasks needed to protect the public and apprehend violent criminals.""

Comer said Bowser ""must be held accountable for not taking the actions needed to restore order in our nation's capital and ensure the safety of all citizens who live in or visit D.C.""

""All Americans should feel safe in their capital city, but radical left-wing policies have enabled rampant crime in the District of Columbia,"" he added.",Police
newsmax,Police,12363,newsmax,"A majority of U.S. voters believe that America's violent crime problem is getting worse, and that President Joe Biden has not done much to help matters.

According to the latest Rasmussen Reports poll, 61% of likely U.S. voters believe that violent crime is on the rise, and 47% believe that Biden has done a poor job of handling law enforcement issues.

A full 81% of respondents said they believe the issue will be important in the November midterm elections, including 46% who said it will be very important.

Just 11% think the crime problem is getting better, while 26% think it's staying about the same.

According to the poll, 80% of Republicans and 64% of voters unaffiliated with either major political party think the violent crime problem is getting worse, and 40% of Democrats say the same.

While 65% of Democrats rate Biden excellent or good for his handling of crime and law enforcement issues, only 14% of Republicans and 23% of unaffiliated voters agreed.

But 72% of Republicans and 54% of unaffiliated voters give Biden a poor rating for his handling of crime, as well as 17% of Democrats.

Voters of all political stripes believe the issue of violent crime will be at least somewhat important in this year's congressional elections, with 88% of Republicans, 78% of Democrats, and 76% of unaffiliated voters saying they expect it to be a factor.

Voters making less than $30,000 annually are most likely to say the crime problem is getting worse, according to the poll.

More men than women, 50% to 44%, gave Biden poor marks for his handling of crime, and more men than women, 49% to 42%, said they expect crime to be a very important issue in the midterms.

Voters 65 and older are most likely to say that the problem of violent crime is getting worse, according to the survey, while voters under 40 are less likely than older age groups to give Biden a poor grade for his handling of crime and law enforcement issues.

A majority of voters are concerned by some of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's responses during her confirmation hearings, but most Democrats think Biden's pick for the Supreme Court was disrespected by Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Nearly two-thirds of voters say the Hunter Biden laptop story is important and believe the president was probably involved in his son's foreign business dealings.

newsmax,Police,15976,newsmax,"An attorney with close ties to the Oath Keepers was arrested Thursday and charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to federal prosecutors.

Kellye SoRelle, 43, was charged on four counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of justice, obstruction of an official proceeding – i.e. certification of the 2020 Electoral College results -- and entering restricted grounds, according to papers filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

SoRelle was arrested in Junction, Texas, following an indictment in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, CNN reported. She was expected to appear in court in Austin, Texas, later Thursday.

The lawyer was photographed with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes outside of the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, CNN said.

Rhodes and several members of the Oath Keepers are charged with seditious conspiracy. Their trial is set to begin Sept. 27.

SoRelle's connections to the Oath Keepers have appeared in court filings, including regarding a 2020 virtual meeting a week after the presidential election. The court records said that Oath Keepers talked about traveling to Washington in the meeting.

According to prosecutors, Rhodes had warned his group to prepare for a ""bloody and desperate fight"" in the days leading up to the Capitol assault.

In May, an Oath Keepers member admitted to engaging in seditious conspiracy during the Capitol attack.

William Todd Wilson, of North Carolina, pleaded guilty during a federal court hearing in Washington. He was the third Oath Keepers defendant to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy and obstruction charges.

SoRelle in May told CNN that she had been cooperating with the Justice Department.

""I've done interviews. I've done everything. I'm helping them,"" SoRelle said, adding that she also handed over phones to investigators.

SoRelle does not represent any Oath Keepers in their criminal proceedings, CNN said.",Police
newsmax,Police,13077,newsmax,"Candidates backed by conservative political action committees (PACs) swept Texas school board elections held on Saturday, as last year’s nationwide pushback against critical race theory materializes into on-the-ground victories.

Among the big winners was the 1776 Project PAC, a group that defines itself as forwarding those who “want to reform our public education system by promoting patriotism and pride in American history.”

All 15 candidates endorsed by the PAC won their races across six school districts representing suburban Dallas, Fort Worth, and Houston, the group announced through Twitter.

“The election victories are evidence parents are still motivated to transform public education,” 1776 Project founder Ryan Girdusky told Newsmax on Monday. “For decades, conservatives sat out of these important elections – and we’re happy that the 1776 Project PAC could play a small part in these victories.”

Girdusky highlighted during an interview with Breitbart that his organization has a perfect record so far this year, and he hopes to continue the success with the upcoming school board elections in Georgia and Maryland.

Another group that found success over the weekend was Grapevine-based Patriot Mobile, a cellphone company that poured half a million into a PAC to support candidates in Tarrant County school districts, according to The Texas Tribune.

Out of 11 endorsed candidates by Patriot Mobile Action, 10 won their races.

“It’s a sign that the issues we’re prioritizing are the ones that win elections,” Texas GOP chair Matt Rinaldi said of the conservative victories to The Dallas Morning News. “You’re gonna see us broaden the scope of the number of races we will be involved in in the future.”

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, also touted the victories through his Twitter account on Sunday.

“Parents are more involved and active in school elections and school policies than ever before,” Abbott wrote. “No one cares more about children than their parents. The power of parents will continue to expand in Texas.”",Police
newsmax,Police,11884,newsmax,"It is beyond ironical to have the corruption of the Biden ""crime family"" with Ukraine and Russia and now to be living on the edge of world war due to those same countries, Ohio Senate Republican primary candidate J.D. Vance lamented on Newsmax.

""Why is it that the very government that got involved with the Biden administration is now involved in a major world, a historic, crisis that [President Joe] Biden has blundered us into?"" Vance told Saturday's ""Wake Up America.""

The corruption extends beyond even the president, his son Hunter Biden, and the Big Tech censorship to suppress it in a 2020 presidential election meddling campaign, Vance added to co-host Carl Higbie, noting the media was complicit and biased, too.

""Can you imagine if Don [Trump] Jr. had taken a half a million dollars from a foreign government and then his dad had gotten us into a major foreign policy crisis involving that very same government?"" Vance continued. ""I suspect we'd be hearing howls of protest from the media. We'd be hearing calls for congressional investigation, which is exactly what we should be doing right now.""

Former President ""Donald Trump would still be president"" if Big Tech did not censor the Biden corruption during the 2020 presidential election campaign, according to Vance.

""It doesn't justify Russia invading the country in the first place, but you know, frankly, if The New York Times and other media outlets had told the honest truth about Biden's corruption, we may not be in this crisis to begin with, because Donald Trump would still be president if Big Tech hadn't effectively trying to steal the election from the guy,"" Vance said.

Also, Vance noted, it is not just the Russia-Ukraine war either. Biden has a number of crises he and his administration has caused.

""It's effectively a crime family that we've allowed to plunder the country, to turn our country into a total disaster area,"" Vance said. ""That's unfortunately [why] we're living with the consequences today.

""The other thing that's crazy about this is the media and social media, Big Tech engaged in this massive cover-up. If you were talking about this 12, 18 months ago, you were engaged in Russian disinformation, right. The tech companies would censor you for even discussing it.""

And, finally, Biden has left the U.S. military unprepared for the World War III it is perpetuating, Vance concluded.

""Our leaders have allowed our military to fall behind technologically,"" Vance said. ""This should be a massive wake-up call to those of us in the Senate, those of us running for the Senate, those of us who want to serve this country.

""We cannot fall behind China and Russia technologically because you've got people like [White House Joint Chiefs of Staff] Mark Milley focusing on white rage instead of building the highest tech military in the world. We are falling behind. It's time to wake up to that fact.""

Vance is running in a hotly contested Ohio Senate GOP primary where Trump has yet to officially endorse a candidate. Ohio is a bellwether state for the 2024 presidential election and remains a key battleground for the 2022 midterms as control of the House and Senate is up for grabs this November.
