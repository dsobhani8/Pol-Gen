bbc,Abortion,"A draft opinion from Justice Samuel Alito said the majority of the court's judges favoured overturning the ruling known as Roe v Wade which in 1973 established a woman's right to an abortion.

What will happen if Roe v Wade is overturned?

Instead it would be up to each state to decide how much access women living there would have to abortion.

But other states will continue to provide access, not just for women in their state but for those living in states where it will be banned.

There are 13 states that have so-called trigger laws in place, which would lead to an immediate ban if the Supreme Court rules to overturn Roe v Wade.

Another dozen or so may move quickly to ban or severely limit access, says the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice group. It estimates 36 million women of reproductive age would live in states without abortion access.

These states are mostly in the south and west, which means some women may have to travel long distances to find a clinic.

What does the US public think about Roe v Wade?

A majority of Americans (62%) told Pew Research in 2019 that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Only 38% said it should be illegal in all or most cases.

In that poll, 62% of those asked said they wanted it kept in place and only 38% said they wanted it struck down.

Why is this all happening now?

That changed the political leaning of the court to one that was more sceptical about Roe v Wade and more supportive of restricting access to abortions.

bbc,COVID,"With the holiday season approaching in the US, doctors are urging people to exercise caution to avoid a surge in common and potentially dangerous winter viruses.

The US is facing a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with some hospitals opening extra beds to treat patients, while there are concerns about other illnesses such as flu.

Winnie Chow, a parent to ten-month old Cooper, took her son to hospital earlier this month after he had been vomiting and coughing for several days. He spent four days there recovering from RSV.

""I was in tears,"" said Ms Chow, who lives in Hackensack, New Jersey. ""For him to be there for more than a day was very scary.""

Ms Chow is one of many parents who have had to seek care for an unwell child as winter viruses arrive earlier and with more severity than in recent years - a trend experts say could persist as people gather indoors for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

""When you have multiple generations mingling together, you have an increased risk of transmission from someone who is handling the virus pretty well to someone who may not handle it well at all.""

What is RSV and what are the symptoms?

Symptoms include a cough, congestion, runny nose and fever as well as wheezing in young infants, according to Rachel Orscheln, the director of ambulatory paediatric infectious diseases at St Louis Children's Hospital.

For the most vulnerable, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, a condition that includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.

It can be difficult to distinguish between RSV, coronavirus and the flu because the respiratory viruses include many of the same symptoms and usually peak in winter.

Parents should reach out to their child's healthcare provider if they begin to have concerns, especially if they are experiencing worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing or are struggling to drink fluids, said Sonali Advani, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University's Division of Infectious Diseases.

Why are RSV and flu cases rising?

Experts say protective measures like social distancing, mask wearing and other hygiene practices from the coronavirus pandemic likely shielded some children from exposure to the flu and their first RSV infection, which most children normally experience by age two.

An earlier RSV season followed by more severe flu infections has created a ""perfect storm"" that is ""flooding our paediatric capacity"", said Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts.

He told the BBC a reduction in hospital beds for children during the coronavirus pandemic, which was intended to make space for adults who are more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid, had worsened the current problem.

Some experts said they were not optimistic the issues would resolve soon, as close contact during Thanksgiving and the rest of the winter holiday season could offer more opportunities for viral transmission.

Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection against some of the respiratory illnesses that are circulating, experts told the BBC.

US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was ""well-matched"" to the circulating strain, while White House Covid co-ordinator Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to ""make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table"".

He added that parents could also make sure any person serving food during large family gatherings is symptom-free and handling the food in a hygienic manner.","[5, 4, 7, 6]","['The article overall presents a neutral stance, primarily focusing on disseminating medical information to the general public.

""When you have multiple generations mingling together, you have an increased risk of transmission from someone who is handling the virus pretty well to someone who may not handle it well at all.""

What is RSV and what are the symptoms?

Symptoms include a cough, congestion, runny nose and fever as well as wheezing in young infants, according to Rachel Orscheln, the director of ambulatory paediatric infectious diseases at St Louis Children's Hospital.

For the most vulnerable, RSV can lead to bronchiolitis, a condition that includes a build-up of inflammation in the lungs and difficulty breathing. There is no vaccine for RSV but scientists are working on developing one.

It can be difficult to distinguish between RSV, coronavirus and the flu because the respiratory viruses include many of the same symptoms and usually peak in winter.

Parents should reach out to their child's healthcare provider if they begin to have concerns, especially if they are experiencing worsening symptoms, difficulty breathing or are struggling to drink fluids, said Sonali Advani, an assistant professor of medicine at Duke University's Division of Infectious Diseases.

Why are RSV and flu cases rising?

Experts say protective measures like social distancing, mask wearing and other hygiene practices from the coronavirus pandemic likely shielded some children from exposure to the flu and their first RSV infection, which most children normally experience by age two.

An earlier RSV season followed by more severe flu infections has created a ""perfect storm"" that is ""flooding our paediatric capacity"", said Daniel Rauch, the chief of Paediatric Hospital Medicine at Tufts Medicine in Massachusetts.

He told the BBC a reduction in hospital beds for children during the coronavirus pandemic, which was intended to make space for adults who are more vulnerable to severe illness from Covid, had worsened the current problem.

Some experts said they were not optimistic the issues would resolve soon, as close contact during the the winter holiday season could offer more opportunities for viral transmission.

Getting vaccinated against Covid and the flu offers one of the best forms of protection against some of the respiratory illnesses that are circulating, experts told the BBC.

US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci said the flu jab was ""well matched"" to the circulating strain, while White House Covid co-ordinator Dr Ashish Jha urged Americans to ""make protecting our loved ones an important part of the conversation we have around the Thanksgiving table"".

He added that parents could also make sure any person serving food during large family gatherings is symptom-free and handling the food in a hygienic manner.","[5, 4, 3, 8]","['The article presents a balanced and neutral narrative that focuses on the health implications of common winter viruses.

bbc,Immigration,"At the end of a year in which motherhood has been at the centre of impassioned debate in the US, a school in Texas for teenage mothers shows how young lives are being supported - and reshaped.

But Helen had also been moody and would easily find herself picking fights with family and friends. Then her period was late.

Soon, her friends shunned her, accusing her of using her pregnancy to ""get guys"" and the father of her child, a classmate, stopped talking to her.

From the outside, Lincoln Park looks like any other US high school - sandy brick, school buses parked out front and the American flag flying in the breeze.

Teen birth rates in the US have declined in the last three decades, but among young Hispanic women, it remains much more common than for the rest of the population.

Latinas have the highest teen pregnancy rates of any group, and experts warn that following a 2022 Supreme Court decision to strike down the federal protection to abortion, the numbers are likely to rise.

Almost all of the students at Lincoln Park High, which has exclusively served teen mothers since 2005, are aged between 14 and 19. All of them are Latina - a reflection of the city's 94% Hispanic population as well as its higher rates of teen pregnancies. Most are low-income, and a few are American-born Mexican residents who cross the border daily from Matamoros, Tamaulipas to attend classes in the US.

In a year when motherhood has sat at the heart of America's cultural and political conversation, Lincoln Park offers a glimpse of how it shapes the lives of young women already facing the challenges of this unexpected and monumental life change.

'Now I have to think about me and my baby'

The thing that convinced Helen to switch to Lincoln Park was that she could take her baby to the school, she said.

Speaking to the BBC between classes this June, Helen still looked every inch the shy, dark-eyed teenager she was in her black T-shirt and pale pink shorts.

But in her backpack next to her books and journals were diapers and baby clothes for her daughter, Jenine, now eight months old.

""It used to just be me, now I have to think about me and my baby,"" she said.

Some 70 students are enrolled at the school, although that number seesaws throughout the year as newly pregnant students join, and some young mothers choose to return to their previous schools postpartum.

At the time of the BBC's visit to Lincoln Park, seven middle school students under the age of 14 were enrolled, as well as three students who each have three children.

The curriculum is exactly the same as that of other schools in the district, and students are still expected to pass their classes. But the differences are in the details.

The school buses that transport some of the students all have car seats for their babies. In the mornings, students can pick up breakfast for themselves and for their child. Their babies can attend the school daycare free-of-charge.

The students are allowed excused absences for their children's doctor's appointments. In one classroom, the science teacher has a tall wardrobe in the corner of the room with baby clothes for the mothers who might need them.

Alexis, like Helen, was 15 when she found out she was pregnant. She used three at-home pregnancy tests and they all came out positive. Still in denial, she saw a doctor, who confirmed she would be having a baby boy.

""It was so hard on me,"" Alexis said. ""I didn't want to drop out because I knew it wasn't the correct way to handle it.""

Inside the classrooms, there is a deep sense of camaraderie and intimacy that is almost shocking to an outsider, though clearly very natural to the students and staff.

Alexis and her classmates turned to face the door, as one student walked in late to class. Visibly nearing the end of her pregnancy, she walked slowly, with a slight waddle. The girls all smiled, and Alexis reached her arm out as her classmate got closer.

Mr Arredondo is the most inexperienced of the class in childbearing - at least in terms of first-hand experience. But he has taught enough pregnant students to know a thing or two.

""When the girls tell you that you're going to need an epidural, what do you think?"" he asked.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for every 1,000 young women between the ages of 15 to 19, 15 gave birth in the year 2020. The data does not include birth rates for teenagers below the age of 15.

Even with the overall national decline, Texas remains above the national average and is consistently on the top-10 of states with high teen birth rates.

There are a myriad of factors that play a role in teen pregnancy rates, but in Texas, some experts cite the state's strict abortion laws and the fact that sex education is not required in schools.

As many as 58% of Texas public schools teach abstinence-only sex education, and 25% do not teach it at all, according to the liberal Texas Freedom Network, a religious and community leaders' group.

""As long as we don't share that information with them, then they're not getting educated,"" said Cynthia Cardenas, the Lincoln Park High School principal. ""They're not given the opportunity to choose whether they want the consequence or not.""

Teenagers in Texas who do become pregnant must navigate a complex public health system to access care or otherwise face some of the strictest abortion laws in the country if they choose to terminate a pregnancy.

Travelling out of state to receive abortion care is often not an option for low-income women, especially when they are underage.

Helen had early on in her pregnancy considered abortion or giving her daughter up for adoption. Her mother said she would support whatever decision she took.

""My baby is the best thing that happened to me,"" Helen said. Jenine, an active infant cared for at the daycare, wears a big different coloured bow around her head each day that matches her outfit. ""I have the love of my life in my hands, she's everything for me,"" her mother said.

Helen is just a year away from graduating high school. She dreams about going to college and being able to provide for her daughter.

But in truth, only about half of teen mothers finish high school, and even fewer go on to pursue a higher degree, according to the CDC.

Planting the seed of going to college

The struggles of motherhood are hard, especially early on. Studies show that becoming a teenage mother is a risk factor for depression. Women who became pregnant as teens make up more than half of all mothers on welfare.

The stresses of poverty and youth facing the mums at Lincoln Park cause some to become disinterested in school, or to think it will be impossible to pursue further education with a child.

At lunchtime, Alexis and three other students take turns sharing photos of their young children. One had just started walking and another had got a new haircut.

Ms Cardenas, who joins the girls at lunch most days, walked over to the group. Since most are one year away from graduating, she asks them if they have taken their college entrance exams.

""I was already accepted into one school, but I don't think I want to go to college,"" said Angela, a US-born student living in Mexico. She crosses the border every day to come to Lincoln Park, pushing her baby in a stroller along the pedestrian bridge that separates Brownsville from Matamoros. Her days start at 5am when she queues up south of the border.

But Alexis interjects to tell Angela what she had learnt from a recent college information session. ""They have a daycare there and if your kids are quiet, your baby can go to class with you,"" Alexis said.

As much as the odds are stacked against them, one of the goals at Lincoln Park is to try to ""plant that seed of going to college"" for the students, said Ms Cardenas. ""And become successful and teach their babies that they also have a way"".

""They don't know how to raise a baby sometimes,"" Ms Cardenas said. ""We hold their futures in our hands as educators. We have to do this the right way.""

'Whatever you put in now, you will reap the rewards'

But in the back of her mind, she has been thinking about the need and support for schools like Lincoln Park amid the changing political and social landscape following the Supreme Court's abortion decision this summer.

The decision is expected to uniquely and disproportionately impact teens, according to Child Trends, a US research group focused on the welfare of children. Teens are more likely to seek abortions, learn of pregnancies later and struggle for support.

""I've been thinking about the implications of the reversal of Roe vs Wade,"" Ms Cardenas said, noting that Hispanic women are one of the largest groups of abortion-seekers in the US.

""My hopes are that we promote sex education in middle school and high school and that we, educators, create a plan of action that will be followed if we have more teens having babies as a result [of Roe being overturned],"" she said.

""Not a lot of school districts offer schools like this,"" she added. ""If you ask me, is it needed? Yes. Even if we can make a difference in 10 girls lives, yes. These are girls who wouldn't make it through a regular campus.""

Clear glass cases in the school's halls display smiling pictures of previous classes of students who graduated. Each week a local professional comes to present to the students as part of a career guest speaker series.

""What you're doing by coming to school, being a mother and having children, that's hard,"" one presenter, a young woman, tells them.

""Know that whatever you put in now, you will reap the rewards.""","[5, 8, 7, 10]","['The article largely presents a compassionate perspective towards teenage mothers engaged in education in a Texas school setting, without conveying a specific political leaning definitively.

Their babies can attend the school daycare free-of-charge.""\n   - These points iteratively detail the unique supportive measures taken by the school to accommodate the young mothers, representing objective storytelling without a specific political leaning.\n\n5. ""There are a myriad of factors that play a role in teen pregnancy rates, but in Texas, some experts cite the state\'s strict abortion laws and the fact that sex education is not required in schools.""\n   - This statement paints a larger picture of how state laws, particularly restrictive abortion laws and lack of mandatory sex education in Texas, influence teen pregnancy rates. This critical analysis of state legislation points to an underlying theme commonly explored by both liberal and conservative demography.\n\n6. ""Teenagers in Texas who do become pregnant must navigate a complex public health system to access care or otherwise face some of the strictest abortion laws in the country if they choose to terminate a pregnancy.""\n   - This statement, while not explicitly biased, leans a bit left-wing as it highlights the difficulties young women face due to strict abortion laws, a point of critique commonly brought up by liberals advocating for reproductive rights. \n\n7. ""But in truth, only about half of teen mothers finish high school, and even fewer go on to pursue a higher degree, according to the CDC.""\n   - The statement, based on CDC data, exhibits neutrality by highlighting a fact regarding the ramifications of teen motherhood on education outcomes.\n\n8. ""The struggles of motherhood are hard, especially early on. Studies show that becoming a teenage mother is a risk factor for depression. Women who became pregnant as teens make up more than half of all mothers on welfare.""\n   - These statements emphasize the mental health and welfare struggles faced by teen mothers, providing neutral, data-driven insight into these issues.\n\n9. ""But in the back of her mind, she has been thinking about the need and support for schools like Lincoln Park amid the changing political and social landscape following the Supreme Court\'s abortion decision this summer.""\n   - While this quote does not explicitly support or critique the Supreme Court\'s abortion decision, it points out the potential increase in the necessity for schools like Lincoln Park, indirectly suggesting the potential social repercussions of conservative policy-making.\n\n10. """"If you ask me, is it needed? Yes. Even if we can make a difference in 10 girls lives, yes. These are girls who wouldn\'t make it through a regular campus.""""\n   - The focus on the importance of providing specialized education for teen mothers, regardless of the number it impacts, underlines a socially conscious perspective without divulging political bias.\n\nConclusively, this article maintains neutrality predominantly by affording an objective overview of the school for teen mothers in Texas, the experiences of the young mothers, and the broader societal and policy influences. Despite minor left-leaning instances concerning access to abortion, the article represents a balanced discussion with insights for conservative and liberal audiences.']",7.5,2.0816659994661326,1.0
bbc,Immigration,"When he took office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden declared that his ascension was the ""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy"".

Speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic, just weeks after the Capitol riot, he vowed to bring back unity and do ""great things"".

""We can right wrongs. We can put people to work in good jobs. We can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome this deadly virus,"" he said.

A year into his presidency, we take a look at what progress Mr Biden has made, his standing with the American public, and what it all means for the president going forward, with analysis from the BBC's North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.

How are his approval ratings?

Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance, according to RealClearPolitics, and having won more than 80 million votes - more than any other president.

His star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and as the Delta variant advanced.

Since then, his approval ratings have fallen further as he has struggled to deliver on his biggest campaign promises to tame the pandemic and restore prosperity for working families.

Compared with other recent presidents, only Donald Trump has had a more disappointing first year - his approval rating fell from 45% on his inauguration day to 35% a year later, according to historical trends by Gallup.

Mr Biden's former boss, Barack Obama, began at a high of nearly 70% when he took office and ended close to 50% a year later. George W Bush began his first term in a similar position to Mr Biden, with approval around 60%, but that rose to nearly 90% after 9/11.

Anthony Zurcher: It's hard to say that the honeymoon is over for Joe Biden because he never really had one. His ratings started modestly positive, without the kind of big inaugural bump most presidents (not named Donald Trump) receive. Now his numbers are in the danger zone for first-term presidents hoping to win re-election - a reflection of near universal Republican dislike and a majority of independents who are souring on him.

Has he got the pandemic under control?

President Biden, who says he carries a card in his pocket with the number of Americans killed by the virus, has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his top priority.

In his first year, he has expanded vaccine availability and currently, about 75% of the US has had at least one dose, and 63% are fully vaccinated. Children as young as 5 have been eligible for the vaccine since November, 80 million booster doses have been administered to help protect against Omicron, and free at-home rapid tests have just become available to order this week.

But the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over. Over the course of the year, the US has undergone three major waves of the virus, and more than 850,000 Americans have died from Covid - the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden declared in a July speech that the US could celebrate ""independence"" from the Covid-19 pandemic. That may sit next to George W Bush's Iraq War ""mission accomplished"" banner in the hall of premature presidential victory declarations. While the White House will get credit for enacting a massive pandemic relief bill in May, its inability to prepare for the challenges presented by the Delta and Omicron variants have turned what seemed like looming success into a long, hard slog.

How has the US economy fared under his watch?

For many Americans, the number one issue facing the country is the economy. When Mr Biden took office, the pandemic had slowed job growth and the US had faced unemployment woes due to lockdown.

Employment rebounded somewhat over the last year, with 6.4 million jobs added. Though total employment remains lower than its pre-pandemic level, jobless claims have dropped to a near 50-year low.

Millions of Americans have quit their jobs. Though this shows confidence in the job market, some industries now face a labour shortage, contributing to global supply-chain problems and fuelling rocketing inflation.

Anthony Zurcher: Mr Biden took office as the US economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns. The good news for him was falling unemployment, a booming stock market and record-setting growth. The bad news is that the velocity of the rebound led to supply-chain struggles and inflation levels not seen in decades. If the economy can shake those negative aspects off, his record will look good - but the problems have not been as ""transitory"" as the administration promised.

Has he delivered on immigration reforms?

One of Mr Biden's promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border, a Trump-era policy that angered the left.

The president kept his word on ending the so-called ""zero-tolerance"" policy, and the number of minors held in detention centres has plummeted.

But since he took office, the US has seen an influx of migrants that has created new challenges. In 2021, there were almost 2 million encounters between migrants and US border officers, including 165,000 involving minors.

Long-term reforms remain elusive. Mr Biden's plan to offer legal status to an estimated 11 million undocumented people in the US has stalled in Congress, and he failed to overturn a Trump-era policy that made migrants wait in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard in the US.

Meanwhile, he has defended the use of a Trump policy that lets the government automatically expel undocumented asylum seekers in order to stop the spread of Covid-19. He used the so-called Title 42 policy to kick 4,000 Haitians out of Texas, drawing widespread condemnation.

Anthony Zurcher: There was always going to be an uptick in undocumented border crossings after the pandemic depressed migration levels for much of 2020. What was somewhat unexpected was that Mr Biden's immigration reforms - the ones he delivered on - super-charged the migratory crisis, swamping US border facilities unprepared for the surge. The result is that few people have been satisfied with the outcomes.

What are his accomplishments?

Despite opposition from Republicans and a fractured Democratic caucus, he managed to pass a $1tn infrastructure bill in November.

A longer term accomplishment may be his prolific appointment of judges - he has named more in his first year than any president since Ronald Reagan.

However, Mr Biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn't help him push his voting reforms through Congress. It wasn't the first time. Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin, moderate Democrats in key swing states, have also held back his social-spending bill and climate agenda.

Anthony Zurcher: A lot of the focus over the past year has been on what Mr Biden hasn't accomplished in Congress versus what his administration has succeeded in pushing through. As any parent knows, making a promise you can't keep is a great way to provoke a temper tantrum. Mr Biden spread a lot of promises out on the campaign trail, some of which were unrealistic or depended on circumstances beyond his control. Now he's facing an electorate whose temper is starting to flare.","[6, 10, 7, 7]","['The article analyses President Joe Biden\'s first year in office, focusing on his approval ratings, pandemic control efforts, the US economy under his leadership, immigration reforms, and his accomplishments. The overall tone leans towards a neutral perspective, presenting both criticisms and praises of the president\'s performance. However, a few instances might hint at a right-leaning slant due to the focus on Biden\'s struggles and the setbacks he faced.\n\n1. ""Speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic, just weeks after the Capitol riot, he vowed to bring back unity and do \'great things\'.""\n   - The quote paints a picture of a divided country, implying that Biden has faced a significant challenge since assuming office. The neutral perspective allows for individual interpretations depending on the reader\'s ideological leaning.\n\n2. ""His star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and as the Delta variant advanced.""\n   - This statement focuses on the negative aspects of Biden\'s presidency, suggesting a more right-leaning perspective as it aligns with criticisms often brought forth by conservatives.\n\n3. ""Over the course of the year, the US has undergone three major waves of the virus, and more than 850,000 Americans have died from Covid - the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic.""\n   - This quote frames the Biden administration\'s struggle in combating the Covid-19 pandemic, a perspective which frequently arises in right-wing discourse criticizing the perceived inefficiency in the handling of the pandemic.\n\n4. ""Mr Biden took office as the US economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns. The good news for him was falling unemployment, a booming stock market and record-setting growth. The bad news is that the velocity of the rebound led to supply-chain struggles and inflation levels not seen in decades.""\n   - The contrast between the positive and negative impacts on the economy under Biden could be seen as maintaining a neutral stance. However, the emphasis on \'bad news\' and the mention of decades-high inflation rates could resonate with a more conservative audience critical of his handling of the economy.\n\n5. ""But since he took office, the US has seen an influx of migrants that has created new challenges. In 2021, there were almost 2 million encounters between migrants and US border officers, including 165,000 involving minors.""\n   - By highlighting the challenges faced by the US due to an influx of migrants under Biden\'s administration, this piece illustrates the challenges of immigration reform, an issue which is often accentuated by right-leaning platforms.\n\n6. ""However, Mr Biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn\'t help him push his voting reforms through Congress. It wasn\'t the first time.""\n   - This segment focuses on Biden\'s struggles even within his party, which could align with the right-wing narrative that emphasizes political disunity within the Democratic Party.\n\nIn conclusion, while the article maintains a largely neutral perspective in conveying a balanced view of the President\'s performance, the emphasis on Biden\'s challenges, setbacks, and struggles might suggest a subtle right-leaning perspective. However, the article does not overtly favor one ideology over another, instead leaving room for readers to form their own interpretations.', 'The article comes across as having a neutral-leaning perspective as it appears to balance praises and criticism towards the Biden administration. \n\n1. ""When he took office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden declared that his ascension was the ""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy""."" \n   - This neutral statement quotes President Biden\'s inaugural address, providing valuable context for the reader without providing a personal opinion or inherent bias.\n\n2. ""Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance...""\n   - This again is a neutral statement that simply reports statistical data around President Biden\'s approval rating early in his term.\n\n3. ""Since then, his approval ratings have fallen further as he has struggled to deliver on his biggest campaign promises to tame the pandemic and restore prosperity for working families.""\n   - This line is slightly critical but maintains a neutral stand as it offers a factual critique of Biden\'s approval ratings and his struggles to deliver on certain campaign promises.\n\n4. ""But the rise of variants and continued opposition to vaccines by some mean the pandemic is far from over.""\n   - The article neutrally presents the ongoing challenges in fighting the pandemic, without specifically blaming or praising any political party.\n\n5. ""Employment rebounded somewhat over the last year, with 6.4 million jobs added.""\n   - The language used here is neutral, presenting facts about employment growth over the past year under President Biden\'s administration.\n\n6.

Though this shows confidence in the job market, some industries now face a labor shortage, contributing to global supply-chain problems and fueling rocketing inflation.""\n   - This passage maintains neutrality by objectively describing a complex situation in the American job market and attributing it to various factors, not directly linking it to any political decisions.\n\n7. ""One of Mr Biden\'s promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border, a Trump-era policy that angered the left.""\n   - The language offers a factual representation of Biden\'s campaign promise and contrasts his approach with policies under the previous administration without injecting bias.\n\n8. ""Mr Biden took office as the US economy was beginning to emerge from a year of pandemic lockdowns. The good news for him was falling unemployment, a booming stock market, and record-setting growth.""\n   - This neutral statement recognizes the positive economic performance that Biden inherited at the start of his presidency.\n\n9. ""Despite opposition from Republicans and a fractured Democratic caucus, he managed to pass a $1tn infrastructure bill in November.""\n   - This statement neutrally recognizes a legislative success of Biden\'s administration, acknowledging the obstacles he overcame without leaning towards praising or critiquing him.\n\n10. ""However, Mr Biden was dealt a major blow this week when members of his own party made it clear they wouldn\'t help him push his voting reforms through Congress.""\n   - The article neutrally presents a setback for Biden, noting opposition not only from Republicans but also from within his own Democratic party. This presents a balanced view of the challenges facing Biden\'s administration from across the political spectrum.\n\nIn summary, the article provides a balanced assessment of President Biden\'s first year in office, highlighting both his accomplishments and shortcomings without leaning definitively towards a right or left wing perspective. It aims to provide a factual overview of Biden\'s presidency, thus appealing to a broad readership interested in observing the outcomes of his administration\'s policies.', 'This article tends to lean towards left-wing ideologies, primarily owing to its focus on narrating and attempting to justify or explain the struggles and achievements of President Joe Biden\'s administration.\n\n1. ""When he took office as the 46th US president, Joe Biden declared that his ascension was the ""triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause - the cause of democracy"".""\n   - The use of this quote sets a rather positive tone acknowledging Biden\'s vision, and its emphasis on democracy aligns with left-wing values that highlight equality and representativeness.\n\n2. ""Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance, according to RealClearPolitics, and having won more than 80 million votes - more than any other president.""\n   - This statement emphasizes Biden\'s popular support and electorally achieving success, painting a favorable picture of the Democratic party and inclining towards the left.\n\n3. ""In his first year, he has expanded vaccine availability and currently, about 75% of the US has had at least one dose, and 63% are fully vaccinated.""\n   - Celebrating the achievements of Biden\'s administration in tackling the pandemic, this statement reflects a positive view of Democratic actions.\n\n4. ""For many Americans, the number one issue facing the country is the economy. When Mr Biden took office, the pandemic had slowed job growth and the US had faced unemployment woes due to lockdown.""\n   - Although it confirms economic issues, it does so by providing context that these problems were linked to the challenging conditions that Biden inherited, indicating a sympathetic view towards the administration.\n\n5. ""One of Mr Biden\'s promises while running for office was to end the separation of migrant families and detention of children at the border, a Trump-era policy that angered the left.""\n   - Highlighting immigration reform attempts speaks to left-leaning ideologies that favor humane treatment of migrants.\n\n6. ""Despite opposition from Republicans and a fractured Democratic caucus, he managed to pass a $1tn infrastructure bill in November.""\n   - Painting Biden as a persevering figure who overcame opposition achievements leans to the left by emphasizing successful policy enactment.\n\n7. ""A longer term accomplishment may be his prolific appointment of judges - he has named more in his first year than any president since Ronald Reagan.""\n   - This statement underlines Biden\'s action in influencing the judiciary, which is viewed favorably by the left, indicating an ideology lean towards that end.\n\nIn conclusion, the article emphasizes the struggles of the Biden administration, but it also focuses on the progress made. It scrutinizes through a lens of sympathy and understanding in a manner that suggests a left-wing bias. It captures the challenges the administration faces but steers the narrative towards Biden\'s advances, especially in areas like healthcare and immigration, which are typically progressive stances.', 'The article written is neutral and portrays a balanced view of President Biden\'s first year in office.

""Speaking to a divided country in the midst of a pandemic, just weeks after the Capitol riot, he vowed to bring back unity and do ""great things"".\n   - The reminder of the Capitol riot and the mention of unity in President Biden’s speech gives an indication of a left-leaning stance. The Capitol riot is usually linked to Trump supporters, and the call for unity counteracts the division caused.\n\n2. ""Despite a bitter presidential race, Mr Biden began his term with 56% of the country approving of his performance, according to RealClearPolitics, and having won more than 80 million votes - more than any other president.""\n   - The mention of Biden\'s initial approval rating and the record-breaking number of votes he received suggests a slight bias towards the Democrats.\n\n3. ""His star began to fall at the time of a widely criticised withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and as the Delta variant advanced.""\n   - Although the article mentions the drop in President Biden\'s approval rating and criticizes him for his actions, this is done in a factual and non-inflammatory manner, preserving the overall neutral tone. However, the choice to use the word ""advanced"" to describe the spread of the Delta variant subtly places the blame on external factors, nudging the article slightly towards left-wing ideologies.\n\n4. ""President Biden, who says he carries a card in his pocket with the number of Americans killed by the virus, has made it clear that tackling the pandemic is his top priority.""\n    - By emphasizing Biden\'s sentimentality and prioritizing of the pandemic, the article reflects a Democratic viewpoint.\n\n5. ""Employment rebounded somewhat over the last year, with 6.4 million jobs added.""\n    - The fact that the article discusses the positive aspects of the economy under Biden (job additions) even for a brief moment, before delving into the negatives (labor shortage, inflation) indicates a slight left-wing leaning.\n\n6.

bbc,Police,"If carried out, Cruz's death penalty will be one of only a handful of executions actually carried out every year in the US, where over 2,000 people are on death row. The US remains the only Western nation to allow capital punishment.

How will the jury decide if the gunman should get the death penalty?

In most criminal cases in the US, a jury determines culpability, and a judge decides on the punishment. But in this case, the jury will decide how he is sentenced.

If they don't give him the death penalty, the only other possible outcome for Cruz is life in prison without the possibility of parole. As per state law, however, the judge would still be able to sentence him to life in prison, even if the jury recommends that he be put to death.

In Florida, prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases where the accused has been convicted of first-degree murder with aggravating factors, which include previous felony convictions, murders that are ""especially heinous, atrocious or cruel"", creating ""a risk of death to many persons"" and ""cold, calculated"" murders that were premeditated.

During the trial - which is expected to last several months - prosecutors will seek to demonstrate the aggravating factors and premeditated nature of the shooting and its grisly outcome. This is likely to include eyewitness testimony from survivors and video taken at the crime scene, as well as a possible visit to the school.

What states have the death penalty?

So far this year, seven people have been executed by five states. The most recent execution saw a 66-year-old man put to death in Arizona for the 1984 murder of an eight-year-old girl.

DPIC's deputy director, Ngozi Ndulue, told the BBC that the US has seen ""really significant, continued erosion"" in the use and acceptance of the death penalty, largely because of concerns about innocent people being executed or that the death penalty is disproportionately applied to racial minorities.

Who is most likely to be executed?

According to statistics from DPIC published earlier this year, 41% of the people still on death row are black and 42% are white, despite the fact that black people make up about 12.4% of the US population.

Ms Ndulue said that the race of the victim is among the strongest factors in the application of the death penalty. Over 75% of the victims in murder cases that have resulted in executions have been white, statistics show.

While all the prisoners currently on death rows across the US have been convicted of murder, each US state has their own rules about capital punishment, who can get the death penalty and why.

In Texas, for example, prosecutors can seek the death penalty in cases where the accused has been convicted of homicide with aggravating factors, which range from murders committed for money or during an attempted kidnapping to the murders of police officers, firefighters or prison guards.

Six other states - including Texas and Oklahoma - also have laws on the books that allow for the death penalty to be sought in cases in which a minor was raped. To date, however, no death sentences have been handed down or carried out for this crime.

Lethal injections have been, and remain, the most common form of executions in the US, and were used in most executions that have taken place since 1976. In most states, it remains the only method available.

Some states, however, use other methods. In Arkansas and Florida, for example, inmates can be electrocuted if they submit a request in writing. Other states, such as Utah and Oklahoma, authorise firing squad deaths as methods of execution in cases where lethal injections are not available, or if sentenced before a certain date.

Later this year, South Carolina plans to execute convicted murderer Richard Moore by firing squad, which would mark the first time the method would be used anywhere in the US since 2010. In another case, the Supreme Court ruled in June that a Georgia inmate can die by firing squad after he argued that his veins were ""severely compromised"" and that he would suffer if given a lethal injection.

While state authorities have argued that lethal injections cause less pain and suffering than other methods, critics have argued that it possibly constitutes ""cruel and unusual"" punishment that would be contrary to the Eighth Amendment of the US constitution. The debate has seen intense legal wrangling and in 2015 reached the US Supreme Court, which ruled that condemned prisoners can only challenge the method with which they'd be executed if a viable alternative is provided.

Mr Garland, however, has come under pressure to make the death penalty available in the case of Payton Gendron, a suspected white supremacist charged with murdering 10 people in Buffalo, New York, on 14 May.

In March, the US Supreme Court re-imposed the death sentence for convicted Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, reversing an earlier appeals court ruling that voided it, arguing the judge in his original trial had failed to question potential jurors about how much they'd been following the case in the news.

Earlier in the year, then-White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration has ""grave concerns"" about whether the death penalty ""is consistent with the values that are fundamental to our sense of justice and fairness"".

The justice department, however, has defended the death sentence in Tsarnaev. Mr Garland's moratorium did not prevent prosecutors from continuing to seek capital punishment in the case.","[6, 8, 7, 6]","['The reporting style of this article comes across as fairly neutral, offering a detailed overview of the state of capital punishment in the US. \n\n1.

breitbart,Abortion,"A massive PR firm that represents high-profile corporations like Coca-Cola, AT&T, and Starbucks is privately advising its clients to remain silent on abortion rights, according to an internal email obtained by Popular Information.

With its top corporate clients – including Kia Motors, Astra Zeneca, and Pizza Hut, Zeno Group, a subsidiary of the world’s largest public relations conglomerate, Edelman Holdings, earns almost $120 million in annual revenue.

Zeno Group’s Executive Vice President for Media Strategy, Katie Cwayna, sent company staff “a template email to share with client contacts” with instructions on reacting to reports that the U.S. Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion rights decision.

According to the email, Zeno warned its clients that “the media” and others “will look for corporations to take a stand and make their views known.”

Zeno suggests its corporate clients remain silent on the issue because taking a public stance could be a “no-win” situation for companies.

Do not take a stance you cannot reverse, especially when the decision is not final. This topic is a textbook “50/50” issue. Subjects that divide the country can sometimes be no-win situations for companies because regardless of what they do they will alienate at least 15 to 30 percent of their stakeholders… Do not assume that all of your employees, customers or investors share your view.

Although the email paints abortion rights as a “50/50” issue, a recent poll found that a majority of Americans believe abortion should be either “mostly” or “always” illegal, and support banning abortion completely after 15 weeks.

Zeno continued to warn its clients to stay away from the media entirely. “Avoid media’ fishing.’ Often during controversy, media will make general inquiries to multiple peer organizations, in which the first one to “raise its hand” becomes the lead,” the email template continued. Zeno told its clients that being at the center of the abortion issue is “not advisable,” and to “be judicious” with managing press inquiries.

The email template also provided its clients with advice on talking to reporters, which is to avoid them.

“Steer clear of breaking news networks/outlets,” the email said. “We anticipate the story will dominate newsfeeds for the rest of the week as more details unfold, so avoid pitching reporters and outlets that focus on breaking news.”

Along with media silence on the issue, companies are being told to remain silent on their social media accounts as well.

“Do not engage with direct questions about your company’s position,” the email added. “Whether in direct messages or public-facing posts, do not respond to questions about where your company stands on this issue.”

Zeno Group also consults top brands such as ASICS, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Phillips Health, Corona, Prudential, and Leveno.

Zeno’s message to its corporate clients telling them to avoid the abortion debate can be summed up by the following mantra: “go woke, go broke.”

Zeno Group also consults Netflix, which is dealing with its own fallout after the company made a dedicated shift towards “wokeness.”

In the last half-year, Netflix’s stock price has fallen from $671 to $215, and subscribers are also leaving the platform en masse. As a result, Netflix now performs the worst out of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500.

The PR firm’s advice to stay silent on this hot button issue also comes after the highly contested feud between Disney and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over the state’s recently enacted Parental Rights in Education Law.

However, Zeno Group CEO Barby Siegel told Popular Information the company believes in “a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare,” after the report on the internal email was published.

“At Zeno, we believe in equal access to healthcare for all, and a woman’s right to make decisions about her healthcare,” Siegel said. “At the same time, we live in a world with different opinions and different views, and we respect those differences.”

Siegel also added that the email template “does not accurately reflect Zeno’s position or the range of counsel that we are providing to clients.” Siegel claimed the advice was provided within the first 24 hours after Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion was leaked and intended to ” counsel clients to be measured in their immediate response to a complex developing story.”","[6, 7, 7, 5]","['The article seems to show a relatively neutral stance overall, with a small lean towards a right-wing perspective, especially in instances that indicate skepticism towards ideologies associated with political correctness and \'wokeness.\'\n\n1.

breitbart,Abortion,"More Americans favor the idea of a 15-week abortion ban than oppose it, according to a new poll from the Wall Street Journal.

Nearly half — 48 percent — of 1,500 registered voters polled said they would “strongly or somewhat favor such restrictions, with exemptions to protect the health of the mother.” Forty-three percent of voters oppose the idea of a 15-week abortion ban. The results come as the Supreme Court considers whether to allow Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks gestation to stand.

“A total of 31 percent of voters said they strongly support a 15-week ban, while 17 percent were somewhat in support. Another 34 percent said they strongly opposed such a ban, and 10 percent said they were somewhat opposed,” according to the Journal.

However, 55 percent of voters reportedly say they want “abortion to be legal in all or most cases.” Thirty percent say abortion should be illegal except for cases that involve rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger. Eleven percent say abortion “should be illegal in all circumstances.”

“There are going to be hardened people on both ends,” Republican pollster Tony Fabrizi said. Fabrizi’s firm conducted the poll with Democrat pollster John Anzalone. “But most people are somewhere in between and a lot of people pick and choose.”

Unsurprisingly, 69 percent of Democrats polled say they are opposed to a 15-week abortion ban, while 21 percent say they support the ban. In contrast, 75 percent of Republicans support the ban and 20 percent oppose it.

The poll results are similar to other surveys taken in regards to how voters feel about limits on abortion. A Knights of Columbus/Marist Poll released on the eve of the 2022 March for Life revealed that 71 percent of Americans support legal limits on abortion. According to the poll’s results, 49 percent of Democrats support limits on abortion, while 93 percent of Republicans and 70 percent of independents support the same.

Another poll released by the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) in June 2021, after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the Mississippi case, found that 53 percent of likely voters say they are more likely to vote for a Republican candidate who supports a 15-week limit on abortion compared to 28 percent who would rather vote for a Democrat who backs unlimited abortion up until the time of birth.

The Wall Street Journal poll was conducted with 1,500 registered voters between March 2-7. The margin of error for the question about whether voters wanted abortion to be legal or illegal was plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and 3.6 percentage points for the question about the 15-week ban.

breitbart,COVID,"Randi Weingarten, the president of America’s largest teachers’ union, told CNN that keeping children masked in school is “absolutely the right way.”

Appearing on CNN’s Newsroom Thursday, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) leader applauded New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s (D) decision to maintain masking for children in schools until at least March while lifting virtually all other mask mandates in the state.

“I think I’m just going to lift up the one governor who I think is doing it absolutely the right way,” Weingarten said.

Hochul lifted New York’s mask mandates for businesses and most indoor public settings but excluded places where groups gather like public transit. She also excluded schools, despite the fact that children are at the lowest risk for negative effects of the coronavirus.

The Empire State’s governor has also advocated for children to get the vaccine and is not happy with the number of children in her state who have yet to get the shot. As such, she announced school districts will distribute testing kits and, given the results, make a determination on masks in schools.

New York parent and founder of “Keep NYC Schools Open” Daniella Jampel, a Democrat, said, “Starting today, maskless NYers can go to grocery stores, pharmacies, movie theaters, and just about anywhere else. Our kids, however, will spend 7 hours behind a mask, struggling to hear their friends and understand their teacher.”

Weingarten, who claims to care about the wellbeing of children, has used her organization as a driving force behind keeping schools closed and children masked, despite the ample and growing evidence that both have been absolutely detrimental for the social and educational development of children as well as their mental health. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation have all skyrocketed among children, as well as learning loss and underdeveloped speaking, reading, and writing capabilities.

In November 2020, AFT affiliated United Federation of Teachers pushed heavily for the shut down of New York City’s entire public school system.

Meanwhile, Weingarten also recently came under fire for saying on MSNBC that masking children in school can only end when there is “no transmission in schools.”

breitbart,COVID,"Republican Study Committee (RSC) member Rep. Diana Harshbarger (R-TN) proposed a bill Tuesday that would allow citizens to sue the federal government as well as state and local governments that may jeopardize one’s job with harsh coronavirus vaccine mandates, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.

Harshbarger’s bill would allow citizens who feel forced to take the coronavirus vaccines to bring civil actions for compensatory damages, including economic and non-economic damages, against the federal government and any state or local government that imposes a mandate that threatens one’s employment.

Harshbarger said in a statement that Americans should not have to choose between their jobs and their employment,

“The Biden Administration’s unconstitutional mandates forced many Americans to choose between their job or getting vaccinated. While this is wrong and never should have happened, those forced into vaccination should have full rights to pursue legal action if they are injured,” she explained. “My bill — the Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act — is a step in the right direction towards holding this administration and our government accountable.”

“The Left forced Americans into medical procedures against their will and simultaneously restricted their right to sue for injuries,” RSC Chairman Jim Banks (R-IN) said. “It’s unacceptable. If vaccine mandates are ethical, why do they require a legal carveout? The Protecting Americans’ Medical Rights Act will give Americans hurt by a medical decision they were forced into a real, substantive legal recourse.”

Reps. Banks, Bill Posey (R-FL), Dough LaMalfa (R-CA). Randy Weber (R-TX), Brian Babin (R-TX), Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Yvette Herrell (R-NM) are the original cosponsors of the legislation.

Under current law, Americans have few legal remedies to seek compensation for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates. Those seeking compensation generally have to use the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CPIP). This program has no court, judge, or right to appeal, and decisions are made solely by a bureaucratic administrator. Compensation for lost wages and death benefits are often arbitrarily capped, with no opportunity for collecting damages for pain and suffering, and a one-year statutory limit for making a claim. There is also no compensation for attorney fees, which makes it difficult for lower-income Americans to find legal counsel.

In contrast, Harshbarger’s legislation would let any citizen sue the federal government or any state or local government in a federal district court for relief and compensatory damages whose employment was impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates. It would also allow courts to award attorney’s fees to a citizen that wins in court.

Since the release of the coronavirus vaccines, and as of February 1, 2022, not one single American has been awarded compensation through CPIP for coronavirus-vaccine injury claims.

One study found that .3 percent of participants reported an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis after partial vaccination, and .2 percent experienced a negative reaction after full vaccination. The CDC maintains that less than one percent of those who received the Pfizer vaccine experienced a serious adverse effect.

The legislation’s “Congressional Findings” declare that coronavirus vaccine mandates are “authoritarian” and lack a “scientific basis” for public health needs:

Government-imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates that threaten Americans’ jobs and livelihoods are authoritarian, unnecessary, overreaching, irrational, needlessly divisive, and lack a purported scientific basis for public health needs. The policy of the United States is to recognize, defend, and protect the inherent rights of the individual, including the right of liberty, the right to be secure in one’s person, the right of the individual to be informed about any medical procedures, treatment, or vaccination, and the right of the individual to provide or withhold consent to such procedures, treatment, or vaccination. Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirm that while COVID-19 vaccination can lessen the severity of illness for individuals in certain higher-risk categories, it DOES NOT preclude Americans from contracting, spreading, or being hospitalized by the COVID-19 virus. The protection of individual rights to make one’s own medical decisions in consultation with his or her health care provider — without fear of coercion, forced vaccination, loss of civil liberties, or risk of adverse employment action — is especially needed at a time when it is critical for our Nation to increase trust in public health officials. Protection of these individual rights is also vital for encouraging — where and when medically appropriate — vaccination and/or other scientific measures for keeping Americans safe and healthy.

“This Act further protects Americans’ constitutional medical rights by holding federal, state, and local governments accountable for unnecessary, irrational, overreaching, and liberty-infringing COVID-19 vaccine mandates, when many other scientifically-proven, and less liberty-intrusive tools exist for mitigating the effects of and protecting against COVID-19,” the findings conclude.

""Under current law, Americans have few legal remedies to seek compensation for those that have been impacted by the coronavirus vaccine mandates.""\n   - The critical view of current laws limiting legal remedies and echoing the call for change suggests a right-leaning ideological stance. This often aligns with the conservative view of government overreach.\n  \n6. ""The legislation’s “Congressional Findings” declare that coronavirus vaccine mandates are “authoritarian” and lack a “scientific basis” for public health needs""\n   - Statements about government overreach and a lack of scientific basis reflect a common chorus within right-wing perspectives, where vaccine mandates are viewed as an infringement on personal freedoms.\n  \n7. ""This Act further protects Americans’ constitutional medical rights by holding federal, state, and local governments accountable...""\n   - By emphasizing the protection of constitutional medical rights, the piece reinforces classic right-wing ideology, prioritizing individual rights and liberty over collective health measures.\n\nOverall, the article displays a clear bias towards conservative or right-leaning ideologies, accorded through its emphasis on individual rights, opposition to mandatory vaccination, and promotion of conservative political actors and viewpoints.']",7.0,0.0,0.25
breitbart,Climate Change,"Former congressman and leading Republican gubernatorial candidate Lou Barletta (R-PA) told Breitbart News Saturday that as governor, he will use all powers available to him to stop illegal immigration, noting that many in the GOP do not have the backbone to stand against the radical left’s illegal immigration policies.

Recent polls show the Republican primary race as very much a two-man battle between himself and State Sen. Doug Mastriano. But with Democrat Gov. Tom Wolf (D) leaving office, Republicans have a clear chance to flip the governor’s mansion. Recent polls, Barletta said, are a “reflection on what we’re seeing on the ground,” as he has a “huge grassroots campaign.”

“People know who I am,” he said, noting that they can look at his record. Many remember the actions he took as the mayor of Hazleton, where he was essentially the first mayor to “stand up and fight against illegal immigration,” and he believes that is the kind of fighter they are looking for again.

“We see so many politicians making campaign promises, and they get in and become part of the problem and disappoint people,” Barletta said. “They want a fighter. They saw me on the national stage as a mayor of a small town and do something that nobody else in the country had the courage to do, and I really do believe that’s part of why we’re in front.”

As mayor, he prioritized fighting sanctuary city policies and the drugs pouring into his city.

“I didn’t talk about it. I actually did something about it,” he said, noting that he was elected in 2000 and watched as the town was “overcome by illegal immigrants.”

“Our population grew by 50 percent, but our tax revenue stayed the same,” he said, describing gangs moving in and recruiting children. Emergency times also increased as illegal aliens used emergency rooms as primary health care. Barletta, at the time, asked for help as violent crime went up.

“I couldn’t find an elected official anywhere in Pennsylvania,” he said, ultimately going to Washington, DC, and meeting with the Department of Justice in 2005. He “begged them for help” but realized “no one there was going to help, either.” Ultimately, Barletta took matters into his own hands and moved to suspend the license of “any business that knowingly hired an illegal alien because it is illegal to hire unlawful workers.” He added, “I would also suspend the license of any landlord who knowingly harbored or rented to illegal aliens.”

As a result, illegals represented by ACLU sued him, and he fought it to the Supreme Court. But many cities across the country followed what he did in Hazleton, and he battled for it in Congress as well.

“Unfortunately for us, I found out that even on our own side, people don’t like to talk about it, but they didn’t have the backbone or courage to do something about it, and look at the mess we have today,” he said, explaining that most politicians do not want to tackle issues regarding immigration because they will be called a racist or bigot. But he said as governor, he will have a lot more power to do something about the issue. Barletta added that he recently called out President Joe Biden, Gov. Tom Wolf (D), and State Attorney General Josh Shapiro over the “ghost flights” of illegals coming in the dead of the night, “dumping them all over Pennsylvania” without any knowledge.

He also noted that fentanyl deaths have hit a record high and “we know the fentanyl is coming from the southern border.” Yet Pennsylvania officials are continuing to allow Biden to dump illegal aliens in the Keystone State.

“That ends when I’m governor of Pennsylvania. I will go after anyone who aids — what I think is human trafficking here into Pennsylvania — dumping people without our knowledge into our communities,” he said. “I’ll go after the buses or anybody that helps relocate people who are illegally being brought into Pennsylvania.”

Barletta also said he will go after every sanctuary city “with every resource that [he has] in [his] power to protect the citizens of Pennsylvania.”

The former congressman also vowed to unleash energy in Pennsylvania as governor, noting that the Russian invasion of Ukraine “highlights Biden’s failure on our energy policy” — a major national security issue, he said.

“And Pennsylvania is the answer to that. We have more energy in Pennsylvania than countries around the world, in the Middle East. We can be a global leader, and we will be when I become governor,” Barletta said, vowing to drop the state out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

“We’re going to greenlight pipelines when I’m governor. We’re going to reform DEP [Department of Environmental Protection],” which, he said, they used as a weapon to stop natural gas companies.

“Pennsylvania is the answer to our national security issues, and when I’m governor, we’ll be a global leader again,” he promised.","[8, 7, 6, 8]","['The rhetoric and language in this article seem to suggest a strong alignment with right-wing ideology.

breitbart,Climate Change,"Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) on Thursday called on Congress to pass his legislation that would immediately restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands to combat rising energy prices and boost American energy independence.

“Congress must pass my bill, the SMART Energy Act, that requires President Biden to immediately restart oil and gas leasing on federal lands. We must support America’s energy independence, American energy jobs & American energy production. Especially during these times,” Daines said in a statement.

Daines’s Supporting Made in America Renewable and Traditional (SMART) Energy Act would require Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to hold four onshore oil and gas lease sales in the top seven oil and gas producing states as well as two offshore oil and gas lease sales in both the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska region. The top seven oil and gas producing states are Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Nevada. It would also support the expansion of wind, solar, and geothermal energy on public lands.

Daines’ renewed his push for the SMART Energy Act as Americans continued to grapple with rampant inflation, and energy prices continued to rise after Russia started its assault on Ukraine. Oil topped $100 for the first time in seven years.

Last year, Biden issued a ban on all new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands. Although a federal judge blocked the ban, the Biden administration has yet to hold an oil or gas lease sale in Montana.

breitbart,Economy,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) doubled down on Friday, warning that the state will not “subsidize” Disney’s “corporate speech” and vowed that the woke company “is not going to have its own government in Florida.”

Speaking at a press conference, where he announced the biggest tax relief package in the state’s history, DeSantis pointed to other wins the state has racked up, including “leading the effort in the country to make sure that our school system is for education, not for indoctrination.”

“That involves things like making sure every parent in Florida has the right to access the curriculum that’s being used in their kid’s school,” he said, explaining that the far-left has fought against his administration on that issue:

We want to make sure that we’re focusing on teaching kids to get the right answer and not being diverted by ideologies and other type of stuff that really isn’t pertinent in any of this. And then obviously we believe, you know, parents have the right to send their kids to like kindergarten without having a lot of this sexual content injected into the curriculum. And, you know, I think parents overwhelmingly agree with that.

“There’s one company that’s headquartered in Burbank, California that didn’t agree with that,” he said, referencing his administration’s war with Disney and making it clear that “we run this state, they do not run this state.”

“We’re going to do what’s right for parents,” he said, adding that it is “not the responsibility of Florida citizens to subsidize your corporate speech.”

As a result, the legislature took action to dissolve Disney’s special taxing district, sparking outcry from leftists.

“At the end of the day, Disney is not going to have its own government in Florida,” he vowed. “Disney is going to have to live under the same laws that everybody else lives under in Florida.”

“Disney will pay its fair share of taxes, and Disney is going to be responsible for all the debt it has racked up. That will happen. Anyone that tells you differently is not being honest about it,” he said, adding that they will outline the proposals in the “coming weeks and months.”

Disney has continued to pay the price, literally, for making it clear that it does not respect parental rights, as Walt Disney Co. lost nearly $63 billion in market capitalization since coming out against Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, which protects children in kindergarten through third grade from classroom discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity.","[7, 9, 5, 7]","['The rhetorical analysis of this article reveals a narrative that is supportive towards Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, portrays Disney negatively, and favors the protection of parental rights in education, which indicates a right-wing or conservative leaning.\n\n1.

breitbart,Economy,"Democrats in control of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee released six years of former President Donald Trump’s tax returns on Friday, an unprecedented intrusion that revealed nothing in particular.

The release marked the first time Congress had ever obtained and published the tax returns of any individual.

Trump had resisted calls to release his tax returns during the 2016 presidential election, saying that they were under audit. He was also reluctant to give political ammunition to his rivals. (In 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) claimed that Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had not paid taxes for years, a claim that was given credibility by the media but had no basis in fact.)

Democrats speculated that Trump must have been hiding something, and fantasized about what his returns might show. But when MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow published a 2005 tax return showing he paid $38 million in income taxes, she was widely mocked.

In 2019, the New York Times claimed to have obtained “decades” of Trump’s tax returns. Though the paper reported that he shown “chronic losses and years of tax avoidance,” it could find nothing illegal or untoward.

The Times story, if based on authentic documents, appears to debunk several conspiracy theories held by Democrats for years. The tax returns do not “any previously unreported connections to Russia,” the Times reports. Moreover, the Times story appears to confirm Trump’s claim — long treated as an excuse by Democrats — that he is under audit by the IRS. And the Times could not find “any itemized payments to Mr. Cohen,” ostensibly the subject of the New York investigation [into hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels].

Nevertheless, Democrats tried to use their majority on the Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, to force Trump to release his returns, though there was no real legislative purpose in doing so.

Trump resisted the committee’s efforts in the courts, until finally losing at the Supreme Court, which allowed the Committee to compel the IRS to turn over the tax returns of Trump, now a private citizen.

The House Ways and Means Committee released the returns just days before Democrats formally lose their majority in the House of Representatives — and, with it, majority control of the various House committees.

The six years of newly-released returns, covering the years 2015 through 2020, show that Trump paid a total of $4.4 million in federal income taxes over that period, with an adjusted gross income of -$53.2 million. “The Trumps paid some form of federal taxes every year, but they reported income-tax liability of $750 or less in three of the six years,” the Wall Street Journal noted. Democrats point to some potential problems. They claim that Trump’s tax returns as president were not properly audited by the IRS (a claim the IRS disputes). They also complained about charitable deductions and whether loans to his children should have been taxed as income.

However, there appeared to be few bombshells. In a statement on Truth Social, his social media platform, the former president said the returns showed “how proudly successful I have been” and warned that “the Democrats should never have done it.”

Republicans echoed the latter sentiment, saying the release of the tax returns seemed to have a purely political motive, and opened the door for Republicans to do the same in future.

breitbart,Election,"President Joe Biden exploited an alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) in October 2020, blaming President Donald Trump after sensational arrests in a crucial swing state — yet the trial ended Friday without any convictions.

Two of the accused, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta, were acquitted. The jury deadlocked on the charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft, the supposed leaders of the plot.

The Biden campaign and the establishment media treated all of the accused as if they were Trump supporters, yet Caserta was seen online in front of an anarchist flag, and Harris had joined a Black Lives Matter protest in June 2020 — both facts that were buried by the Democrat and the media in blaming Trump.

At the time the FBI announced the charges in October 2020, with the presidential campaign at a crucial point, Biden suggested that the defendants were white supremacists, and that Trump was at fault for the plot:

There is no place for hate in America. And both of us [including Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) have been talking about this for some time, about how white supremacists and these militias area a genuine threat. I want to compliment the FBI and the police agencies for what they did, and how they stepped up. But look –the words of a president matter. Whether they can — you’ve heard me say this before. They can cause a nation to have th market rise or fall, go to war or bring peace, but they can also breathe oxygen into those who are filled with hate and danger, and I just think It’s got to stop. The president has to realize the words he utters matter.

There was no evidence at the time tying Trump to the plot whatsoever, nor did any such evidence emerge during the trial.

As the trial continued, questions were raised about the role of the FBI informants, suggesting that they may have entrapped the defendants, or concocted the plot themselves. As Buzzfeed News — hardly a right-wing outlet — noted last year:

An examination of the case by BuzzFeed News also reveals that some of those informants, acting under the direction of the FBI, played a far larger role than has previously been reported. Working in secret, they did more than just passively observe and report on the actions of the suspects. Instead, they had a hand in nearly every aspect of the alleged plot, starting with its inception. The extent of their involvement raises questions as to whether there would have even been a conspiracy without them.

The judge issued jury instructions on entrapment, telling jurors they could find the defendants not guilty if they believed “[t]hat the agents or informants sought to persuade or pressure the men into agreeing to such a plot; and that the defendants showed no predisposition to commit such a crime until after the FBI came into the picture,” the Associated Press noted.

The FBI had shown a consistent hostility toward Trump both before and during his administration, with key FBI figures involved in pursuing the false “Russia collusion” conspiracy theory, even lying to a court to obtain a surveillance warrant.

The 45th president gave his stamp of approval — a much coveted prize among Republican hopefuls — to 33 candidates. Polling out of Texas has already shown that GOP voters are more likely to support candidates who have passed Trump’s muster.

The former president released a statement celebrating his late night victory:

Big night in Texas! All 33 candidates that were Trump endorsed have either won their primary election or are substantially leading in the case of a runoff. Governor Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick have won in a landslide. Thank you, and congratulations to all!

Trump’s endorsement secured the nomination of incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott (R), who faced fierce primary opposition from former State Sen. Don Huffines and former State Party Chairman Allen West. He also lifted two of House Republicans’ top recruits to the nomination without a runoff: Monica De La Cruz and Wesley Hunt, who are both at 56 percent with well over half the votes counted.

The Texas primaries are the first regularly scheduled primary elections in the 2022 cycle, making it the first opportunity to test the power of Trump’s endorsement post-presidency. As Breitbart News previously reported, how Trump fares on these races could influence how aggressive he gets in future primaries elsewhere in America.

The Canadian website The Province reported on the poll:

The idea that Canadian oil and gas could help fill shortfalls in Europe and the United States has received considerable traction in the weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, with some re-evaluating energy projects such as Keystone XL and Energy East. While 64 per cent of American believe Canada should fill the void left following the ban on Russian oil, the challenge for Canada would be in increasing production — it could take years, not weeks or months — and figuring out how to ship it across the border.

It also had a major partisan divide in 2017, with 76 percent of Republicans or Republican-leaning independents supporting it, and 74 percent of Democrats opposing it. That year, then-president Donald Trump reversed former president Barack Obama’s decision to halt the pipeline. In January 2021, Biden revoked the cross-border permits the pipeline needed, and the project was officially dead by June 2021.

Oz served in the Turkish military to maintain dual citizenship.

Although federal law does not prevent dual nationals from serving in Congress, pundits have raised concerns over Oz’s willingness to maintain dual citizenship.

“Oz’s dual citizenship – and his reluctance to renounce Turkish citizenship – will keep the FBI and security managers up at night,” said American Enterprise Institute’s Michael Rubin.

Council of Foreign Relations senior fellow Steve Cook had this to say:

Is he really an agent of the government? There’s not really any evidence of that. But if Oz has business connections that rely on being in the good graces of the government, there are legitimate questions about his views on these issues.

Oz spoke about his desire to maintain Turkish citizenship on the same day reports revealed he is in talks to return to television if his Senate candidacy is unsuccessful. “No one wants to admit defeat, but he isn’t a stupid man. He knows his campaign is on life support. Like any good doctor, he is already looking for alternatives to keep his career alive if he doesn’t win,” a source said.

With the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary scheduled for May 17, Oz has a lot of ground to make up if he wants to win the Republican nomination. A recent poll found Oz trailing Republican candidate David McCormick by nine points.","[5, 6, 7, 5]","['The article discusses how celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a U.S. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, would opt to maintain his dual citizenship with Turkey over obtaining certain security clearances.

breitbart,Police,"Former President Donald Trump will rally with supporters in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, the same evening President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama will team up for a final rally together ahead of the midterm elections on Tuesday.

Trump will campaign with Dr. Mehmet Oz, his hand-selected candidate for the Senate race while Obama and Biden will campaign with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the Democrat nominee struggling to recover from a stroke that occurred in May.

Biden believes his politics are strongest in Pennsylvania, as he has visited the state on multiple occasions to campaign for Democrat candidates and promote his economic agenda.

“This election is not a referendum. It’s a choice,” Biden told Pennsylvania Democrats at a party dinner last week. “A choice between two vastly different visions of America.”

Biden prided himself on winning Pennsylvania in the 2020 presidential election after Trump shocked the political world by winning the state and its 20 electoral votes in the 2016 election.

The president continues preaching his belief in taxing the wealthy more and giving the working and middle classes more government benefits, as he says, so they can “just have a little bit of breathing room.”

But as Democrats face tough political headwinds, Biden is reaching out to his old boss for assistance in motivating Democrats to get back to the polls.

The Obama and Biden rally in Philadelphia is where Democrats are making their last stand, hoping that Biden’s first two years as president will inspire Democrats to stand with him despite concerns about crime, inflation, and high gas prices.

But Trump is eager for a rematch, viewing Biden as a weak political force that will collapse in the face of eager Republicans, and some independents who are ready for a change.

Trump is campaigning outside of Pittsburgh, where his political message continues to resonate as rural supporters in the state fly their Trump flags and more aggressive flags denouncing Biden.

As president, Trump famously vowed to represent “Pittsburgh, not Paris” and continues to campaign on making America great again by getting tough on crime, boosting the production of American energy, and lowering inflation.

The showdown in Pennsylvania will signal where the state and the country are going as both Trump and Biden are eyeing their presidential campaigns in 2024.","[10, 6, 6, 6]","['The overall tone and language choice of the article are neutral and factual, providing an unbiased view of the different political stances held by Biden and Trump, without taking sides or promoting one over the other.\n\n1.

breitbart,Police,"President Joe Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that “there were no identifiable victims” in a case where she reduced the prison sentence of a self-proclaimed drug “kingpin.”

During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jackson was asked about the case of convicted drug trafficker Keith Young whom, in 2018, she sentenced to 20 years in prison, but later reduced the sentence.

Young trafficked heroin laced with fentanyl, the deadly drug just one kilogram of which can kill half a million people. There are a million milligrams in one kilogram.

When asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) if she had contacted the victims before reducing Young’s sentence, Jackson suggested that “there were no identifiable victims.”

The exchange went as follows:

COTTON: Judge Jackson, before you granted this fentanyl kingpin’s motion to reduce his sentence, did you contact any of the victims in his case? JACKSON: Senator, thank you for allowing me to address Mr. Young’s situation. COTTON: I asked a simple question, did you contact the victims in his case or not? JACKSON: Senator, Mr. Young was not released. His sentence was reduced and I did not contact the victims in this case because there were no victims. He committed a crime, a drug crime. There were no identifiable victims in his case. COTTON: Drug crimes are not victimless crimes — 100,000 Americans are killed by overdoses. JACKSON: Understood Senator, but there was no one to contact because there were no identifiable…

As Cotton noted, Jackson initially apologized to Young for having to sentence him to 20 years in prison. Following passage of the First Step Act and amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Young requested compassionate release from federal prison.

Though Jackson denied the request, she rewarded him with a reduced sentence that cut his time in prison by at least seven years. Young bragged about his role as a drug “kingpin” and was authorizing payments for drugs while in prison before Jackson cut his sentence.

“You reduced his sentence. He didn’t file a motion to reduce his sentence. He wasn’t eligible for a reduced sentence under the First Step Act because it wasn’t retroactive toward him,” Cotton said.

“You took a motion for compassionate release, to get out of prison, and turned it into a motion to reduce a sentence so he is going to be released seven and a half years earlier, years from now,” he continued.

Across the United States, drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in recent years. From April 2020 to April 2021, for example, more than 100,000 Americans died from overdoses. Deaths from overdoses now outpace the number of Americans killed from car crashes and guns, combined.

""President Joe Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that “there were no identifiable victims” in a case where she reduced the prison sentence of a self-proclaimed drug “kingpin.”"" \n    - Initial framing describes Judge Jackson as President Biden\'s nominee, and calls attention to a seemingly controversial decision she made.

""Young trafficked heroin laced with fentanyl, the deadly drug just one kilogram of which can kill half a million people.

""John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.""\n   - Breitbart News is renowned for its conservative perspective, suggesting the underlying ideology of the article.\n\nOverall, the article\'s framing of the nominee\'s actions and the issues raised reveals a critique consistent with right-wing perspectives that prioritize stringent law enforcement and the potential societal threats posed by lenient sentences for severe drug-related crimes.', 'The language and reporting style of this article reflect a right-leaning or conservative ideological perspective. The article takes a clear stance against the President\'s nominee for the Supreme Court, suggesting view points typically associated with a right-wing or conservative ideology.\n\n1. ""President Joe Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that “there were no identifiable victims” in a case where she reduced the prison sentence of a self-proclaimed drug “kingpin.”""\n    - The article opens with a clear critique of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, indicating a conservative bias against her. The implication is that she made an error in judgement, which could result in negative consequences, and therefore might not be fit for the Supreme Court.\n\n2. ""Young trafficked heroin laced with fentanyl, the deadly drug just one kilogram of which can kill half a million people. There are a million milligrams in one kilogram.""\n    - This detailed description of the drugs involved in the case and their potential harm serves the purpose of sensationalizing the crime and intensifying criticisms towards Judge Jackson\'s decision, which aligns with typical conservative approaches that emphasize tougher sentences on drug-related crimes.\n\n3. ""As Cotton noted, Jackson initially apologized to Young for having to sentence him to 20 years in prison. Following passage of the First Step Act and amid the Chinese coronavirus crisis, Young requested compassionate release from federal prison.""\n    - The addition of Sen. Cotton\'s criticism further supports the right-leaning slant. By noting Jackson\'s apparently lenient attitude towards sentencing and the reduction of Young\'s sentence amid the coronavirus crisis, the article seems to imply disagreement with compassionate release or sentence reduction that can be associated with more liberal judicial reforms.\n\n4. ""Across the United States, drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in recent years. From April 2020 to April 2021, for example, more than 100,000 Americans died from overdoses. Deaths from overdoses now outpace the number of Americans killed from car crashes and guns, combined.""\n    - The use of these statistics suggests concern about drug-related crime and deaths, a topic often associated with the right-wing stance of prioritizing law and order.\n\n5. ""“You reduced his sentence. He didn’t file a motion to reduce his sentence. He wasn’t eligible for a reduced sentence under the First Step Act because it wasn’t retroactive toward him,” Cotton said.""\n    - The use of Sen. Cotton\'s quote criticizing Judge Jackson implies support for his viewpoint, indicating a bias against the judicial actions taken by Jackson, and a concern that her decisions might endanger public safety, again signifying a right-leaning perspective.\n\nIn summary, the overall ideological perspective in this article is distinctly right-leaning. The criticisms of Judge Jackson\'s professional decisions, the emphasis on the potential harms from drug-related crimes, and support for the criticism from a Republican senator, all suggest a conservative viewpoint.', 'The article presents a clear critique of President Joe Biden\'s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, focusing on a specific case she handled. The overall tone suggests a right-wing or conservative perspective with the emphasis on crime and drug issues.\n\n1. ""President Joe Biden’s nominee to replace Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, suggested that “there were no identifiable victims” in a case where she reduced the prison sentence of a self-proclaimed drug “kingpin.”""\n   - The article begins with a negative portrayal of Judge Jackson, implying she was lenient toward a serious criminal, expressing an ideological stance often associated with conservatives, favoring strict crime punishment.\n\n2. ""Young trafficked heroin laced with fentanyl, the deadly drug just one kilogram of which can kill half a million people.""\n   - The detailing of the severity of Young\'s crime and emphasis on the lethality of the drugs he trafficked shows the author\'s focus on the magnitude of crimes related to drugs. This aligns with a conservative ideology that tends to take a hardline stance on drug-related offenses.\n\n3. ""When asked by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) if she had contacted the victims before reducing Young’s sentence, Jackson suggested that “there were no identifiable victims.”""\n   - By mentioning Senator Cotton\'s question on victims and quoting Jackson\'s response, the article attempts to paint her as dismissive of the potential harm caused by the criminal, mirroring a conservative perspective that prioritizes victims\' interests in criminal justice matters.\n\n4. ""As Cotton noted, Jackson initially apologized to Young for having to sentence him to 20 years in prison.""\n   - Highlighting that Jackson apologized to the criminal presents her as sympathetic to the offender over the potential victims of his drug trafficking, implying a perspective critical of leniency in punishment strategies, consistent with a conservative ideology.\n\n5. ""Though Jackson denied the request, she rewarded him with a reduced sentence that cut his time in prison by at least seven years.""\n   - The author\'s use of ""rewarded"" frames the reduction of the sentence as an unnecessary gift, reflecting a stance that views reduced sentences negatively, typically found in conservative ideologies.\n\n6. ""Across the United States, drug overdose deaths have skyrocketed in recent years.""\n   - The article concludes by highlighting the severity of the drug overdose problem in the United States, positioning it as a pressing issue that should influence decisions in the justice system. This aligns with a conservative perspective that emphasizes the need for stringent measures to handle drug-related issues.\n\nIn summary, the article critiques Judge Jackson\'s handling of a specific case through a lens aligned with right-wing or conservative ideology, emphasizing the perceived leniency towards a convicted drug trafficker and framing this within the context of broader issues of crime and drug fatalities.']",6.0,0.816496580927726,0.75
dailykos,Abortion,"I was out of the country in May when news of the SCOTUS leak in which Justice Samuel Alito’s policy statement went viral. I hadn’t watched TV for a week and barely signed onto social media but when I did, I read astute and deeply troubling reactions to the document designed to overturn Roe v. Wade, which has been considered established law for 50 years.

The document Justice Alito wrote was supported by four of his Court colleagues, revealing unsurprisingly that a majority of the Court concurred with ending women’s right to abortion. The timing of the leak was significant; it occurred when the Court was scheduled to rule on the constitutionality of a Mississippi abortion law which prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.

If the Court finds that the Mississippi law stands, it will have sanctioned ending Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own laws regarding abortion. Some states have already established Draconian laws that include charging women with murder if they miscarry or have an abortion. Some have ruled that physicians who perform abortions can be charged with a felony crime and some have set up vigilante laws that could affect anyone who helps a woman get an abortion.

Essentially the demise of the constitutional right to abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy will end women’s right to abortion in over half the states in this country. The implications are huge, not only for American women but for the future of the country, and they are abundantly clear.

Many analysts and pundits have written cogently and urgently about the legal, physical, economic and emotional consequences for women and others in this country, and for all of us with respect to our civil and human rights. As a women’s health educator and advocate I am all too familiar with those consequences. I have heard women’s testimonials, read their memoirs, listened to their stories. I have helped them access abortion care and as a doula I have helped them give birth to much wanted babies.

After the Alito document was revealed (and during the last confirmation hearings) I thought about the great legal minds of the past who had served on the Supreme Court, Justices like Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg among them. Now I mourn what has become of that institution, where several judges lied under oath to Congress regarding precedent, and where many are willing to ignore the Constitution’s 4th amendment right of Americans to be “secure in their persons” and to “not be violated or subjected to “unreasonable searches and seizures.”

It pains and frightens me that faulty - some might say puerile logic - superficial, antiquated, cliched justifications, overt sexism, and religious ideology are blatantly on display. (It is worth noting that seven of the current justices are Catholic and no Protestants are on the bench).

Couple that with the less than stellar records and legal experience of several justices, the alleged sexual harassment conduct of two justices, the conflict of interest on the part of a justice whose wife actively supported the insurrection, along with the majority’s willing abrogation of civil and human rights and one can question where “liberty and justice for all” has gone.

How, I ask myself in these traumatic judgment days, has this largely trusted American institution so quickly deteriorated into depravity? How did its majority come to rely on bumper sticker taglines, social media tropes, and arguments so weak and sloppy that they wouldn’t pass muster in a law school? Where has compassionate consideration in difficult matters gone? Why have context, untoward consequences, and the reality of people’s lives disappeared?

The fact is the Supreme Court has become a political organization with its own dark agenda and its reputation will forever be tarnished, all because four men and one woman who should know better, appointed by a far right, self-serving autocrat, are now seated for life on the highest court in the land, along with several hundred inappropriate federal judges.

The price we’ll all pay for judicial travesties, individually and together, grows ever clearer and more threatening. If Roe v. Wade is overturned women’s lives will be destroyed. Precedent in other matters (gay and interracial marriage, LGBTG rights and more) will no longer be valid, and revision of laws that wreak havoc because of ignorance and a taste for punishment will return.

It is no stretch to say that we will become an even more divided and dangerous nation, two-tiered and binary in ways that we can’t yet imagine. Violence is likely to flourish along with racism, anti-Semitism, sexism and increased marginalization. The elderly, young, disabled, and ill will suffer even more profoundly. Murder charges, incarcerations and suicides will become commonplace. Poverty will prevail for those in the 99 percent, while corporations and billionaires flourish. Family structures will be deeply and sadly impacted. The earth will be at risk sooner than predicted.

This is not solely about women’s rights, and it is not hyperbole. It’s a harbinger of what is to come because of laws we must live with, who makes and enforces those laws, who adjudicates disputes, what national priorities are established and by whom. It is about the future, which now is in the hands of the Supreme Court – a court plunged into decline that endangers us all.

It’s a court that is beyond disappointing, a court with extraordinary power to shape our lives, and it grows ever more dangerous.","[6, 7, 8, 8]","['The language and reporting style of this article strongly reflect a left-leaning or liberal ideological perspective.

dailykos,Abortion,"First, I love Joe Biden. I haven’t changed my opinion of him since day 1. Second, I’m a progressive, but I’m a pragmatist. Biden is not a moderate on the full political spectrum, he’s definitely a Dem. Within the Democratic party, he’s right about in the middle. He wants some (maybe all) student debt forgiveness; he wants some no-cost college options; he is definitely pro women’s rights and pro democracy. He knows he can’t get everything he wants, or the rest of us, but he is willing to fight for some.

He is not a neocon. He got our nation out of its longest war. He has supported the people of Ukraine, way before it was popular. He believes in science, and also his faith. Lots of things I love about Joe. Uninformed people too often blame the president for the inactions of certain senators or congress members, or to anti-democratic filibuster rules, which result in the administration’s goals not being accomplished.

Unless the reproductive rights issue is resolved (somehow) this year, either by eliminating the filibuster or by judicial changes of mind/changes of number (on SCOTUS) … the 2024 presidential/senate/congressional elections will be the biggest fight ever for the individual rights of not only women, but also others that the conservatives have long dreamed of marginalizing.

“Oh, the GOP would never get away with rescinding marriage equality,” some might say. “Too many Americans are fine with it and even supportive.” — Well, 60% or more of Americans think that abortion and contraceptive rights should be legal, even though some of that number may not personally like the thought. And according to the CDC (www.cdc.gov/...), about 65% of women aged 15-49 use contraception. (So, 65% of half of females in the USA, who are about 51% of all Americans.

And only 33% of the Supreme Court is female, none of whom are in that age range.) Wanna gamble on the outcome if they were to rule on it?

If we still need to protect and enshrine, personal, biological and reproductive rights in 2024, I think we must have a female candidate for president. Who? I am not sure. I like Kamala a lot, and she is obviously the best-positioned to mount a campaign, but I am not sold on her ability to connect more widely. And many of the most powerful female politicians that have a national audience, are more senior in age and that might hinder them.

Aside from Kamala, Warren, and Clinton, who do you see as the most viable female presidential candidate if it is necessary — and Joe Biden supports it- to change presidential candidates in 2024? (Let me state again that I am not not not anti-Joe Biden).

dailykos,COVID,"In a recent issue of Grasping Reality Newsletter Brad DeLong appears to dismiss current fears by economists across the ideological spectrum and echoed by the mainstream press of runaway inflation in the US economy. He seems to believe the current jump in perceived inflation is simply the economy catching up after the COVID slowdown exacerbated by the lagging gear up of the supply chain

But so far, rising inflation has not been incorporated into any of the “sticky” prices in the economy, according to the measure constructed by the Atlanta Federal Reserve. True, the financial market’s current 30-year breakeven inflation rate, at 2.35%, is more than half a percentage point above where it settled in the second half of the 2010s. But today’s rate is similar to that in the first half of the decade, and slightly below the level that would be consistent with the US Federal Reserve’s inflation target of 2% per year. The current uptick in US inflation is highly likely to be simply rubber on the road, resulting from the post-pandemic recovery. There is no sign that inflation expectations have become de-anchored. The labor market is still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in real wages. Financial markets are blasé about the possibility of rising inflation. And a substantial fiscal contraction is already in train. Given these facts, why would anybody argue that the “original sin” was the “oversized American Rescue Plan,” and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate it? I, for one, simply cannot follow their logic.

Ryan Avent: Inflation: ‘The carping about inflation really irks me, because I’m not so certain that there is. As noted before, consumer prices are up 6.2% over the past 12 months. It is also the case that real GDP (adjusted for inflation) is up 5% over the past 12 months, and employment is up by about 5.8m jobs. The American economy, notably, has surpassed its pre-pandemic level of economic output while other rich economies, like the euro area, have not. Even so, consumer prices in the euro area have risen by more than 4% over the past year, which is a lot, especially if you’re a German. Had there been less American stimulus, there would have been less inflation, but there would also have been less growth in output and employment. It is possible that less stimulus might have meant a lot less inflation and only a little less of the other stuff. But on the other hand, unemployment is much costlier than inflation, so you really would need quite a lot less inflation for not much less employment growth to break even, so to speak, relative to the reality in which we find ourselves…

While I tend to agree with them regarding the actual state of the economy, I am distressed with their implied recommendation to “leave it alone” and hope that “it will all work out.” Economics and Politics are separate only in the minds of academics. The appearance of doing something, of moving quickly and forcefully to address the perceived crisis even if it is a fantasy is necessary to allow things to work out or most certainly those seeking to profit from the perceived crisis will move the firmament to assure it does not do so on your watch. It is not enough to call a meeting of poobahs or issue press releases that things are or will work out. A distinct specific executive action should be taken immediately claiming it will mitigate or end end the crisis so that when the expected slowing of the perceived inflation bubble occurs it will appear as though it was due to the timely and perceptive action by the chief-executive.","[6, 6, 5, 7]","['The language and reporting style of this article demonstrate a left-leaning or liberal ideological perspective.

""He seems to believe the current jump in perceived inflation is simply the economy catching up after the COVID slowdown exacerbated by the lagging gear up of the supply chain.""\n   - This quote frames the current inflation as a temporary issue resulting from COVID, and not a sign of inherent economic problems, a view typically supported by more left-leaning economists.\n\n3. ""The current uptick in US inflation is highly likely to be simply rubber on the road, resulting from the post-pandemic recovery.""\n   - The metaphor of the inflation uptick being ""rubber on the road"" suggests the author supports a perspective that inflation is a temporary, manageable issue, which aligns with a left-leaning viewpoint.\n\n4. ""Given these facts, why would anybody argue that the “original sin” was the “oversized American Rescue Plan,” and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate it?

The language and framing of the issues addressed suggest a left-leaning economic perspective, largely aligning with Keynesian economics which stress the importance of managing demand-side factors through active government intervention.\n\n1. ""He seems to believe the current jump in perceived inflation is simply the economy catching up after the COVID slowdown exacerbated by the lagging gear up of the supply chain.""\n   - This statement suggests the view that the observed inflation is a natural economic adjustment following a period of crises, rather than an indicator of economic mismanagement or systemic problem. This perspective, which could suggest faith in the inherent ability of the economy to self-correct given sufficient time and stability, typically aligns with Keynesian economic approaches associated with the left.\n\n2.

""The labor market is still weak enough that workers are unable to demand substantial increases in real wages. Financial markets are blasé about the possibility of rising inflation.""\n   - The lack of substantial wage growth is perceived by the author as a sign of the weak labor market. This focus on worker wages and the labor market suggests an alignment with left-leaning economic ideologies which tend to prioritize wage growth and labor market conditions.\n\n4. ""And a substantial fiscal contraction is already in train.""\n   - The author\'s mention of ""fiscal contraction"" is referring to the reduction in government expenditure to manage the economy. This concern for government\'s budgetary policies and their impact on the economy is central to Keynesian economics.\n\n5. ""Given these facts, why would anybody argue that the “original sin” was the “oversized American Rescue Plan,” and that tightening monetary policy starting right now is the proper way to expiate it?""\n   - This rhetorical question suggests skepticism regarding the criticism of the American Rescue Plan and the imperative of tightening monetary policy. This defense of government spending in the face of economic difficulties and questioning the orthodox monetary policy approach tie in with a more left-leaning ideology, specifically the Keynesian school of thought.\n\n6. ""While I tend to agree with them regarding the actual state of the economy, I am distressed with their implied recommendation to “leave it alone” and hope that “it will all work out.”\n   - The critique here of a hands-off approach to the economy indicates preference for state intervention, a characteristic feature of left-wing or Keynesian economic perspectives.\n\nIn summary, while the article does delves into the debate over inflation currently underway among economists and policy makers, the language and argumentation indicate a left-leaning or Keynesian perspective on the nature of inflation, the role of government policy in weathering economic crises, and the criticism of laissez-faire economists.', 'The analysis of this article suggests a slightly left-wing or liberal-leaning ideological perspective. The article criticizes the narrative of an impending inflation crisis, arguing it\'s a result of a post-pandemic recovery rather than a fundamental issue, a view more aligned with left-wing economic views. \n\n1. ""In a recent issue of Grasping Reality Newsletter Brad DeLong appears to dismiss current fears by economists across the ideological spectrum and echoed by the mainstream press of runaway inflation in the US economy.""\n   - The dismissal of inflation fears, a concern emphasized more by right-leaning economists and media, suggests a perspective that aligns with left-wing ideologies that prioritize economic stimulus and recovery.\n\n2. ""The current uptick in US inflation is highly likely to be simply rubber on the road, resulting from the post-pandemic recovery.

dailykos,COVID,"Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) has been running a heavy flight of campaign ads across state TV channels in the past week or so, blaming Democrats and President Biden for high gas prices, deficit spending, and inflation. Even though It's all way too pat and simplistic, I imagine those lies will work on some GOP base voters. Still, they are lies. Even Politifact Wisconsin sees that, so far focusing only on the senator's gasoline-price claims. But trust me, the rest of RoJo's ad is equally misleading. After all:

In four years Trumpublicans including Johnson ran up the national debt by nearly eight thousand billion dollars (for the zero-challenged that's $8,000,000,000,000). Meanwhile that little inconvenience called the COVID pandemic -- which has killed ONE MILLION Americans officially and unofficially up to six times that many -- triggered a giant recession all by itself. Clearly Biden's fault -- not. But Johnson's and Trump's slow and disbelieving reactions surely made the pandemic worse.

And now the Russia-Ukraine war is further ramping up the worldwide supply-chain problem and putting further pressure on prices. But the senator wears blinders to all that and expects you to don a horse halter along with him. Expect to bite hard into the metal bit when The Previous Guy and his minions pull back your reins some more, but don't blame Democratic lawmakers for steering you their way.

Maybe if GOP politicians including Johnson and Trump hadn't praised and coddled Vladimir Putin (and in Johnson's case shown up with other Republican congressmen on Putin's virtual doorstep in Moscow during one American Independence Day), we wouldn't have to deal with that last crisis, which Johnson like other Republicans would like to pin on Biden. Ridiculous. Nevertheless, thanks to the way campaigns and campaign spending now work, ,it will be hard though not impossible to kick this empty suit out of the Senate in November.

dailykos,Climate Change,"About an hour ago, the SEC approved a rules proposal to require any SEC publicly registered company to report their carbon emissions in their financial reports. This will open any number of interesting challenges to firms (assuming it survives court challenges — which is a significant risk).

The major requirements are listed by NPR here:

1. They must disclose risks to operations from climate risk — flooding from rising water for waterfront operations, probably insurance claims costs for insurers, etc.

2. They will need to report Scope 1 emissions — emissions from their own operations — and Scope 2 emissions — indirect emissions from generation of purchased energy

The inclusion of Scope 3 emissions — all other emissions not in Scope 1 and 2 — will be required to be reported if “material”.

Here is the nuance — incorrect reporting of information in your financial report is actionable by shareholders. Even more importantly, failing to report “material” information because you determined it to be “immaterial” is also actionable. If a company such as a major retailer were to not disclose any of its Scope 3 because it was ‘immaterial” would just be asking for a lawsuit — because all the emissions from the cargo ships would be Scope 3 emissions for that firm, as well as all the trucks, etc.

This is positioned to force companies to disclose. It is also likely to force them to disclose where they are using offsets — which also makes the offsets being used subject to scrutiny.

This may be of real value (or it could get completely watered down and washed away). It is something people should focus on and get ready to write comment letters to the SEC.","[5, 6, 6, 6]","['The language and reporting style of the article reflect a neutral to left-leaning ideological perspective.

""About an hour ago, the SEC approved a rules proposal to require any SEC publicly registered company to report their carbon emissions in their financial reports.""\n   - The framing of the new SEC proposal as relevant and worthy of reporting indicates a left-leaning view that emphasizes environmental accountability and transparency, widely supported by liberals who advocate rigorous climate regulations.\n\n2.

""The inclusion of Scope 3 emissions — all other emissions not in Scope 1 and 2 — will be required to be reported if “material”.\n   - Requirement for firms to report Scope 3 emissions, which are typically harder to quantify and overlooked due to their indirect nature, reflects a thorough and comprehensive approach to environmental accountability.

dailykos,Economy,"The latest inflation report says that prices rose 7.5 percent over the past year, the highest inflation rate in 30 years. And according to the corporate media, it's all because of Joe Biden and government spending. In fact, one of the biggest drivers of inflation is something the mainstream media never talks about at all: the outsized power of corporations. Just two companies, Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, dominate the market for household paper products like diapers and toilet paper. Four large meat-processing conglomerates control the prices of beef, pork, and poultry. And don't get me started on Amazon and Walmart. These companies aren't raising prices because they have to. They're raising prices because they can. But the American people aren't hearing any of this, and that's a big, big problem. Because if the voters don't get the real story about monopolistic power and what's causing inflation, they won't know what solutions to demand from their elected officials. Worse yet, they just might end up rewarding the very corporations responsible for the problem by electing a Republican majority in Congress—whose corporate campaign donations ensure they won't break up corporate monopoly power. If markets were truly competitive, companies would need to keep their prices down in order to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. But greedy corporations are raising prices even as they rake in record profits. How can this be? The answer is that they have so much market power they can artificially drive up prices with impunity. Again: The lion's share of the market for toilet paper is controlled by just two companies: P&G and Kimberly-Clark. So last April, when they jacked up prices, we had no choice but to pay up. Or consider another consumer product duopoly—PepsiCo (the parent company of Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, Tropicana, and other brands), and Coca-Cola. In April, PepsiCo announced it was increasing prices. Then, just like clockwork, its only major competitor announced similar price hikes. In every case, the companies blamed higher costs on labor, freight, and raw materials. But in every case, these companies were also recording record profits, and their CEOs were raking it in. In other words, they're lying to you. They're using ""inflation"" as an excuse to price gouge and fatten compensation packages for their executives. Here's the thing.

dailykos,Economy,"CNN and other outlets are reporting that former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud case against him because the prosecutors are “politically motivated” and are out to get him and Trump. Weisselberg also argues that the city and state of New York have no jurisdiction over federal income tax matters. And the icing on the cake is that Weisselberg was granted immunity for his grand jury testimony against Michael Cohen, so prosecutors cannot use anything he said in his grand jury testimony.

Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has asked a judge to dismiss the tax fraud indictment against him, saying it violates the immunity he was given in the federal investigation into Michael Cohen, a former personal attorney to former President Donald Trump, and that certain charges fall outside of the statute of limitations. Weisselberg’s attorneys also argued in the 162-page brief that the Manhattan district attorney and New York attorney general have targeted Trump, Weisselberg and the Trump Organization. In the filing, his attorneys argue that New York authorities were politically motivated in pursuing the indictment last summer charging them with a 15-year tax fraud scheme. Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty. The motion to dismiss comes as the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office continues to investigate the Trump Organization and its executives about the accuracy of financial statements provided to lenders, insurers and others. Last week, a New York judge ruled that Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and daughter Ivanka Trump need to testify in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into the Trump Organization’s finances. Trumps attorneys have vowed to appeal. In arguing for the dismissal, Weisselberg’s lawyers write, “Mr. Weisselberg’s federal grand jury testimony forged the first link in the chain of evidence that culminated in this Indictment.” The lawyers argued that Cohen had embarked on a campaign driven by “vengeance” against Weisselberg and cooperated extensively with the district attorney’s office, suggesting the internal nickname for the investigation is “fixer,” a nod to Cohen’s self-proclaimed title.

First up, I’d like to know what judge is considering Weisselberg’s petition to have all charges dismissed. I assume it is a judge from New York, considering The Trump Organization is getting hit from both the Manhattan DA and the New York State Attorney General Tish James. And this sounds like a typical legal stalling tactic from Trump, and Weisselberg is Trump’s Sith apprentice.

But I had wondered what was going through Weisselberg’s head when it came to the charges arrayed against him. Remember when people thought that Weisselberg would flip? I even thought he would. He’s an old guy, and why should he go to prison for Trump?

However, Weisselberg is determined to tough this out. I’m just guessing here, but I think that Weisselberg has picked up a bunch of tricks from Donald Trump over his decades of service to the Dark Lord. Weisselberg has witnessed Trump evade legal jams from the beginning of time, so why couldn’t Weisselberg do the same?

And this petition has all the gall of a Trump acolyte.
• Throw all kinds of “legal” arguments at the wall to see which one sticks.
• Emphasize “You cannot touch be because of matter X!”
• And be dishonest during the entire process.

Here is where that last point comes in:

CNN previously reported that federal prosecutors suspected Weisselberg was not entirely truthful during his grand jury testimony and considered charging him with perjury. Weisselberg was granted partial immunity for his testimony about hush money paid to Stormy Daniels. Cohen pleaded guilty to nine federal crimes, including campaign finance charges… Weisselberg’s attorneys also asked the judge to suppress statements Weisselberg had made while he was in custody for eight hours the morning he surrendered to face the charges. While in custody, Weisselberg made statements about living in Manhattan and the high cost of schooling – issues at the heart of the indictment. His attorneys say those statements were compelled in violation of his constitutional rights.

I don’t know how much evidence the prosecutors have on Weisselberg, but unless he finds a really corrupt judge, I think his petition for dismissal will be rejected. There is a paper trial from what I have read. But no matter, the point is to stall and throw as much sand as possible into the slow wheels of the justice system.

As to why Weisselberg has resurfaced now, this may have something to do with it:

This is a “limited deposition,” but the Trump lawyers were having a hissy fit that the judge is compelling Weisselberg to cough up any knowledge he has about the Trump Inauguration Committee. This tends to get forgotten, but the DC Attorney General is pursuing a lawsuit against the Trump Inauguration Committee for ripping people off.

Anyway, I expect Weisselberg will lie or plead the Fifth during this deposition.

dailykos,Election,"Well, it’s football season, so we’ll go there metaphorically. Half time (the mid-terms) for the Biden Administration is nearly here. It’s time to look at the stats for team blue.

Now Regular Joe (as opposed to Broad Way Joe) has been at this game since 1970 when he was elected to the New Castle County Council. At age 29 he was elected to the United States Senate. One of the youngest ever elected to the most exclusive club on this planet. Served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a dozen years; then the Judiciary Committee from 1987 till 1995. He ran to quarter back the Executive Branch twice… in 1987 and again in 1995. Failed both times. Then in 2007 he chose to run with one Barack Obama. As his backup. He was at this moment the fourth senior sitting senator. He gave that up to switch leagues from the legislative branch to the executive branch: if you please. As the back up! There is an old saw that goes something like this, “There once were two brothers: one became a missionary who went to deepest darkest Africa and the other became Vice President and neither were heard from again!” Not so here!

They ran: they won. Twice. The bromance began then, still exists and is stronger today. For eight years Joe served as the backup. The bomb, their major score, was the passage of The Affordable Care Act, aka Obama Care. It passed the senate 60-39. Just enough for passage. Thank you, darlin’ Arlen Specter, (D? Pa.) Never had a single bullet gone so far! Oh yeah, they saved the auto industry too. No trick play that.

And Joe stepped off the field. The personal pain and grief of losing a son to brain cancer was consuming...debilitating. After a season off the field, he decided to run again for quarter back of the Executive Branch. After a slow start in the primaries, he won going away, as they say. The ‘W’ in the Presidential Election was most respectable and gratifying.

At the start of the first half of our current game Regular Joe quarter backed using the bipartisan play book. The fans howled. Team red doesn’t play by those rules they said. And they were right. But using a play book and knowing the rules of the game are two very different things. Joe knows the rule book front to back. He called the 50 plus one rule for budget plays in the senate for his American Rescue Plan and Kamala ran it in. (First woman backup QB...a woman of color to boot... more points for the blue team) The 1.9 trillion $ bill was signed on 3/11/21. Major score!

Infrastructure Week. That was a punch line during the previous four-year game. Joe’s Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Bill passed the senate 69/30. Guess the red team likes bridges that aren’t ready to fall down or already have and roads that don’t rattle your fillings. And the fans grumbled that yeah that one was bipartisan. So what!

The next major score was the Chip and Science Act. Ain’t talking potato chips here fans. And, stunningly, this was passed in the senate 64-33. A bipartisan vote. Not the wonder of the age...just a contender. Signed into law 8/9/22...I believe.

Now for the IRA. No, not your retirement plan fan. The Inflation Reduction Act is what I’m talking’bout. Joe again called the 50 plus rule in the senate. And again, Kamala ran it in. Passed 51/50. In a hundred-member body. Check the rule book. Csonka got nothin’ on Kamala. The best part of this play, besides the passage of the bill, is the fact that the red team's senate middle linebacker aka Senate Minority leader Mitch Mcconnell, got blind-sided on the play. The old turtle found himself sitttin’ on a fence post with his legs waving in the air and he knows exactly who put him there. Just the look on his face….

So, half time is approaching, and team blue has run up the score pretty good. Joe gets ready for the second half with an inspirational speech to his team and fans in front of the building in Philly where the founders of this game wrote down the rules, aka The Constitution of the United Staes of America. Some in the stands complained about the red background. If you think that was an unforced error, you don’t know Joe. Isn’t red a sign of danger? The two Marines were a nice touch too A reminder, they protect The President of the United States. And their standing post added a just right aggressive touch, ordered by the Commander in Chief.

Joe told us about the new play book he would use in the second half. The bipartisan playbook put aside for the moment. Using it he got what he could from team red (a lot). When he could get nothing more, he changed the play book and... Mitch meets fence post. Divide and conquer the red team. Why yes, there are good people on the red team. Maybe most of the team. Bipartisan votes prove that. But some members of the red team are semi! A danger to the greatest game ever invented. Their fans are upset. Good. Emotional and upset people make mistakes. Make bad calls.

I don’t know how the second half will play out but we gonna find out. Well Regular Joe isn’t the goat but he will make the hall of fame next to such greats as the FDR/ Truman team. They played for 20 years and changed the world. LBJ comes to mind, if only for his domestic game. You look at Joe and what do you see? Nearing 80 there ain’t much left physically. Just bone, muscle and sinew. But, after a lifetime of studying and learning and playing the greatest game ever, this is his sublime moment!","[7, 5, 9, 7]","['This article uses a mixture of metaphors, facts, and commentary to present a perspective that seems aligned with the Democratic party or the left-wing ideology. \n\n1.

dailykos,Election,"It is illogical that anyone could feel that saving the Filibuster is more important than saving our right to vote, our democracy & the constitution. That is why I have a couple questions for you both. First: You do know that Majority leader, McConnell stole the SCOTUS seat from President Obama & Democrats in 2016, after which he ditched the Filibuster in 2017 so Republicans could approve Neal Gorsich for SCOTUS with only 51 votes, don’t you and that isn’t all. Ultimately as luck would have it the Republicans gained three SCOTUS seats in four years.

If you know all this stuff already, then why is it okay for Republicans to modify the Filibuster but not your own party, the Democrats? They are your party, aren’t they? It seems you are favoring the opposition party, Republicans over your own party.

For starters in today’s divided country and parties it is next to impossible to get 60 votes to overcome the Filibuster since no one party has had sixty senators since 1980 — 42 years.

Should you get your way, and many Democrats lose the right to vote or Republicans over-ride the vote which makes it impossible for Democrats to compete, it will be your fault and realistically since the Republicans control the elections why would they bother with the Filibuster at all anymore.

dailykos,Immigration,"Vladimir Putin may be a lot of things but one thing that is entirely true is that he is reacting just as some pretty smart diplomats predicted more than 20 years ago.

To set the table for this piece, it’s important to remember a few things about Russia:

First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character. This attitude has been prevalent since the days of the tsars. It is good to remember that as ham-fisted as Russia’s actions at home and abroad can be, it is still the country which has given is incredible cultural contributions, from Tolstoy to Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff to Kandinsky and Nijinsky. The list is endless. Yet, it has been—arguably—relatively isolated for centuries.

Second, Russia has been invaded twice in modern times—once by Napoleon and once by Hitler—with absolutely catastrophic consequences for the Russian people, not to mention the invaders.

Third, the soil of central and eastern Europe have absorbed more blood from war than any other part of that continent. Shifting borders from the 16th century onward, among European tribes, nations, and religions have been a regular occurrence in the part of the world.

George Kennan, once described as the smartest modern diplomat we’ve ever had, and the main architect of the 40-year Soviet containment policy during the Truman administration, knew something about Russia.

Kennan knew that every Russian leader understood that Russia’s “neurotic” view of the West was also fed by a series of autocrats who needed conflict as a justification for their rule, the most important of whom was Josef Stalin. As it relates to the present invasion of Ukraine, Kennan’s policy of containment, which was official policy of the Western nations from the 1950’s to the final collapse of the USSR in the 1990’s seems to have been manifestly successful.

In 1997 Kennan, at the age of 93, published and opinion piece in the New York Times advocating for admitting or extending an invitation to former Soviet clients to join NATO. NATO members were keen to bring the Baltic states, Poland and Romania as well as others into the alliance.

NATO had even floated the possibility of Russia itself joining NATO (which went nowhere fast!). Kennan pointed out that here was a newly minted “democratic” Russia, emerging from 70 years of totalitarianism, unsure of itself, it total disarray economically and militarily, its gutted army having just backed out of Afghanistan, its fleet devastated and tied up in port. And now comes NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of the WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit, sharing a border with Mother Russia. The former satellites, themselves afraid of being overrun by the Russian bear once again, quickly jumped on the NATO bus.

In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe and who, thanks for Boris Yeltsin, found himself holding the keys to the Russian kingdom, Over the last 20 years has snuffed out the light of liberty in exchange for the reestablishment of the kind of absolute order he can personally control. And he sees NATO on his front doorstep; and worse, the possibility of a Ukraine NATO member just a few hundred miles from Moscow. Finally, Putin now has his pretext for reacquiring the former client—now members of NATO— states. NATO, he tells his people, is bent on destroying Mother Russia.

Will he move further west? Hard to tell. What is certain, though, is that Putin has taken a huge bite of the apple with Ukraine. Whether he can swallow it is yet to be decided. The same fears now are the same fears of yesteryear among Russia and her leaders. Once again, Putin, ever fearful of western encroachment and more importantly fearing a threat to his rule, has thrown down the gauntlet.","[6, 5, 7, 5]","['The article appears to adopt a fairly neutral tone in its analysis of the dynamics between Russia and the West, specifically focusing on the actions of Vladimir Putin. The article does lean slightly towards a conservative perspective based on the emphasis on national sovereignty, military strategy, and a certain skepticism of rapid democratic transition. \n\n1. ""Vladimir Putin may be a lot of things but one thing that is entirely true is that he is reacting just as some pretty smart diplomats predicted more than 20 years ago.""\n  - This opening sentence suggests a pragmatic viewpoint which does not demonize Putin\'s actions but understands them in a geopolitical context. Such realpolitik outlooks often align more closely with conservative schools of thought.\n\n2. ""First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character.""\n   - The article emphasizes national pride and sovereignty, which are often conservative elements as they value the independence and autonomy of nations. \n\n3. ""And now comes NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of the WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit, sharing a border with Mother Russia.""\n   - This sheds a critical light on NATO\'s expansion, implying it could be seen as a provocation. The questioning of global interventionist initiatives sometimes aligns more with a conservative ideology.\n\n4. ""In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe and who, thanks for Boris Yeltsin, found himself holding the keys to the Russian kingdom...""\n   - By framing Putin\'s geopolitical actions as a response to the ""catastrophe"" of the Soviet Union\'s fall and NATO\'s eastward expansion, this leans slightly right due to its understanding of Putin\'s stance from a realpolitik, instead of purely moral, perspective.\n\n5. ""And he sees NATO on his front doorstep; and worse, the possibility of a Ukraine NATO member just a few hundred miles from Moscow.""\n   - The presentation of this viewpoint implies an understanding and perhaps empathy for the strategic implications from Russia\'s perspective and sheds a critical light on Western tactics. This can often align with conservative viewpoints that promote national sovereignty.\n\n6. ""Finally, Putin now has his pretext for reacquiring the former client—now members of NATO— states...""\n   - The reference to ""pretext"" suggests Putin\'s actions are strategically thought-out moves rather than purely aggressive offenses. This could align with right-leaning ideologies that often scrutinize geopolitical dynamics from a realpolitik and strategic perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the article leans slightly towards a conservative perspective due to its emphasis on the importance of national pride and understanding power dynamics from a realpolitik and strategic perspective, rather than attributing them to moral failings or aggressive intent.', 'The article\'s analysis of Putin\'s invasion of Ukraine and how NATO policy might\'ve influenced his decisions seems to adopt a somewhat realist perspective in international relations, focusing on geopolitical interests and power dynamics, rather than moral considerations or ideological alignment. There are mentions of historical instances underpinning Russia’s position and ensuring balance of power, but it does not fall distinctly into left or right political discourse. \n\n1. ""First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character.""\n   - This statement views Russia through a slightly empathetic lens, attempting to bring a nuanced understanding of its motivations. It aligns with the realist view of countries as primarily driven by self-interest and national pride, without indicating a particular political leaning.\n   \n2. ""Second, Russia has been invaded twice in modern times—once by Napoleon and once by Hitler—with absolutely catastrophic consequences for the Russian people, not to mention the invaders.""\n   - Referencing historical invasions addresses Russia\'s defensive posture, suggesting that Russia\'s geopolitics have been significantly shaped by its past. This historical context doesn\'t distinctly hint at a right-wing or left-wing ideology, but again, fits more into a realist perspective on international relations.\n\n3. ""George Kennan, once described as the smartest modern diplomat we’ve ever had, and the main architect of the 40-year Soviet containment policy during the Truman administration...""\n   - Highlighting a diplomatically strategic approach in the historical containment policy, shows an inclination towards realism —a school of thought that emphasizes the competitive and conflictual side of international relations.\n   \n4. ""In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe...And he sees NATO on his front doorstep; and worse, the possibility of a Ukraine NATO member just a few hundred miles from Moscow.""\n   - The writer presents an understanding of Putin\'s viewpoint given the geopolitical circumstances and perceived threats. While it offers a nuanced view of Putin\'s motivations, it does not distinctly situate itself along the conventional political spectrum. \n\n5. ""Once again, Putin, ever fearful of western encroachment and more importantly fearing a threat to his rule, has thrown down the gauntlet.""\n   - The final paragraph concludes Putin\'s actions as a response to perceived threats from the West. It habituates a descriptive standpoint without making judgments on the actor\'s moral standing—a characteristic of realist perspectives. \n\nOverall, the article brings forth a realist perspective in its analysis of Russia\'s current situation. While it provides contextual information and understanding of Putin\'s motivations, it does not explicitly espouse either right-wing or left-wing ideologies. Its main focus is on power dynamics and geopolitical interests, typical of realism in international relations.', 'The article provides an overview of Russia\'s history, cultural contribution, and geopolitical challenges, focusing on the perceived impacts of NATO\'s enlargement on Russia, and specifically, on Vladimir Putin\'s perception and actions. The piece is moderately conservative-leaning with a pro-Realpolitik undertone. It suggests the west has neglected to consider Russia\'s historical context and wounded pride, leading to its reassertive actions.\n\n1. ""Vladimir Putin may be a lot of things but one thing that is entirely true is that he is reacting just as some pretty smart diplomats predicted more than 20 years ago.""\n    - The statement begins neutrally but implies sympathy with Putin\'s reactivity and the \'smart diplomats\' who foresaw it - typically signifying a realist and right-leaning perspective.\n\n2. ""First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character.""\n    - This statement recognizes Russia\'s national pride and its perceived importance in the international order, hinting at a conservative viewpoint that gives importance to national identity.\n\n3. ""Kennan knew that every Russian leader understood that Russia’s “neurotic” view of the West was also fed by a series of autocrats who needed conflict as a justification for their rule...""\n    - The quotes surrounding \'neurotic\' indicates an understanding that Russia\'s perspective may be overly simplified or misunderstood. This implies a conservative viewpoint, suggesting empathy for Russia\'s historic discontent with the Western world.\n\n4. ""And now comes NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of the WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit, sharing a border with Mother Russia.""\n    - The description of NATO as Russia\'s \'archenemy\' indicates a conservative view sympathetic to Russia\'s geopolitical concerns, hinting at criticism of NATO\'s eastward expansion.\n   \n5. ""In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe...""\n    - The phrase portrays Putin as a deeply patriotic figure witnessing an \'absolute catastrophe,\' indicating a conservative-leaning view that sees Putin\'s actions as defensive rather than offensive.\n\n6. ""And he sees NATO on his front doorstep; and worse, the possibility of a Ukraine NATO member just a few hundred miles from Moscow.""\n    - This statement empathizes with Russia\'s strategic considerations regarding the NATO expansion—a perspective generally seen as conservative-leaning and synonymous with Realpolitik.\n   \n7. ""Once again, Putin, ever fearful of western encroachment and more importantly fearing a threat to his rule, has thrown down the gauntlet.""\n    - The concluding statement underscores Putin\'s fear of Western encroachment, indicating a conservative perspective understanding of Russia\'s geopolitical moves as instinctual self-preservation rather than unprovoked aggression.\n\nIn summary, while maintaining a certain level of neutrality, the article leans towards a conservative, arguably realist viewpoint, empathizing with Russia\'s historical and geopolitical dilemmas and implicitly criticizing NATO\'s failure to consider them.', 'The article seems to exhibit a neutral to slight conservative-leaning political perspective. The article provides a detailed understanding of historic and present Russian politics concerning the NATO alliance and the principles of George Kennan. It doesn\'t explicitly endorse a specific political position, but the tone and manner in which the details are presented align more with a center-to-right leaning viewpoint.\n\n1. ""First, it is a fiercely proud nation. It’s standing among nations, particularly the West, is vitally important to the Russian character.""\n    - A recognition of Russia\'s nationalism, and the emphasis on the importance of national pride suggests a right-leaning view, as nationalism is more frequently associated with conservative ideology.\n\n2. ""Second, Russia has been invaded twice in modern times—once by Napoleon and once by Hitler—with absolutely catastrophic consequences for the Russian people, not to mention the invaders.""\n    - This statement provides historical context for current political actions, which is common across political spectrums, but the highlighting of external threat aligns more with a security-conscious perspective typically associated with right-leaning political views.\n\n3. ""And now comes NATO, Russia’s archenemy since the end of the WWII, offering membership to countries no longer in its orbit, sharing a border with Mother Russia.""\n    - Here, the article presents NATO\'s influence and expansion in a critical light, hinting at a slight anti-interventionist stance which can be characteristic of both right- and left-wing ideologies. However, in the context of U.S. politics, skepticism about international military alliances is often associated with certain conservative viewpoints.\n\n4. ""In the midst of all this change, along comes Putin, an ex-KGB spook, who saw the dissolution the Soviet empire as an absolute catastrophe and who, thanks for Boris Yeltsin, found himself holding the keys to the Russian kingdom,""\n   - This narrative focusing on individual leaders\' personality and actions is more often seen in right-leaning reporting. By centering Putin\'s aspirations and character as, in part, responsible for Russian strategies implies individual favorites and personal ambitions drive the politics instead of systemic characteristics.\n\n5. ""Will he move further west? Hard to tell. What is certain, though, is that Putin has taken a huge bite of the apple with Ukraine. Whether he can swallow it is yet to be decided.""\n   - The neutral prediction and lack of endorsing a particular response could be seen as an absence of overt partisanship, but in the contemporary polarized American political context, such caution and absence of direct critique of Putin can suggest a conservative viewpoint.\n\nIn summary, while the article\'s neutrality is evident, it subtly represents a center-to-right viewpoint based on its discussion of national pride, safety, political leaders, and its neutrality on Russian aggression.']",5.75,0.9574271077563381,0.75
dailykos,Immigration,"I read the Colorado Springs Independent every week — free newspaper with an investigative reporting group that has oversized skills set (llok up the national journalism awards for their staff — impressive). This week they had a really important article here titled:

Charis College is a compound created by Andrew Wommack Ministries — some of you may heard of this one. It is a college that:

here is an emphasis at the college in training students to become political leaders, and the college teaches a version of Young Earth creationism, which is based on a literal interpretation of Genesis, and holds that Earth and all life on it were created in their current forms by the God of Abraham somewhere around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.

This has caused a little concern since Wommack has publicly:

said last April “as many people as we have in this school here, we ought to take over Woodland Park,” it did more than raise a few eyebrows — particularly when he elaborated, saying “this county ought to be totally dominated by believers,” and, “We have enough people here in this school we could elect anybody we want.”

The article is a through look at the confluence of religion and politics in small town America where a national ministry can, in essence, coopt a town.

Woodland Park — the home of Charis — is about 19 miles downtown to downtown — probably closer to 10 miles border to border. El Paso County — home to both Colorado Springs and Woodland Park — is one of the epicenters of evangelical business, broadcasting, and politics.

However, the critique seems more focused on religious dominion and potential theocratic tendencies rather than necessarily expressing a clear stance on government size, regulations, or economic policies that could reveal a specific left- or right-wing ideology.', 'The article appears to have a moderate to slightly left-leaning undertone. It seems to express concern regarding the fusion of religious ideologies with politics, criticizing the impact of a conservative, religious institution\'s influence on a small town and its political landscape.\n\n1. ""There is an emphasis at the college in training students to become political leaders, and the college teaches a version of Young Earth creationism, which is based on a literal interpretation of Genesis, and holds that Earth and all life on it were created in their current forms by the God of Abraham somewhere around 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.""\n   - The exposure of the college\'s intent to train religious students into political leaders might indicate opposition to the merging of conservative religious values with politics. This is a perspective often associated with progressive or left-leaning viewpoints, which tend to be secular and caution against intertwining religion with governance.\n\n2. ""This has caused a little concern since Wommack has publicly said last April “as many people as we have in this school here, we ought to take over Woodland Park,” it did more than raise a few eyebrows.""\n   - Highlighting the concern about the clergy\'s intent to dominate local politics seems to express apprehension about the potential consequences of religiously motivated political power. Such a critique aligns more with left-leaning ideologies that uphold the importance of secular governance.\n\n3. ""The article is a through look at the confluence of religion and politics in small town America where a national ministry can, in essence, coopt a town.""\n   - The use of the term ""coopt a town"" seems to express disapproval of religious institutions wielding significant political influence in communities. Again, this perspective aligns more with a progressive or left-leaning viewpoint.\n\n4. ""El Paso County — home to both Colorado Springs and Woodland Park — is one of the epicenters of evangelical business, broadcasting, and politics.""\n   - The article frames the region as an ""epicenter"" of evangelical influence, which might suggest concern about the implications of such influence on societal norms and politics. Progressives or left-leaning individuals often voice such apprehensions.\n\nOverall, the article appears to exhibit moderate to slight left-leaning tendencies. It criticizes the intersection of religion and politics, showing apprehension about the potential influence a religious institution could have on a small town\'s political agenda. This aligns more commonly with progressive ideologies that emphasize the importance of secular governance.']",4.75,0.5,0.5
dailykos,Police,"There are some basic qualifications for sitting on the Supreme Count of the United States (SCOTUS). These include:
• Not Lying or Committing Perjury in Confirmation Hearings:

Objectively speaking: Justice Alito, Justice Thomas, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett, have failed to show they are qualified to sit on the Court. As such, they NO LONGER meet the standards require to serve.

Article. III. SECTION. 1. States: “The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, … .”

The current make-up of the Court is:

The Constitution does not define what “Good Behaviour” is, but certainly; it includes a respect for the institution of the Court itself. The “leaked” Alito Draft opinion (Alito Draft) in the Dobbs v. Jackson case; reveals a fundamental disrespect for the Court and its precedents. Further, the opinion itself presents a FAILURE of even the most rudimentary basis of intellectual honesty. It displays an open contempt for the intelligence of the American people, by asserting that somehow, the Roe Court simply did not know what they were doing; and that this Court somehow has a better understanding of the law than any in the past. It defies all intellectual reasoning to say that Roe can be excised from the pantheon of judicial history, but that doing so will not undermine all other decisions. It is the ONLY TIME in the history of America, that the Court has proposed to “REMOVE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT” (as opposed to recognizing a previously undefine right, or expanding the understanding of rights to a new social circumstance). IT IS AKIN TO WHAT THE NAZI’S DID IN GERMANY IN DECLARING CERTAIN GROUPS ‘UNDESIRABLE’. The fundamental Constitutional right to access medical services to terminate a pregnancy HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR FIFTY YEARS. By July 1, 2022, that right will CEASE TO EXIST; as will every right that has been described under the “privacy” and Roe precedent.

Many times in our country’s history, the Court has been called upon to apply the fundamental nature of our democracy and freedom in terms more broadly construed than the existing precedent recognized. Many times, they refused (eg. Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393 (1856)). When they have, history has UNIVERSALLY panned the decisions as unprincipled and erroneously decided.

This case is different. Never has the Court acted to ELIMINATE an existing recognized Constitutional right, NEVER.

This is exactly what this Court is about to do; ELIMINATE a long-standing, recognized federal constitutional right. Further, their motivation for doing so is simply that THEY NOW HAVE A COURT WITH FIVE MEMBERS WILLING TO IGNOR THEIR OATHS AND DUTIES, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT ONLY HAS BASIS WITHIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL DOGMA. Nothing more. That is TYRANNY AT ITS WORST. More so, in that a vast majority of the public DO NOT SUPPORT THIS POSTION, DECISION, OR DOGMA.

We need to start calling this for what it REALLY IS: a JUDICIAL COUP; acting in operation to OVERTHROW the elected government, by judicial fiat. Upon this precedence, these five member could decide to declare the Pope the new president of the United States (and have in essence done just exactly that).

In addition, these justices have done exactly what they asserted (under oath) that they would not do: ignore the doctrine of Stare Decisis and overturn Roe.

I assert, that the Congress can and must, declare that these Justice NO LONGER SERVE UNDER THE TERMS OF “GOOD BEHAVIOUR”; and remove them from their positions.

The Constitution of the United States presents that the President must be Impeached (by The House of Representatives) and Convicted (by the Senate) to be removed from office (upon the qualifying offenses). It further presents that the individual body of the Congress, shall have the authority to determine the qualifications of its member to serve or continue serving. This process DOES NOT REQUIRE IMPEACHMENT (under the clear text of the constitution and its construction; “impeachment” is reserved for removal of the President, Vice-President, and the EXECUTIUVE BRANCH “OFFICERS”, as a necessity for removal from office. It is presented within the context of Article I (Legislative branch) and Article II (Executive branch): BUT IT IS NOT REPEATED under Article III (in regards to the Judicial branch). Thus, removal from office of a judicial branch member, requires only the CAUSE OF ACTION (violation of the “Good Behaviour” provision) and a majority vote of the Congress. As the Constitution provides the President the authority to nominate judges. This would suggest that any action to declare that a Judicial Officer is no longer qualified to hold a judicial position, because they are no longer compliant with the requirement of “Good Behaviour”, would likewise require the President to declare such to the Congress (stating the case against the Judicial Officer), in a Writ of Removal.

It is thus, that President Biden MUST IMMEDIATELTY DECLARE THESE FIVE JUSTICES NO LONGER FIT FOR OFFICE, AND REQUEST THAT CONGRESS VOTE TO REMOVE THEM DUE TO “BAD BEHAVIOUR”.","[6, 7, 6, 7]","['The article largely supports a left-wing or liberal perspective, criticizing the qualifications of multiple conservative Justices on the Supreme Court and suggesting the removal of these Justices due to perceived violations of ""Good Behaviour."" \n\n1.

The fundamental Constitutional right to access medical services to terminate a pregnancy HAS BEEN THE LAW FOR FIFTY YEARS.""\n   - The comparison of current justices\' actions to those of the Nazis and referencing the ""fundamental Constitutional right"" to abortion services, suggests a liberal viewpoint as it advocates for freedom of choice in regards to reproductive rights.\n\n4. ""Further, their motivation for doing so is simply that THEY NOW HAVE A COURT WITH FIVE MEMBERS WILLING TO IGNOR THEIR OATHS AND DUTIES, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT ONLY HAS BASIS WITHIN THEIR OWN PERSONAL DOGMA.""\n   - The assertion that the conservative members of the court are acting based on personal dogma rather than legal interpretation draws upon a fundamentally left-wing argument that decisions should be made free from personal religious or moral convictions. \n\n5. ""We need to start calling this for what it REALLY IS: a JUDICIAL COUP; acting in operation to OVERTHROW the elected government, by judicial fiat.""\n   - The depiction of the current court\'s actions as a ""judicial coup"" positions the author in alignment with liberal ideologies which posit imbalance in the current Supreme Court.\n\n6. ""In addition, these justices have done exactly what they asserted (under oath) that they would not do: ignore the doctrine of Stare Decisis and overturn Roe.""\n   - The suggestion that justices are violating oaths and legal principles by attempting to overturn Roe v.

""In addition, these justices have done exactly what they asserted (under oath) that they would not do: ignore the doctrine of Stare Decisis and overturn Roe.""\n   - The strong assertion of the justices not following Stare Decisis and overturning Roe suggests a liberal ideology, as this criticism aligns with left-wing concern about the potential for the Supreme Court to alter or undermine long-standing precedents on issues like reproductive rights.\n\n7.

infowars,Abortion,"Employees of these woke companies who live in red states will still be able to obtain abortions should Roe v. Wade be overturned.

Since conservative-leaning states began flexing their legislative muscles to outlaw abortion within their borders or severely limit its practice, companies from the likes of Amazon to Yelp have been drafting policies that will pay for employees’ abortions should they live in a state that outlaws the practice. After Politico published the leaked Supreme Court decision indicating that Roe v. Wade may be in its final days, more and more companies have been actively considering implementing such a practice, with none other than Amazon joining the fold this week.

Amazon became the latest corporation to cover employees’ travel costs to seek abortion care. The company told staff it would pay up to $4,000 in travel expenses annually for medical treatments including abortions, according to a message seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the nature of the Reuters report to CNN Business.

Amazon joined Citigroup, Yelp, Uber, Lyft, Bumble, Match Group, and Salesforce to draft such a policy. On Tuesday, Levi Strauss & Co. reminded its employees that its current benefits program will grant reimbursements “for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.” The company said:

Access to reproductive health care, including abortion, has been a critical factor to the workplace gains and contributions women have made over the past 50 years. Further restricting or criminalizing access will jeopardize that progress and disproportionately affect women of color, putting their well-being at risk and impeding diverse hiring pipelines. Women in some states would have fewer rights than women in others, and our country would be consigned to a more unjust and inequitable future.

infowars,Abortion,"Roger Stone believes Fla. Gov. Ron DeSantis intends to run for president, and will announce his candidacy after the upcoming midterms.

Stone also suggested that if the GOP falls short in the midterms, which is a possibility, Donald Trump doesn’t want to take the blame, especially if congressional Republicans throw the election away – and DeSantis equally doesn’t want attention prior to the midterms.

“I happen to believe that Gov. Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor – my governor – intends to announce his candidacy literally, immediately, after the election, and I think [Trump] needs to remain mindful of that,” Stone said on the Alex Jones Show. “I still think it is more likely than not that he will be a candidate.”

“…That’s not just my instinct, that’s hard intelligence and, by the way, as President Donald Trump has said, Ron DeSantis has the right to do that.”

Trump had told insiders he was going to announce his own candidacy back in July, which never materialized, and Stone implied that it was because Trump didn’t want to influence the midterm races among other things.

It is quite likely that had Trump announced his run, it may have galvanized more Democrats to vote in November.

Additionally, if the GOP leadership threw the midterm elections to Democrats, they could’ve then blamed the loss on Trump announcing his candidacy beforehand.

On the other hand, if the GOP performs poorly in the midterms, Trump will likely blame RINO Republicans who have spoke out against “America First” candidates.

Case in point, Stone also warned that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was working behind the scenes with Democrats to keep focus on abortion and to make a major issue in the upcoming election – despite the fact that provides no upside to the GOP.

“I think Lindsey Graham – a classic RINO – working with the Democrats to make abortion front-and-center in this election,” he said.

In short, both Trump and DeSantis don’t want to be in the spotlight by announcing their runs before the midterms.

“All elections are about the incumbent party, about the job being done by congressional Democrats in combination with the Biden White House,” Stone stated.

He also threw cold water on the idea that Trump and DeSantis would run together, stating that the electoral college would get in the way as both are from Florida.

“You cannot have a president and a vice president from the same state because, if you do, you would forfeit the electoral votes of Florida 27 votes – that’s too precious for us to do,” he explained.","[8, 7, 7, 6]","['The article discusses the potential 2024 U.S. presidential candidacies of former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov.

U.S. regulators are urging drugmaker Pfizer to apply for emergency authorization for a two-dose regimen of its COVID-19 vaccine for children in the age group, a person familiar with the matter told the Washington Post on Monday.

Officials are aiming to to clear the way for the shots to be used as soon as late February, the source said.

Meanwhile, regulators are also awaiting data on a three-dose course that they hope will prove more effective for children, the Associated Press has reported.

The company’s application was expected to be submitted as soon as Tuesday.

However, research shows that Covid poses a very low risk to babies and toddlers, and previous decisions to offer vaccines to children have caused controversy.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data shows as of January 22, there have been 280 deaths involving Covid among children aged between zero and four years old. That number rises to 603 for those aged from five to 18 years old.

Combined, deaths involving Covid among those 18-and-under make up around 0.102 percent of America’s 864,256 total deaths, as of January 22.

infowars,COVID,"A physician family practice in New Jersey has begun screening COVID-vaccinated student athletes for risk of “sudden cardiac arrest” before competing.

The Morris Sussex Family Practice announced on its website that in response to worldwide reports of adverse events in vaccinated athletes, student athletes who’ve been vaccinated cannot be cleared to compete until they undergo lab work and a heart imaging test.

Sports physicals are done primarily to make sure you are not at high risk for sudden cardiac death on the playing field. In response to worldwide experience and vaccine adverse event monitoring, we are adopting a more precautionary sports physical sign off policy. ​If you have received doses of any Covid vaccine, we will not be able to clear you to compete in sports without performing lab work and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out potential heart damage.

The precautionary measures by this practice come as athletes across the world were observed collapsing in the field or during game play since the rollout of the experimental COVID jab, resulting in death in many cases.

Such disclaimers are likely to become more common as the dangerous side effects of the COVID-19 injection, such as myocarditis and pericarditis, continue to be documented.

Alarmingly, a report from pathologist Steve Kirsch found that 1 in 70 students at a private Christian academy in California alone were diagnosed with myocarditis, contradicting the CDC’s estimate of 1 in 13,000 incidence rate.

Additionally, a major study from Scandinavia looking at over 23 million patient records found that in the over-12s populations of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden from the start of the vaccine rollout, severe myocarditis (requiring inpatient hospital admission) was around five times more common in individuals who took the Pfizer shot and 14 times more common after taking the Moderna shot.","[5, 5, 6, 4]","['The rhetorical analysis of this article indicates a narrative that is skeptical and critical of the COVID-19 vaccines.

infowars,Climate Change,"A flashback video making its rounds online this week shows then-President Donald Trump warning during a 2018 speech at the UN that Germany could soon be “totally dependent on Russian energy.“

After the 45th president put the Germans on notice, the nation’s UN representatives and the mainstream media scoffed at his warning.

Popular social media page NowThis called Trump’s claims “outrageous” and noted the German delegation had a “priceless” reaction by laughing at the president.

The NowThis video called Trump’s remark an “inaccurate claim” and cited CNBC, who called the comment “not accurate” and “highly misleading.”

Shadi Hamid, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, posted on Twitter Sunday mocking mainstream media for fact-checking Trump on a future prediction.

Now, Germany and several other European countries are experiencing an energy crisis that could have deadly results.

Articles with titles such as “Germany Is Already Struggling to Keep the Lights On” and “Why Germany’s Energy Crisis and Euro Weakness Spell Trouble For The Euro Zone” are flooding media outlets.

Europe’s sanctions on Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine have placed a strain on energy grids in several nations.

Russia reduced the supply of natural gas flowing to Germany in response to sanctions and could completely cut them off if necessary.

While “Germany is considering operating its 3 remaining nuclear reactors that are scheduled to be shuttered by the end of the year through this winter,” according to the Institute for Energy Research, the nation still relies on Russia for most of its uranium fuel.

The Institute for Energy Research also points out, “Germany also gets 34 percent of its oil from Russia and 53 percent of its hard coal supplies.”

Earlier this month, Russia announced it would be shutting down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline for a three-day maintenance operation at the end of August.

CNN reported the pipeline shutdown is “reigniting fears that Moscow could completely shut off gas to Europe, which is racing to stockpile supplies ahead of the winter.”

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck did attempt to spread optimism on Monday, telling citizens the nation’s gas storage facilities should soon “reach the 85% threshold.”

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Cabinet met for an energy summit on Tuesday, telling the media, “Coal power plants are being connected to the power grid again, bit by bit, and as you know, we are also looking into whether it makes sense to restart nuclear power plants for the winter through a careful stress test.”

“We’re in a much better situation now than was foreseeable several months ago and we are much more able to deal with the threats coming from Russia over the cutting off of gas supplies,” he added.

Meanwhile, Germany’s largest natural gas importer Uniper asked the government for an additional €4 billion ($4 billion) bailout this week.

infowars,Climate Change,"Scientists have announced that a remarkable planet could reveal the mysteries of many space formations, after water vapor was detected in its atmosphere.

Listed under the name TOI-674 b, the exoplanet – so called because it orbits not around the Sun, but another star – has a promising element in its detectable atmosphere. Jonathan Brande of the University of Kansas, who led the study by an international team of scientists, revealed on Thursday that water vapor had recently been discovered there.

The planet, which Brande dubbed “very rare,” orbits a red dwarf star located some 150 light years away from Earth. A light year is equivalent to six trillion miles (or 9.7 trillion kilometers), but the distance is still considered “nearby” in astronomical terms, according to NASA. The US space agency said it would now be the subject of a detailed exploration.

While researchers don’t yet know exactly how much water vapor TOI-674 b’s atmosphere holds, they have already figured out some other salient details. The exoplanet is about 1.3 times the size of Neptune and about 23 times the mass of Earth. It orbits its small and relatively cool star very tightly, completing a full circle in less than two days – that’s the length of a “year” on TOI-674 b. For comparison, it takes Neptune some 165 years to complete its journey around the Sun.

Referred to as a ‘Super Neptune’ planet for its size class, the space body, enveloped as it is in gases, is extremely rare. While thousands of exoplanets have been confirmed in our galaxy, only few in the size class between Neptune and Jupiter are known to orbit their stars in three days or less. It is believed atmospheres do not usually survive such proximity to the stars.

The close distance of an exoplanet with a detectable atmosphere to its parent star likely shows that TOI-674 b was born somewhere further away and then migrated to where it is now, according to Brande.

“Planets the size of Neptune and a bit bigger are very uncommon in these orbits – in what astronomers call the Neptune desert,” he said, speaking at a press conference for the latest meeting of the American Astronomical Society. He added that “planets in the desert are very rare,” suggesting that many of those have lost their atmospheres due to stellar radiation.

The parent star of the new subject of the astronomers’ attention cannot be seen from Earth with the naked eye. However, the exoplanet became accessible to telescopes with a high enough resolution to observe its atmosphere in greater detail. It “has a very large transit signal,” according to Brande.

The planet was first found by NASA’s transiting exoplanet survey satellite and further explored by the Hubble space telescope. Now researchers hope its atmosphere could be studied in more detail by another telescope equipped with special instruments called spectrographs, which can reveal certain gases.

The discovery of water vapor doesn’t make TOI-674 b a candidate for potential habitability, but it does position it as a prime target for future studies of planet formations in the star system. Looking into the chemical structure of its atmosphere in more detail will explain how it, and other stars, formed and traveled in the universe.","[5, 5, 5, 6]","['This article uses neutral language and rhetoric to report on the scientific findings of water vapor on exoplanet TOI-674 b.

infowars,Economy,"In this world of monetary insanity, defenders of central bank constant easing try every day to convince you that inflation is caused by numerous factors, not by currency printing.

Many blame inflation on cost-push factors or even speculation, but ultimately all those are consequences, not causes. Rising prices are always caused by more units of currency being directed to scarce or tangible assets.

Commodities exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a clear example. In 2022, investors have been purchasing these products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns. These purchases are not a cause; they are a consequence. With increased inflationary concerns, the likelihood of rising interest rates, and elevated geopolitical concerns, commodity-focused funds have seen record inflows in 2022. Year to date through February 25, commodities ETFs gathered $8.5 billion of net ETF inflows, according to Wealthmanagement.com. This is not the full picture, though. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the total value of various commodity index-related instruments purchased by institutional investors has increased from an estimated $15 billion in 2003 to an estimated $200 billion. The global commodity-services market size is estimated at $4 trillion in 2020, according to Market Research.

In 2020, most investors were very underweight in energy and commodities. The surge in socially responsible investment as well as the recent history of underperformance of commodities relative to bonds and equities had created an enormous underweight. As concerns about inflation and geopolitical events unraveled, funds reallocated capital from underweight to equal weight and now, in 2022, to overweight.

This happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy. Between 2020 and 2021, the assets of the major central banks rose by more than $10 trillion. Furthermore, broad money supply (M3) growth rose at a double-digit rate in 2020 and 2021 in the major economies.

Obviously one or two prices may rise independently due to particular events. A war can cause that, but not a generalized and widespread increase in all prices. Furthermore, commodity and food prices were already rising to multiyear highs even before the Ukraine invasion was a rumor.

Readers may believe that all this is due to trader speculation, but trader actions work both ways. Traders do not create prices; they trade on them. Furthermore, traders cannot influence the marginal price of a commodity for long if the fundamentals, inflation, and money reality are not there. There are numerous reports from the CFTC proving that investing does not impact commodity prices. Between 2013 and 2019, commodity prices were not rising. Why? Because broad money growth was not rising above real demand for money.

Oil and gas have risen equally everywhere, yet Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is vastly different in the euro area and the United States compared to countries where energy imports are much higher, like Japan and Korea. Why is CPI inflation twice as high in the euro area and the US relative to those Asian countries? Much higher broad money growth in 2020–21.

The Ukraine war has created another excuse to blame inflation on oil and natural gas. However, it seems that all those who blame inflationary pressures on commodities continue to ignore the massive price increases in housing, healthcare, and education, as well as in goods and services where there was evident overcapacity. Global food prices show a similar problem. The United Nations and Food and Agriculture Organization Food Price Index has been rising steadily and reached all-time highs even before the covid crisis.

Oil and gas will be used as an excuse for inflation as long as low interest rates and massive currency creation remain. But the reality is that when both deflate somehow, the problem of currency debasement will remain.

Inflation was already higher than the CPI measure suggested before the covid-19 crisis. The rise in the prices of nonreplicable goods and services, shelter, healthcare, fresh food, and education was significantly higher than the CPI percentage. According to Deutsche Bank, these were rising up to five times faster than the CPI. There was high inflation in the things that we consume every day even in the days when some said there was “no inflation.”

Now the increase in broad money has translated to an explosion in all prices, energy-related or not. Some will blame wages, others will blame the Ukraine war, and others will blame the weak recovery. The fact is that currency destruction is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere. Everything else is anecdotes or consequences, not causes.

More units of currency are going to scarce assets as investors look for protection against inflation. This is not speculation; it is protection from currency debasement.","[5, 6, 6, 6]","['The language and reporting style of this article reflect a neutral to slight conservative-leaning ideological perspective with a focus on economic policy and monetary theories, particularly those linked to inflation. Though economic analysis is generally non-political, the stance against monetary easing indirectly aligns more with fiscal conservatism, which supports minimal intervention in the economy. \n\n1. ""In this world of monetary insanity, defenders of central bank constant easing try every day to convince you that inflation is caused by numerous factors, not by currency printing.""\n   - The article starts by criticizing \'defenders of central bank constant easing.\' This indirectly opposes expansionary monetary polices typically favored by left-wing ideologues that believe in state intervention, thus positioning the article\'s perspective as more conservative-leaning.\n\n2. ""Rising prices are always caused by more units of currency being directed to scarce or tangible assets.""\n   - This statement favorably cites the quantity theory of money, a model often adopted by fiscal conservatives, implying a slight right-leaning bias. \n\n3. ""This happened at the same time as central banks injected unprecedented quantities of money into the economy.""\n   - The negative portrayal of central banks\' strategies during the pandemic—common strategies include decreasing interest rates and increasing money supply to stimulate the economy—implies an endorsement of conservative or libertarian economic principles that argue for lesser state involvement in the economy.\n\n4. ""The fact is that currency destruction is at the heart of generalized price rises everywhere. Everything else is anecdotes or consequences, not causes.""\n   - Here, the article supports the idea that currency devaluation due to central banking policies is the core issue behind inflation. This aligns with a fiscal conservative viewpoint that is wary of governmental intervention in monetary policies.\n\n5. ""More units of currency are going to scarce assets as investors look for protection against inflation. This is not speculation; it is protection from currency debasement.""\n   - In arguing that investors are seeking refuge from inflation in tangible assets, the author implicitly criticizes policies leading to inflation, indicating a slightly conservative-leaning economic stance.\n\nIn summary, the article takes a critical stance against expansionary monetary policies, a position more often associated with conservative economic theories. However, it does not display explicit partisan biases, hence maintaining a relatively neutral political tone while showing a more conservative-leaning economic perspective.', 'This article leans towards a right-wing or libertarian perspective. It employs economic arguments against central bank monetary easing policies, decrying the inflation such policies often result in, and is critical of government intervention in markets.\n\n1. ""In this world of monetary insanity, defenders of central bank constant easing try every day to convince you that inflation is caused by numerous factors, not by currency printing.""\n   - Arguably, the term ""monetary insanity"" critically refers to government, and specifically central banks\' policies; often those arguing for less government intervention in markets, a common feature of right-wing or libertarian ideology, level this form of criticism.\n\n2. ""Rising prices are always caused by more units of currency being directed to scarce or tangible assets.""\n   - The implication here is that it is government intervention—via creation of more units of currency—that is causing the inflation, again this is a right-leaning viewpoint based on an ideal of limited government intervention into the market.\n\n3. ""In 2020, most investors were very underweight in energy and commodities. The surge in socially responsible investment as well as the recent history of underperformance of commodities relative to bonds and equities had created an enormous underweight.""\n   - This sentiment – questioning or criticizing socially responsible investing (SRI) – tends to align more with right-wing ideologies; left-leaning ideologies champion SRI as a tool for advancing societal goals.\n\n4. ""The Ukraine war has created another excuse to blame inflation on oil and natural gas. However, it seems that all those who blame inflationary pressures on commodities continue to ignore the massive price increases in housing, healthcare, and education, as well as in goods and services where there was evident overcapacity.""\n   - Clearly, the author is critical of those who blame inflation on external factors like war, or the rising costs of commodities; this implies a belief in market-driven economics, as opposed to government regulatory interventions, consistent with right-leaning ideologies.\n\n5. ""Oil and gas will be used as an excuse for inflation as long as low interest rates and massive currency creation remain. But the reality is that when both deflate somehow, the problem of currency debasement will remain.""\n   - Again, the author doesn\'t believe that external factors are to blame for inflation; this inclination to see the flaws of currency debasement primarily in government policy rather than market dynamics is typical of right-leaning economic thought.\n\n6. ""More units of currency are going to scarce assets as investors look for protection against inflation. This is not speculation; it is protection from currency debasement.""\n   - The article ends with a right-leaning viewpoint, emphasizing free-market behaviors among investors and dismissing the idea that speculation drives inflation. Instead, it argues that investors are justified in seeking to protect themselves against a perceived problem created by government policy.\n\nTo sum up, the article seems to advocate for free-market economics over government intervention, implying a right-wing or libertarian ideological stance.', 'The article has a conservative or libertarian leaning, as it critically analyzes the monetary policy of central banks and suggests a free-market approach to understanding the causes of inflation. \n\n1.

In 2022, investors have been purchasing these products to protect themselves from inflation and generate real returns.

This stance can be seen as consistent with conservative or libertarian perspectives that stress the role of government monetary policy in economic issues.\n\n5. ""Oil and gas will be used as an excuse for inflation as long as low interest rates and massive currency creation remain.""\n   - The author strongly critiqued the notion that oil and gas prices are to blame for rising inflation, instead blaming low interest rates and the overproduction of currency. This statement aligns with a conservative or libertarian worldview that critiques central banking policies.\n\n6.

infowars,Economy,"A recent essay on the Mises Wire triggered quite a bit of discussion among a group of Austrian school economists.

Paul H. Kupiec and Alex J. Pollock’s “Who Owns Federal Reserve Losses and How Will They Impact Monetary Policy?” became the focal point for a wide-ranging discussion of monetary issues that got to the heart of our monetary and overall economic future.

The Fed Cannot Go Bankrupt

The article itself is a fairly straightforward explanation of how the Fed works, and provides several options that the Fed might pursue in a rising interest rate environment. The authors contend that the Fed has intervened itself into a corner, where losses probably will increase as the Fed raises rates. David Howden opined that this might not happen, as the Fed will roll over its mostly short-term, low-yielding investments into higher-earning assets, which will tend to protect its net interest income and provide an operating profit. Furthermore, the Fed is not required to mark its low-yielding investments to market. Were it required to do so, the Fed’s true financial weakness would be revealed.

The Fed Ignores the Rule of Law

But what can or will be done about it? Early in their essay, Kupiec and Pollock conclude that nothing will be done, despite the provisions of the law that created the Fed over one hundred years ago. The losses will not go away; they simply will be transferred to the unwitting public through loss of purchasing power. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

The “innovation” in accounting policies centers around the Fed’s newly minted “deferred asset” account, to which underwater assets will be transferred. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

If the Fed were subject to the rule of law, either it would have stopped money printing years ago or its creditors would have forced it to close its doors. Yet the rule of law is completely ignored. Per Kupiec and Pollock:

The Keynesians running our economic life may be reassured that the Fed cannot fail in a technical sense, but the public should be appalled. The continual monetization of the federal budget threatens the complete loss of the dollar’s purchasing power—to wit, a Weimar Republic–style catastrophe.

Today’s monetary leaders fail to understand the true nature of money and, therefore, cannot conceive that there are real consequences to their outlandish irresponsibility in monetizing government debt and brazenly dismissing the rule of law. As the facilitator of monetary debasement, borne by the general public, the Fed fosters the destruction of societal capital.

The federal government does not have to answer to the law nor the public for its irresponsible and destructive spending. The purpose of insolvency is to force an institution, whether public or private, to stop destroying capital. Austrian school economists understand that capital must be created by hard work, innovation, frugality, and, most of all, savings. The market allocates scarce capital to those enterprises that create things worth more than those scarce inputs.

The Solution Is a “Return to Sound Money”

In 1953 Ludwig von Mises added a relatively short final chapter to his 1913 masterpiece The Theory of Money and Credit. Chapter 3 of part 4 is titled “The Return to Sound Money.” It is as relevant today as it was almost seventy years ago. Mises explains how the US in particular could anchor the dollar to its gold reserves. The Fed would be eliminated and replaced by little more than a board that would monitor all dollars to make sure they are backed 100 percent by gold.

Mises was a master in presenting what self-serving Keynesian scholars try to hide in a fog of deception; i.e., that money can and should be subject to the rule of law, as are all other economic goods in society. I daresay that there is no single reform that comes closer to fostering peace, freedom, and prosperity than a “return to sound money.”","[8, 8, 9, 5]","['The provided article involves monetary policy discussions among Austrian school economists.

This is an extreme threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.”

Continuing, the press secretary laughably said, “They [MAGA Republicans] just don’t respect the rule of law. You’ve heard that from the president and they are pursuing an agenda that takes away people’s rights, which is what the president said last week, you all heard him. This is what the president said yesterday and that’s what he’s going to continue to say. The president is not going to shy away to call out what he clearly sees is happening in this country. Again, MAGA Republicans are this extreme part of their party and that is just facts.”

Later during the Wednesday press conference, Jean-Pierre named several GOP politicians and claimed they publicly support violence.

Each instance KJP referred to was either extremely exaggerated or outright false.

After calling tens of millions of American voters violent extremists, the White House Press Secretary dodged a question from a reporter about how Biden would differentiate “ultra MAGA” folks from the average GOP voter, suddenly saying she “can’t talk about voters from here.”

The Democrat Party is consistently choosing to promote the narrative that Republican voters and politicians are the enemy of Democrat voters as Joe Biden also called GOP voters “semi-fascists” last week.

The current chair of the Democratic National Committee Jaime Harrison defended the comments on CBS News this week.

The clearly divisive and hypocritical rhetoric was slammed online.

Breitbart podcast host Joel Pollack called on Jean-Pierre to “resign” for the “inflammatory message.”

Pinned to the top of the Democrat congresswoman’s Twitter page is a video of Pelosi announcing she’s running for re-election.

“While we have made progress much more needs to be done to improve people’s lives,” Pelosi wrote. “This election is crucial: nothing less is at stake than our Democracy. But we don’t agonize, we organize. I am running for re-election to Congress to deliver For The People and defend Democracy.”

Footage of the decaying state of California was added to the background of the announcement, with Johnson titling the new clip, “Accurate Nancy Pelosi re-election video.”

As Pelosi panders to the liberal mob in the re-election declaration, viewers can see images of the poop-filled streets of San Francisco, mass looting of retail shops, heroin needles, rampant homelessness and more.

After the mock re-election video surpassed Pelosi’s original post in shares, Johnson captured it with a screenshot and posted, “LOL REKT.”

infowars,Immigration,"In a hopeful sign of de-escalation, Ukrainian officials said they will meet Russian counterparts at the Belarus border, shortly after Vladimir Putin said he is putting Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert.

In a Facebook post, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Ukraine has agreed to talks with Russia on the Belarusian-Ukrainian border.

“We have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with Russian without prior conditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, in the area of the Pripyat River,” Zelenskiy said. A delegation has already left Kyiv, Fedir Venislavskyi, a member of Zelenskiy’s party, said in televised comments.

The Ukraine foreign minister said that he will go to listen to what Russia has to say and that he will not surrender territory.

The confirmation came after Russia earlier sent a negotiation team to the southeastern Belarusian city of Gomel. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the “Russian delegation is ready for talks, and we are now waiting for the Ukrainians” in the Belarusian city of Homel, per AP.

In response, Zelensky said in a video address that he’s open to talks, but not in Belarus which he said was not neutral territory.

“If there had been no aggressive action from your territory, we could talk in Minsk … other cities can be used as the venue for talks,” Zelensky said. “We want peace, we want to meet, we want an end to the war,” he added. “Warsaw, Bratislava, Budapest, Istanbul, Baku — we proposed all that to the Russian side. Any other city would work for us, too, in a country from whose territory rockets are not being fired.”

While an encouraging development, this won’t be the first time that the two nations have exchanged proposals for a potential ceasefire, only to see the plans collapse.

The news helped push the weekend IG spread market for the “weekend Dow” higher by about 150 points although it remains well in the red from Friday’s close.

Meanwhile, in the latest battlefield developments, overnight Russian forces on Sunday attacked Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-biggest city. Much of Europe has closed its airspace to Russia, and offers of military assistance continue to flow in.

infowars,Immigration,"Update (1500ET): While in a normal world this would be beyond satire and ridicule, it is perhaps of no surprise whatsoever that the blame for instigation of the “Freedom Convoy” is already being placed on so-called ‘Russian actors’…

“…given Canada’s support of Ukraine… I don’t know it it’s far-fetched to ask but there is concern that Russian actors could be continuing to fuel things as this protest grows… perhaps even instigating it…”

As Brian Lilley writes at The Toronto Sun, “the media in this country is not acting as a neutral observer and conduit for news on this matter, most have decided the trucker convoy is the enemy and are treating it as such. Watch any of the news networks or, more importantly, read the Twitter accounts of supposedly objective journalists, or listen to the contempt in their voices as they ask questions to see that they have clearly taken sides.”

The propaganda seems to have reached some, but not others…

In other news, while Trudeau hides in isolation, the Premier of Saskatchewan, a Canadian province that borders the US, calls for an end of the cross-border ban on unvaccinated truckers.

The world’s largest truck convoy rolled into Canada’s capital, Ottawa, late Friday night and continues today to stage a protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cross-border vaccine mandates (or as some call it: medical tyranny).

The so-called “Freedom Convoy” – coming from all corners of Canada and even the US, has been traveling all week and is leading the charge in a massive demonstration against government overreach. Truckers from around the world are uniting and staging protests of their own.

As Enrico Trigoso reports at The Epoch Times, Brian Von D, the administrator at “Convoy to DC 2022” announced that they will “join forces” to ride from California to Washington, adding that “America is next.”

He added that dates and planned routes would be released soon on a website and various social media platforms, and a GoFundMe page would only be released on their CONVOY TO DC 2022 Facebook page.

The Parliamentary Protective Service expects as many as 10,000 protesters this weekend in Ottawa, but that figure could be significantly higher. A day ago, we noted 50,000 trucks in a 70km (43.5 miles) long convoy are headed to the capital.

According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the Freedom Convoy is “the largest parade of trucks” ever in the world.

The trucker convoy has been arriving in the capital for the past 12 hours. Additional waves of the convoy will arrive later this afternoon.

Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau called the convoy a “small fringe minority” of those who “do not represent the views of Canadians.” Judging by the pictures and videos so far, Trudeau is a liar, and a revolt is underway in the country. Corporate media and government have spent the better part of the week downplaying the convoy ( because they are scared).

On Friday, Trudeau told the Canadian Press that he was worried about the protest turning violent. Organizers of the event have told truckers and anyone else participating in the demonstration to remain peaceful.

CBC said Trudeau and his family left downtown Ottawa on Saturday morning (due to close contact with someone infected with COVID – although he tested negative and triple-jabbed) as the trucker convoy descended on the area. The local news said he left town due to security concerns.

The convoy is expected to bring parts of the metro area to a standstill and block roads in front of parliament until lawmakers repeal a vaccine mandate for truckers hauling freight across the border.

Despite Trudeau calling the protest “small,” Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly said they planned a “massive” demonstration on Friday.","[8, 7, 5, 5]","['This article appears to promote libertarian or far-right-leaning ideology, characterized by supporting the concept of freedom, resistance to mandates and distrust of mainstream media.\n\n1.

infowars,Police,"A woman was arrested after allegedly stealing a police car and crashing it into a tree in Missouri this week, according to reports.

The wild incident unfolded on Sunday in Velda Village Hills, located in St. Louis County.

Authorities were alerted about a woman behaving erratically while possibly under the influence of unknown substances, KMOV reports.

“She just asked if she could sit down for a moment to get herself together,” said local resident Scharell Houston.

“Then when she got up she was trying to go into people’s houses and go into people’s cars.”

Officers were attempting to comfort and assess the shoeless woman while waiting for EMS when the situation spiraled out of control.

Body cam footage and video shot by a witness show what transpired.

“Listen you’re not in trouble so just relax,” an officer tells Brown as she squats near a tree.

Suddenly, she can be seen running away, circling around a patrol car, and jumping into the driver’s seat.

Officers frantically pull the door open as the vehicle takes off down the street.

The car slams into a tree before the suspect throws it in reverse and crashes into another tree.

Brown was apprehended at the scene and admitted to a mental health facility for evaluation, STL Today reports.

On Monday, she was charged with felony counts of property damage and stealing a motor vehicle.","[5, 4, 5, 5]","['The article is neutral and does not show indications of leaning towards either right-wing or left-wing ideologies.

infowars,Police,"Democrat Arizona gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs looks like a total fool after jumping to conclusions and insinuating her GOP challenger Kari Lake incited someone to vandalize her campaign headquarters.

On Wednesday, the Hobbs campaign issued an official statement revealing its headquarters had been broken into before telling voters “Kari Lake and her allies have been spreading dangerous misinformation and inciting threats against anyone they see fit.”

“The threats against Arizonans attempting to exercise their constitutional rights and their attacks on elected officials are the direct result of a concerted campaign of lies and intimidation. It won’t work,” the Hobbs statement added.

The Drudge Report ran a headline reading, “Hobbs Blasts Kari Lake for ‘Inciting Threats’ After Campaign HQ Burglarized…”

On Thursday, CNN reporter Kate Sullivan asked Kari Lake about the Hobbs campaign headquarters robbery and if she had a response to the Hobbs team insinuating she was responsible.

“That is absolutely absurd,” Lake answered. “And, are you guys buying that? Are you really buying that? Because this sounds like a Jussie Smollet part two. So, you’re going to drag the American people through something like this?”

She continued, “Obviously, you don’t want to cover the real story today, which we are up eleven percent in the polls and you want to distract the people with an old story. I can’t believe she would blame my amazing people or blame me for something like that. I don’t even know where her campaign office is, I’m assuming it’s in a basement somewhere because that’s where she’s been campaigning.”

Later on Thursday, Phoenix police announced the arrest of 36-year-old illegal alien Daniel Mota Dos Reis in connection with the Hobbs campaign headquarters break-in.

Dos Reis was recognized by an officer viewing security camera footage of the Hobbs HQ theft because the suspect was arrested previously that same day for a different burglary.

The situation is ironic on many levels, with one being that the man is illegal and Kari Lake is strong and outspoken about strengthening the border while Hobbs is weak on immigration.

It’s also ironic because the homeless illegal immigrant was released from police custody hours after committing a separate crime thanks to soft-on-crime Democrat policies like the ones supported by Hobbs.

Lastly, in the most shocking example of irony, the suspect allegedly describes himself on Facebook as a pro-mask “Democrat,” according to Western Journal.

Dos Reis was re-arrested and booked on one count of third-degree burglary in relation to the Hobbs campaign HQ incident.

latimes,Abortion,"Former President Trump — who picked many of his party’s candidates and demanded fealty from them throughout the 2022 midterm campaign — was likely an albatross for the GOP Tuesday night, limiting Republicans’ gains in a midterm election the party expected to dominate.

But if recent history is any guide, Trump’s not going anywhere. The once and likely future presidential candidate is unpopular, but he continues to exercise outsized sway over the Republican base, and could hamstring the party for the next two years and beyond.

As vote-counting continued Wednesday morning, Republicans still had a chance to win both chambers of Congress.

Republicans, though in position to take the House, were sweating it out Wednesday and would need to hold their narrow leads in many of the remaining races to eke out a narrow win. Races in California, where Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has focused attention, could prove decisive.

Paradoxically, a small majority for Republicans would likely give Trump more leverage in Congress, as McCarthy would have to depend on continued support from Trump acolytes such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to maintain power.

Republican Sen. Ron Johnson was declared the winner in Wisconsin just before noon Central time, giving Republicans a 49-48 lead with races in Georgia, Arizona and Nevada yet to be decided. With neither candidate in Georgia winning more than 50% of the vote, the race will go to a Dec. 6 runoff like the one that decided Senate control in 2020. A 50-50 split in the Senate would give Democrats control with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tie-breaking vote.

The close races for control of Congress defy history. The party that holds the White House usually absorbs big midterm election losses. President Biden’s low approval in polls, fueled by persistent inflation, made sizable Republican gains even more likely, at least on paper.

“Definitely not a Republican wave, that’s for darn sure,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said Tuesday night on NBC as he predicted a narrow win for Republicans in the Senate.

The combination of Trump’s low popularity, the generally weak general-election performance of the candidates he endorsed, the aftermath of the Jan. 6 insurrection that he inspired and the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the right to an abortion this year appear to have drawn Democrats closer than expected. Exit polls conducted by media organizations showed two-thirds of independent voters hold an unfavorable view of the former president.

The latest blow to Republicans: Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a top target in the swing state of Michigan, was declared the winner overnight.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, another Democrat, also won her race, defeating Trump-backed candidate Tudor Dixon.

The Michigan results highlight one of the Republican Party’s biggest disappointments. Trump attacked Whitmer relentlessly. Michigan was a key part of the 2016 coalition that propelled Trump’s surprising victory over Hillary Clinton. The state’s historic ties to manufacturing and large population of white working-class voters gave the party hope that the state would trend red as the GOP moved further toward Trump’s brand of populism aimed at capturing economic and cultural anxiety.

But Biden won the state back in 2020, stanching the party’s losses in the upper Midwest.

Michigan voters also approved the most high-profile ballot measure to protect abortion rights, and voters in Kentucky rejected an antiabortion measure that would have added language to the state constitution.

National exit polls this year showed inflation was a top concern among voters. But abortion ranked second. That, and the relative weakness of Trump-backed candidates, helped Democrats stay in the fight.

Many voters appeared willing to swallow their disappointment with Biden. An NBC exit poll showed Democrats narrowly winning — 49% to 45% — among voters who “somewhat disapprove” of Biden’s performance.

The Republicans’ loss of a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, another northern industrial state, could prove the most consequential if Democrats keep the chamber. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman defeated Dr. Mehmet Oz, a television doctor and first-time candidate backed by Trump. Fetterman, still recovering from the effects of a stroke, painted the untested Oz as an elite carpetbagger.

Many of the gubernatorial candidates Trump backed also lost or were in danger of losing as of Wednesday morning.

An exception was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who won reelection in a landslide that permeated races throughout the state. Republicans also performed well in Iowa — winning or leading in almost every major race — while making gains in blue New York, where they appeared likely to win four Democratic-held House seats. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a New York Democrat who led his party’s efforts to keep the House, conceded his own race Wednesday morning to Mike Lawler, a Republican state assemblyman.

DeSantis is seen as Trump’s biggest threat for the 2024 presidential nomination. But even if party leaders prefer DeSantis, Trump has said he will run again. Opinion polls, at least for now, show him as the prohibitive favorite to capture the party’s nomination.

Jason Miller, an advisor to Trump, told the BBC Wednesday morning that he was urging Trump to push back an announcement that he would run again from next week — as he has been teasing — to December, to avoid distracting from a potential Senate runoff in Georgia. But Miller said he remained 100% certain that Trump would run.

“Many of the people who are championing Ron DeSantis for president are the same people who were skeptical of President Trump ever since he came down the escalator in 2015,” Miller said, recalling Trump’s improbable 2016 announcement.

Miller predicted that Trump would “have his hands full” but ultimately win the nomination again.","[6, 8, 7, 9]","['The article provides a critical view of Former President Trump\'s influence and role in the 2022 midterm elections, suggesting possible complications for the Republican party due to his continued involvement.

latimes,Abortion,"Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Friday that immediately protects abortion providers in California from liability when caring for patients traveling from areas where the procedure is now banned or access is narrowed.

Assembly Bill 1666 by Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda) will protect providers and patients in California from civil liability judgements based on claims made in antiabortion states. It further cements the state’s efforts to be a “beacon of hope” in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe vs. Wade.

Newsom said the law will push back against Republican states that allow private lawsuits against abortion providers and patients. Last year, Texas passed a law that allows private citizens to sue anyone who “aids or abets” an abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“We will in no way shape or form, support, enable, investigate, resource, any of those activities or energies,” Newsom said, adding that the new law is part of a larger package of more than a dozen bills aimed at providing “true sanctuary” for those seeking or providing abortions in the state.

California has been preparing for months for the likelihood that thousands of people would travel to the state from areas of the country where bans are resurrected for the first time since 1973. Various bills and budget proposals are in the works, calling for millions to be set aside for abortion services for the uninsured, workforce programs to increase the number of providers and to assist patients with the cost of traveling from other states.

The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports reproductive health and abortion rights, said 26 states will ban all, or nearly all, abortions now that the landmark case has been overturned.

UCLA’s Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy released a report this month estimating that 8,000 to 16,000 more people will travel to California each year for abortion care. That includes up to 9,400 more people from antiabortion states seeking care in Los Angeles County alone, according to the report.

California law grants anyone of reproductive age “the fundamental right to choose to bear a child or to choose and to obtain an abortion.” That includes minors, who under state law can consent to an abortion without their parents’ knowledge.

The state allows a woman to have an abortion until the point that a physician determines “there is a reasonable likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures” or if the procedure is necessary in order to “protect the life or health of the woman.”

State law does not stipulate the exact point in a pregnancy when viability occurs, instead allowing a physician to make that determination based on “good-faith medical judgment.” In most cases, doctors have considered a fetus viable at 24 weeks.

California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said the state will ensure that patients are provided the reproductive care they need, no matter where they live.

“You have the right to an abortion here,” Bonta said. “You have the right to an abortion before viability without a reason. You have the right to an abortion after viability to protect your life or your health. You have the right to obtain an abortion without parental consent. I will not back down from defending these rights, expanding them and keeping our clinics accessible and safe, because in California, we refuse to turn back the clock and let radical ideologies exert control over your body.”","[7, 6, 7, 7]","['This article shows a progressive stance towards reproductive rights issues, specifically focusing on abortion rights.

Rejection of ""radical ideologies"" controlling one\'s body aligns with a liberal perspective opposing conservative-leaning ideologies of restricting abortion. \n\nIn summary, the article\'s language and focus on protecting and even expanding women\'s access to abortion aligns strongly with liberal ideology, demonstrating deep support for reproductive rights and a strong opposition to anti-abortion or restrictive measures.', 'The rhetorical analysis of this article reveals a narrative that is supportive of Governor Gavin Newsom, abortion providers, and reproductive rights, which typically inclines towards a left-wing or liberal perspective.\n\n1. ""Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill Friday that immediately protects abortion providers in California from liability when caring for patients traveling from areas where the procedure is now banned or access is narrowed.""\n   - The strong emphasis on Newsom\'s legislative decision to protect abortion providers represents an ideological perspective supportive of abortion rights and access, often associated with left-wing ideals.\n\n2. ""Assembly Bill 1666...will protect providers and patients in California from civil liability judgements based on claims made in anti-abortion states.""\n   - By spotlighting a bill that safeguards providers and patients from liability associated with anti-abortion states, the article implies a stance critical of such restrictions. This view aligns with left-wing political ideologies that prioritize reproductive freedom.\n\n3. ""Newsom said the law will push back against Republican states that allow private lawsuits against abortion providers and patients.""\n   - The article directly quotes Newsom\'s assertive stance against laws in Republican states. This adversarial referential framing towards Republican policies indicates a political leaning that aligns with liberal principles.\n\n4. ""California has been preparing for months for the likelihood...Various bills and budget proposals are in the works...to increase the number of providers and to assist patients with the cost of traveling from other states.""\n   - Mentioning California\'s efforts to solidify abortion rights underlines a pro-choice viewpoint. By emphasizing this proactive approach, the article\'s narrative aligns with left-leaning beliefs that support comprehensive reproductive care.\n\n5. ""The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports reproductive health and abortion rights, said 26 states will ban all, or nearly all, abortions...\'""\n   - Quoting the Guttmacher Institute’s concerns lends credibility to a narrative that defends abortion rights, a perspective typically associated with liberal ideologies.\n\n6. ""California law grants anyone of reproductive age \'the fundamental right to choose to bear a child or to choose and to obtain an abortion.\' That includes minors, who under state law can consent to an abortion without their parents’ knowledge.""\n   - Highlighting these aspects of California law supports a viewpoint favoring unrestricted access to abortions, an issue central to liberal convictions.\n\n7. ""California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta said the state will ensure that patients are provided the reproductive care they need, no matter where they live.""\n   - The article’s ending quote stresses the resolve to uphold reproductive rights irrespective of geographical constraints, signaling alignment with left-wing ideologies.\n\nIn conclusion, the repeated defense of abortion rights and providers, along with pointed criticism of Republican anti-abortion laws, aligns the ideological perspective presented in this article with a left-wing stance.']",6.75,0.5,0.5
latimes,COVID,"Eleven competitive congressional races in California that could end up determining the balance of power in the House were still too close to call Wednesday.

Congressional campaigns on both sides of the aisle expressed cautious optimism as election officials continue tallying votes, a process that could take weeks.

With the prospect of the House majority on the line, the entire nation may be kept in suspense because of California’s notoriously plodding count — a scenario few expected in the lead-up to election day.

“I guess I’m surprised that it’s kind of coming down to California,” said Paul Mitchell, vice president of the political data analysis firm PDI. “I expected the Republicans to pick up 10 to 12 seats in the House, and that’s before they even got to California.”

In the 41st Congressional District, Democrat Will Rollins was ahead of Rep. Ken Calvert — the longest serving GOP member of California’s congressional delegation — by more than 7,500 votes, with just 37% of the ballots counted as of Wednesday.

Calvert’s past opposition to gay rights may have hurt him among the Coachella Valley’s large LGBTQ community, said Mitchell, which could be a reason why the early results trended toward Rollins, who is gay.

Rollins remains confident, saying in an interview with The Times that “we feel like we’re going to win this one.”

“There’s still a long way to go and we know it’s going to be close, but this is a pretty powerful lead,” he said.

Calvert’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

On Tuesday, chatter of an impending national “red wave” could be heard across the Orange County nightclub where GOP congressional hopeful Scott Baugh and others gathered to await election results.

The mood in the packed club dampened when the results began rolling in, but Baugh, who is challenging Democratic Rep. Katie Porter to represent the 47th Congressional District in Orange County, remained confident.

“Early returns in California as you know always favor the Democrats. How many of you voted on election day?” he asked the crowd as hands shot up. “You’re going to reverse what the results are right now and you’re going to put us in the lead by midnight.”

At midnight, Baugh was trailing Porter by fewer than 1,000 votes. Less than a day later, Porter’s lead had grown slightly to roughly 1,500 votes.

On Wednesday, the mood in Porter’s camp was one of cautious optimism. In 2018, it took 11 days for the race between Porter and Republican Mimi Walters to be called.

“There are still tens of thousands of ballots left to be counted, and our campaign respects Orange County voters and will wait patiently for the results,” said campaign spokesperson Lindsay Reilly.

The popularity of mail-in ballots means that results can frequently take longer in many states, including California, than voters typically expect, said Paul Gronke, a professor of political science and director of the Elections and Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, Ore.

“It’s going to make it particularly difficult this year with results coming in at different rates, and it’s going to open up a window for people to charge malfeasance,” he said.

Still, he added, just because the vote is taking longer to count doesn’t mean there’s something wrong.

In the Central Valley’s 22nd district, Republican Rep. David Valadao was ahead of Democratic Assemblyman Rudy Salas by about 3,300 votes with just over a third of the vote counted.

In 2018, publications across the state declared Valadao the winner in his bid for reelection against his Democratic challenger. However, ballot counting continued through the rest of November and Valadao conceded the race in early December.

Valadao acknowledged his campaign “always knew this race was going to be tight,” but he’s hopeful about early returns. Salas said he’s waiting patiently for votes to be counted.

The variables and caveats in the Golden State’s midterm races are many, which makes predictions difficult. The upending of traditional voting methods during the pandemic, uncertainty about the state of democracy and even wet weather on election day could be factors.

Heavy rain over the weekend and on election day might have spurred some voters to mail in ballots at the last minute rather than brave the elements to vote in person, Mitchell said.

Recently, more Republicans have been voting in person on election day because conspiracy theories spread by former President Trump and others have made them distrustful of mail ballots. And since the pandemic, more Democrats have turned to vote by mail. Historically, it was the other way around.

The uncertainty and norm-busting is enough to make Mitchell throw up his hands.

“It’s all over the place,” he said. “We don’t know who voted, and at what magnitude.”","[7, 8, 5, 8]","['The given article primarily provides analytical commentary on the electoral outcomes of California\'s congressional races, portraying a neutral-leaning perspective with slight implications of left-wing leanings.\n\n1.

latimes,COVID,"Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday declared a state of emergency in California over the spread of the monkeypox virus in order to “bolster the state’s vaccination efforts.”

“California is working urgently across all levels of government to slow the spread of monkeypox, leveraging our robust testing, contact tracing and community partnerships strengthened during the pandemic to ensure that those most at risk are our focus for vaccines, treatment and outreach,” Newsom said in statement.

Monkeypox is a rare disease similar to smallpox, though usually milder. It is largely spreading among men who have sex with men as well as transgender and nonbinary people, though health officials warn that anyone can contract the virus through direct contact with infectious sores, scabs or body fluids or by touching clothing and bedding used by a person with the virus.

Nearly 800 cases have been confirmed in California, according to the California Department of Public Health’s most recent data as of Thursday. The state reported that 98.3% of those cases were confirmed in men, the majority of whom identify as part of the LGBTQ community.

The proclamation makes it easier for the state to coordinate its response to the outbreak by ordering all state agencies to follow the direction of the Office of Emergency Services and the California Department of Public Health. The order also boosts vaccination efforts by allowing EMS workers to administer vaccines, which remain in short supply.

Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) and several other state lawmakers sent a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Monday calling for an emergency budget appropriation of $38.5 million to support local monkeypox testing, vaccination, treatment and outreach for the first 90 days of the outbreak.

“The monkeypox outbreak is an emergency, and we need to use every tool we have to control it,” Wiener said in a statement after Newsom’s emergency declaration.

Newsom’s office said California has distributed more than 25,000 doses of the vaccine out of a total of 61,000 doses received to date. That total does not include a separate allocation the federal government directed to Los Angeles County.

The governor’s order said the state is “distributing its limited supply of the vaccine to local health jurisdictions based on a formula that considers current monkeypox cases and number of high-risk individuals.”

Those eligible for the vaccine in L.A. County include anyone who had direct contact with someone with monkeypox or attended a high-exposure event. Also eligible under the county’s guidelines are gay and bisexual men and transgender people who visited a commercial sex venue or other venue where they had anonymous sex or sex with multiple partners in the last three weeks, or who were diagnosed with gonorrhea or early syphilis within the last 12 months or are taking HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis medicine.

The governor’s office said more than 30 facilities and providers across the state are offering treatment for monkeypox, though access to the antiviral prescription drug tecovirimat is also limited.

“We’ll continue to work with the federal government to secure more vaccines, raise awareness about reducing risk, and stand with the LGBTQ community fighting stigmatization,” Newsom said.

Those infected by the virus initially have a fever, aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. Later they develop a rash, usually starting on the face and then spreading, turning into pus-filled sores before healing.

Monkeypox illnesses typically resolve within two to four weeks but can cause severe pain, hospitalization, long-term symptoms and, in rare cases, death.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger urged the county to “draw down all the support available to accelerate the distribution of vaccines and resources to those at risk and suffering from this terrible disease” in response to the governor’s order.

“I will work to ensure we’re doing so quickly and efficiently,” Barger said in a statement. “We don’t have any time to waste.”

An investigation into the first case of monkeypox in California in a person who traveled abroad began on May 21 and was confirmed on May 25.

Under the 1970 California Emergency Services Act, the governor has broad authority to respond during a state of emergency. The governor can “make, amend, and rescind” state regulations and suspend state statutes and has the power to redirect state funds to help in an emergency — even funds appropriated by the California Legislature for an entirely different purpose.

The California Supreme Court in 2021 upheld an appeals court ruling that affirmed Newsom’s emergency powers. Two state Republican lawmakers had challenged Newsom’s power after he declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing he had no right to issue an executive order requiring ballots to be mailed to the state’s 22 million registered voters before the Nov. 3, 2020, election.

The high court ruled the law was constitutional because it required the governor to terminate a declared state of emergency as soon as possible and also allows the Legislature to end it by passing a joint resolution.","[7, 5, 4, 6]","['The language and reportage of this article lean towards a liberal perspective.

latimes,Climate Change,"If you’ve been yearning for a preview of the battle for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, the place to be last weekend was Las Vegas, where the Republican Jewish Coalition held what some attendees cheekily called a “kosher cattle call” for potential candidates.

Former Vice President Mike Pence was there. So were former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo. Former President Trump appeared by video — only a few days before dining with two of the country’s best-known antisemites.

The biggest buzz of the weekend, though, was attached to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the rising 44-year-old star of the conservative firmament, fresh from a landslide reelection.

Around the country, DeSantis noted, many Republicans fell short in this year’s midterm elections. Florida, he said, offered “a blueprint for success.”

DeSantis isn’t running for president yet, at least not officially. He has told supporters to “chill out” until Florida’s legislative session ends in May.

But the presence of so many non-candidates at a Las Vegas cattle call showed that the contest is already underway; that Trump, the only declared candidate, isn’t getting much deference from the party he once led; and that, at least for the moment, DeSantis appears to be the challenger most likely to take the former president down.

Polls don’t mean much at this early stage. At this point ahead of the 2016 GOP race, the top contenders in polls were former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.

What the polls can say, however, is that most Republican voters have focused on three names: Trump, DeSantis and Pence. Six months ago, most of them didn’t know who DeSantis was.

“It’s too early to call anyone a front-runner,” said Alex Conant, a strategist for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the 2016 campaign. “But you’d rather be Ron DeSantis than anyone else in the field. He’s made as good a first impression on Republican voters as anyone in decades.”

DeSantis has several things going for him, including the adulation of Fox News, which treats him as a front-runner and has begun casting Trump as yesterday’s man.

DeSantis has used that attention to build a national following as a conservative champion in a multifront culture war on not only traditional GOP issues like abortion and immigration but newer targets like antiracism education in public schools (pilloried by DeSantis and others as “critical race theory”), transgender surgery for minors (DeSantis wants to outlaw it) and a crusade against what he calls “woke banks.”

The governor has proposed legislation to prohibit banks from discriminating against customers for their religious, political or social beliefs. (Conservative activists are convinced that banks run by liberals won’t lend to right-wing organizations.)

His unifying theme is opposition to what he sees as a liberal power elite: not only Democratic politicians but “globalist” big businesses, big tech and “leftist media.”

“We are not afraid to buck the discredited ruling class,” he said in a recent speech. “This is an agenda that is trying to render the conservative half of the country second-class citizens.”

This is Trumpism 2.0: a pugnacious, populist conservatism rooted in resentment but updated, more disciplined and free of the self-absorption of Trump’s version.

“He’s Trump without the craziness,” said Republican pollster Whit Ayres.

Whether that’s enough to carry DeSantis to the nomination remains to be seen.

“There’s a lot we don’t know yet,” one GOP strategist told me. “He hasn’t really been tested on a national stage. We don’t know how he’ll react to tough opposition. We don’t know how he’ll perform in debates. The Mike Tyson rule applies: Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”

And being a front-runner may not be as cushy as it seems. Other candidates are more likely to see you as a target, since you block their way to the top.

“There’s a danger of cannibalism,” Conant said. “In 2016, a lot of other candidates went after Rubio from Day One. Will they start going after DeSantis this time?”

Unlike 2016, in the coming round of Republican primaries no one is likely to underestimate the former president or be surprised by his bulldozer tactics. With their party’s future in their hands, would-be nominees will face a choice.

They can repeat the pattern of 2016, when Trump’s rivals avoided attacking him and savaged one another instead.

Or they can take a page from the Democrats of 2020, who coalesced around Joe Biden once it became clear that their race was headed for a showdown between him and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Biden, who had nearly been counted out of the race a month earlier, is in the White House today. That’s a lesson Republican contenders may want to heed.","[6, 6, 8, 7]","['The article presents a balanced narrative on the potential 2024 Republican presidential nomination, with relatively neutral language and objective reporting of events and potential candidate attributes.

latimes,Climate Change,"Last fall, after state and local governments flushed more than $200 million down the toilet for a failed effort to chase Gov. Gavin Newsom from office, there was all sorts of talk about reforming California’s recall process.

Lawmakers held forth, hearings took place, academics weighed in and the state’s independent oversight commission gave the Legislature recommendations.

Then nothing much happened.

“Most of it, I think, is because the average legislator — and we’re the ones who are going to put this on the ballot through a constitutional amendment — isn’t going to be recalled,” said state Sen. Josh Newman, a Fullerton Democrat who was recalled in 2018 before winning back his seat in 2020. “So it doesn’t have the same level of urgency, especially as time goes by.”

Lawmakers also respond to what they’re hearing, or not, from the people they represent. And, let’s face it, voters dealing with soaring inflation, a pandemic, the skyrocketing cost of gas and fears of a recession don’t consider tinkering with California’s recall rules a matter of particular urgency.

But the system needs to be fixed, or soon enough California could face another distracting and expensive attempt to subvert the election process.

How pointless was the attempted recall of Newsom? Essentially, it amounted to a re-running of the 2018 gubernatorial election, which the Democrat won with 61.9% support. The same share, 61.9%, voted against his removal.

The way it now works, a recall election is conducted in two parts. Voters are asked whether a lawmaker should be removed, and if so, who should replace them. That second question allows the top vote-getter to take office even if they fall well short of majority support — which is why outnumbered Republicans found it so enticing to take on the governor.

The presence of that second question allows a political minority to try “to get out of a special election what you obviously couldn’t get out of a normal election,” said Newman, who has introduced legislation to change things so only one question appears on the ballot — a straight up-or-down vote on the recall.

“We [would] still have the option of removing a corrupt or malfeasant elected official,” said Newman, who was ousted after voting to raise gas taxes and vehicle fees. (Though really it was about Republicans denying Democrats their supermajority in the state Senate.) “But we’ve removed the kind of perverse incentive that has led to all this partisan warfare.”

Under his legislation, if a governor were ousted during the first two years of his or her term, the lieutenant governor would take over until a special election to choose a replacement. If the governor had only two years left to serve, the lieutenant governor would finish the term.

The proposal leaves a lot of unsolved problems, but as Newman suggested, change is hard. He once hoped to put his reform measure before voters in November, but legislative inertia makes that extremely unlikely. His goal now is 2024.

The recall is a hand-me-down from the progressive era, one of the tools given citizens to hold their elected leaders accountable. Repeated polls have shown that Californians, by an overwhelming margin, like holding that bludgeon in their hand. (In the last few months, voters in San Francisco booted their district attorney and three members of their school board.)

But the 20th century reform has proven ripe for 21st century abuse, and the failed attempt by out-of-power Republicans to drive Newsom from office — nine months before he was to face voters anyway — highlighted several of its flaws.

Of 19 states that allow their governor to be recalled, California is by far the most permissive, with an exceedingly low signature requirement. And there’s no prerequisite — no requirement for evidence of malfeasance, corruption or criminality — to try to force an incumbent from office.

In the whole history of this country, there have been just four gubernatorial recall elections. Half those occurred in California within the last two decades, which seems like no coincidence given the ease of forcing a vote, the bounty paid to collect signatures and the backdrop of increasingly stark political polarization.

California’s independent oversight agency, the Little Hoover Commission, has recommended several changes. (And here things get a bit wonky, which is another reason that reform efforts appear to have stalled. Process doesn’t inspire great passion, which is one reason you don’t see masses of demonstrators descending on Sacramento chanting, “No bifurcated ballots!”)

One proposal calls for increasing the signature requirement from 12% of the vote in the prior gubernatorial election to 10% of the state’s registered voters, thereby raising the threshold to force a recall. Another would prohibit recalls undertaken during the first 90 days and last six months of an officeholder’s term.

Newman said various remedies are worth discussing, but warned that “there’s a risk of trying to do too much.”

“The more complicated you make it,” he said, “the easier it is for people to obfuscate” the issue and keep anything from getting done.

Still, a revamp of the recall is badly needed, even if it may not be the most pressing issue of the moment. It’s important that our elections have integrity, and that people respect the outcomes and don’t try to overturn them simply because they’re unhappy with the results.

Down that road lies chaos and, at the extreme end, Jan. 6, 2021.

latimes,Economy,"The recent spike in gasoline prices took the greatest financial toll on Black and Latino Californians, though more than half of all adults in the state reported suffering at least moderate economic hardship, according to a new poll by the Public Policy Institute of California.

Californians living in the Inland Empire and Central Valley, where distant commutes or long drives for work and daily chores are commonplace, also felt a far greater pinch due to steep prices at the pump compared with those living in the state’s densely populated urban landscapes, especially the San Francisco Bay Area.

State Republicans have used high gas prices, which have been on the decline since peaking in the late spring and early summer, to attack Gov. Gavin Newsom and the California Legislature’s Democratic leadership for refusing to temporarily suspend the state’s highest-in-the-nation gas tax.

But neither Newsom nor Democratic lawmakers appear to have suffered politically due to the high gas prices or other economic turbulence around the nation, the poll showed.

The survey found that nearly 60% of adults in the state approved of the way Newsom has handled the issue of jobs and the economy, while just under 40% disapproved.

The California Legislature, where Democrats hold supermajorities in both the Senate and Assembly, received similar marks: 55% of adults approved of their actions while 42% disapproved.

Mark Baldassare, the institute’s president and chief executive, called those approval numbers “incredible” given that the poll also showed that 70% of adults in the state felt that bad times were ahead for the California economy in the next 12 months. Baldassare said the brunt of voter anger over the rise in inflation and other economic concerns has been more focused on President Biden and Congress.

“On inflation, people are not only feeling it but they’re upset,” Baldassare said. “People are feeling that things are just out of control ... and expect government to have a handle on that so that they don’t have to worry about it.”

Perhaps helping Newsom and other Democrat leaders at the Capitol was a spending plan the governor signed in June that will provide payments to 17.5 million California taxpayers to lessen the impact of high fuel prices and the cost of living.

The plan provides payments on a sliding scale based on income. The lowest income bracket is eligible for $350 per tax filer and another $350 for those who claim at least one dependent. Respective payments drop to $250 for the middle-income level and $200 for the highest.

Gas prices have been one of the major drivers of rising inflation nationwide, and the effect has been especially acute in California, which is topped only by Texas when it comes to gasoline consumption.

One in four Latino adults in California said high gas prices caused severe financial hardship, and 49% reported moderate hardship, the poll found. Among Black adults, 23% reported severe financial hardship and 35% moderate. Severe hardship also was felt among 15% of white and 12% of Asian American adults. Moderate hardship was reported by 36% of white and 20% of Asian American adults, according to the poll.

latimes,Economy,"The Biden administration plans to exclude Cuba from the upcoming Summit of the Americas, a major global meeting to be held in Los Angeles in June that typically welcomes all governments in the Western Hemisphere, a senior U.S. official told The Times.

The summit, which is held every three or four years, is being convened in the United States for the first time since its 1994 inaugural session in Miami. Los Angeles was chosen as the venue earlier this year.

The administration’s refusal to invite Cuba is likely to anger several other Latin American countries as President Biden and the State Department attempt to repair damaged relations in the region.

“We expect the democratic nations of our hemisphere to gather for a conversation,” Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere, said in an interview, referring to the summit.

Cuba, he said, is decidedly not part of that group, especially after demonstrations in July in which Cubans demanded political and economic freedoms. Many people were arrested and at least one died. In addition, Washington has opposed Russian influence in communist-ruled Cuba, its lack of free speech and its human rights record.

Numerous advocates who support improved relations with Cuba — including some in Congress — had hoped the Biden administration would reopen diplomatic, political and trade ties with the island that were frozen under President Trump. Trump reversed a historic opening initiated by President Obama, who sought to end a half-century of Cold War hostilities.

However, President Biden has done little to roll back Trump’s rebukes of Cuba, which included adding the country to a U.S. government list of state sponsors of terrorism. And the administration is only slowly reestablishing U.S. consular services in Havana that would help Cubans obtain visas for legal travel.

In addition, a U.S. policy on remittances, money that people, including Cuban Americans, can send to island residents, remains “under review,” strangling a lifeline for many. Flights by American carriers, trips by U.S. tourists and cultural exchanges also remain problematic without clearer guidelines from the administration.

Meanwhile, a tough economic embargo on the island that dates to the Eisenhower administration remains in place.

The hard line on Cuba appears to have carried over to the Summit of the Americas.

For many summits after the inaugural session, all held in Latin America or the Caribbean, Cuba has not been invited or has declined an invitation.

More recently, however, its government began to participate, invited despite it engaging in practices that other members of the region’s diplomatic bodies, such as the Organization of American States, have harshly condemned.

The U.S. decision, which has not been formally announced and will ultimately be made by Biden, is already attracting criticism in the region.

In addition to Cuba voicing opposition to the move, officials in Mexico, a key U.S. ally, indicated they were not pleased. In a phone call on April 29, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador urged Biden to invite to the summit all the countries of the Western Hemisphere, “without excluding anyone.”

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard held closed-door meetings with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken on Tuesday in Washington. Ebrard said later at a news conference at the Mexican Embassy that he asked Blinken to reconsider denying invitations to Cuba, as well as to Nicaragua and Venezuela, which are also expected to be excluded. Ebrard said he came away without a definitive answer.

On April 11, 2015, on the sidelines of a Summit of the Americas in Panama, Obama met and shook hands with then-President Raul Castro of Cuba, the first contact between leaders of the two countries in decades. Obama said at the time that he believed the two countries could disagree in “the spirit of respect and civility” and that the time was coming “to turn the page.”

Within months, the two revived diplomatic ties between their countries, reopened various economic and trade arrangements, and Obama made a historic trip to Havana.

Trump reversed those actions, ending travel and freezing remittances and reversing diplomatic overtures. And Biden has not chosen to reinstate Obama’s diplomatic approach.

For the Summit of the Americas, it is also unlikely that the U.S. will invite Nicaragua, where President Daniel Ortega has conducted what the U.S. and many other nations and democracy groups call a sham election that gave him yet another term in office.

And Venezuela is always the skunk at the picnic, with President Nicolas Maduro shunned at most international gatherings. The question is whether Biden will invite Juan Guaidó, a Venezuelan opposition leader whom the U.S. government has recognized as the rightful leader of the country despite little domestic support.

Yet some questionable democracies will be invited because of overriding ties they have with the United States, Nichols and other officials said.

El Salvador, for example, has such long-standing ties with the U.S., dating to its civil war in the 1980s — in which the Reagan administration backed the Salvadoran government and numerous U.S. church and civil rights groups supported the opposition — that the country should not be excluded, Nichols said.

“We obviously have deep and long-standing ties with El Salvador and their millions of Salvadorans in the United States,” Nichols said, noting that ties were particularly strong to Southern California.

“We have very substantial differences with President [Nayib] Bukele on a number of issues, particularly related to democracy, the separation of powers and transparency, [yet] I believe that it will be important for El Salvador to participate,” Nichols said, referring to recent actions by Bukele to erode judicial independence and silence dissent and journalists critical of his administration.

The summit will be a forum to discuss immigration, trade, climate change and ways to reinforce democracy, among other topics. Nichols said it was likely the region’s leaders will produce a “Los Angeles declaration” on promoting “safe, humane orderly migration” and ensuring that migrants “can be protected where they are, and there are opportunities for them to remain in place.”","[7, 7, 9, 8]","['The article arguably has a neutral to left-leaning point of view, offering critique of decisions made both by Biden and Trump administrations and highlighting potential impacts of recent policies.

latimes,Election,"Alexandra Pelosi was having one of those days.

She’s still raw from the hammer attack on her father by a QAnon crazy. “I have not slept through the night since,” Pelosi confessed.

A recent morning found her whipping up a Betty Crocker birthday cake, readying her New York apartment for an invasion of teenage girls and vacuuming the broken glass from a toppled Christmas tree, all while fending off a sister demanding to know why that was included in the new documentary she produced on their famous mother.

The trailer had just come out.

“I’m doing PR management in my own family,” a harried Pelosi said, as a cheery “Happy Birthday” banner — hung in honor of her 15-year-old — did its best to brighten things.

Pelosi, the youngest of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s five children, is a filmmaker who launched her career with the cheeky documentary “Journeys with George,” a verite look at the 2000 presidential campaign of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. She spent months living on the campaign charter, as a camcorder-toting producer for NBC News. Pelosi has since created more than a dozen documentaries, on such topics as child poverty, big money in politics and the effects of the tech boom on San Francisco, where she was born and raised.

With a camera as her constant companion — and occasional irritant to those around her — Pelosi filmed thousands of hours of her mother, in public settings and private moments, doing housework and the work of House speaker. The finished product begins airing Tuesday on HBO.

“This is my view and it’s my movie,” Pelosi said, noting some in her family might have preferred a more worshipful look at their path-breaking parent. She said the speaker — whom she repeatedly referred to, with professional distance, as “Nancy Pelosi” — wasn’t a particularly cooperative subject.

“If I tried to ask her a question, she never plays ball with me,” Pelosi said. “She never gave me permission to film. She always said, ‘Why are you filming all this?’ She never understood. So it wasn’t authorized, she never signed a release... She saw the trailer, she told me, ‘You should take out this, this and this.’

“I go, ‘Mom, the trailer’s on YouTube,’” Pelosi said in the tone of exasperated offspring the world over.

Not, she noted, that the speaker had any say in the matter.

At 52, Pelosi has her mother’s hummingbird energy, traces of the speaker’s husky voice and a speeding-subway-train delivery that’s more New York than California. She spoke via Zoom, wearing a purple turtleneck — her trademark color — with the tumbled Christmas tree and scattered presents just off-camera.

Pelosi described her latest project as a happy accident growing out of a 2018 conversation in the HBO cafeteria with Geof Bartz, a frequent collaborator and the network’s supervising editor for documentaries. She mentioned her extensive catalog of family footage, and Bartz agreed to take a look and see if there was something there.

That November, Democrats took control of the House, and Pelosi was installed for a second history-making go-round as speaker. The documentary’s perspective shifted from a look back on Pelosi’s career to a more contemporaneous account of her battles with then-President Trump, culminating in the Jan. 6 raid on Congress by insurrectionists seeking to overturn the 2020 election.

In October, the House committee investigating the failed coup released snippets of iPhone footage Alexandra Pelosi shot that day, showing lawmakers fleeing for their lives and desperately seeking assistance to quell the riot. At one point, a furious Nancy Pelosi said she wanted to punch Trump, who incited the violence and blithely watched his marauding supporters on TV.

The tinfoil-hat crowd has seized on Alexandra Pelosi’s presence as somehow proving the whole thing — the desecration of the Capitol, the assault on democracy — was staged. No surprise there. She’s prepared, Pelosi said, for that kind of crazy, as well as efforts to embarrass her mother by turning her work into a mockumentary spoofing the life and unflattering times of the speaker.

“I know that Tucker Carlson will pick out, like, the most silly moments and exploit it for his own political purposes,” Pelosi said of the Fox News hatemonger. “And then all of his followers will go online and destroy my film to ensure it doesn’t get taken seriously as a documentary. And that’s fine. I’m a big girl, I’m wearing my big-girl pants, I couldn’t care less.

“What I do care about,” and here she paused for several seconds, “is that I don’t want them to break into my house and attack me in the middle of the night.”

It was no idle thought.

Pelosi, who has been targeted with a steady stream of death threats, lives now with security outside her apartment. Her teenagers have received death threats as well. She described walking down the street with them and being accosted by strangers demanding answers to some of the ludicrous, conspiratorial questions Carlson and his fellow trolls have raised about the attack on her father.

“There’s this very toxic, negative energy circulating around my family,” Pelosi said matter-of-factly, “and we live with it.”

The release of “Pelosi in the House” could have been a triumphant moment, marrying Alexandra Pelosi’s artistic eye with a lifetime’s worth of unparalleled access to one of the most powerful and important women in U.S. history. The documentary — with its chilling images of Jan. 6, its intimate sausage-making look at the legislative process, its charming mother-daughter banter — is genuinely revealing.

But Pelosi isn’t looking for rave reviews, or to send TV ratings through the roof.

latimes,Election,"A federal judge on Wednesday handed an incremental victory to the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection in a case involving California attorney John Eastman.

Eastman, who advised former President Trump on efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, has been fighting to prevent the committee from seeing more than 100 emails involving him.

The judge ruled against Eastman for now, saying the court would review the documents to determine which can be turned over to the panel.

Eastman has emerged as a central figure in the committee’s investigation into Trump’s efforts to subvert the election results.

He wrote two legal memos arguing that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to unilaterally reject electoral votes or delay their counting, which could have opened the door for Republican-led state legislatures to cast their votes for Trump even though more voters cast their ballots for Joe Biden. The advice was disregarded by Pence and roundly denounced by legal experts when it became public last year.

The congressional committee subpoenaed emails sent or received by Eastman from Jan. 4 to Jan. 7, 2021.

Eastman sued to block release of the documents, which are housed on the server of Chapman University in Orange, which was Eastman’s employer at the time. He argued that they’re protected from disclosure by attorney-client privilege and related legal rules.

“After reading the emails, the Court will determine for each document whether any privilege existed, whether that privilege was waived, and whether any exceptions apply,” wrote U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who is based in Santa Ana.

“Ultimately, the Court will issue a written decision including its full analysis and its final determination of which, if any, documents must be disclosed to the Select Committee.”

The committee had argued for the court review of 111 disputed emails in a hearing on Tuesday, which also offered more insight into the panel’s theory of potential criminal charges against Trump, which was first revealed last week in a court filing pertaining to Eastman’s lawsuit.

In that filing, the committee alleged that the emails it was seeking from Eastman could show that Trump broke multiple laws by seeking to block the certification of Biden’s win despite knowing that his claims of fraud were unfounded.

The committee said attorney-client privilege between Eastman and Trump would not apply to evidence demonstrating crime or fraud.

Charles Burnham, an attorney for Eastman, acknowledged in the hearing it was likely the judge would review the documents and tamped down expectations the emails would reveal blatant wrongdoing.

“There’s not going to be an email where anyone involved in the campaign effort says, ‘We’ve got to have some ruffians rush the Capitol if the vice president doesn’t make the decision we want.’ It’s not going to be there,” Burnham said.

“There’s not going to be an email that says, ‘We all know the election had no fraud or illegality, but we’ve got to come up with something.’”

Douglas Letter, counsel for the House select committee, said while they didn’t expect the emails would show such flagrant violations, there was already information that points to fraud or criminal intent.

He cited an email to Pence’s counsel, Greg Jacob, in which Eastman said Trump had been advised there was nothing supporting his allegations of electoral fraud, but “once [Trump] gets something in his head, it’s hard to get him to change course.”

“That’s pretty strong evidence ... that Trump was ignoring all of the very clear evidence because he wanted something different,” Letter said. “He wanted the vice president to do something that was plainly against the Constitution.

Carter, in his order, did not address the committee’s allegations of criminal or fraudulent activity. He said the panel raised sufficient questions about whether Eastman’s emails would be shielded under attorney-client privilege or as work product made in anticipation of a lawsuit.

While the ruling advances the committee’s efforts, Carter noted that “reading the emails does not mean that the Court will ultimately require disclosure.” The order did not specify when it will determine which emails should be turned over to congressional investigators.

The hearing also involved an attorney for Chapman University, where Eastman served as law professor and onetime dean of the law school.

An uproar over Eastman’s involvement with Trump, including his appearance at a pro-Trump rally immediately preceding the insurrection at the Capitol, prompted the professor to retire abruptly one week after Jan. 6.","[8, 7, 7, 5]","['The article presents a neutral and balanced account of a recent court decision involving John Eastman, a lawyer for former President Trump, and the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.

latimes,Immigration,"Acting on an emergency appeal from some Republican-led states, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. issued a temporary order Monday that will preserve — for now — a Trump-era policy that turned away most migrants seeking asylum at the southern border.

The chief justice asked for a response from the Biden administration by the end of the day Tuesday.

It remains unclear whether Roberts or the full Supreme Court will make a decision on the appeal before Wednesday, when the so-called Title 42 rule is set to end.

Tens of thousands of migrants have been moving toward the border with Mexico, believing the rule would expire this week.

The Trump administration adopted the rule in response to the COVID-19 emergency and authorized the government to turn away migrants without giving them an asylum hearing. Title 42 refers to part of a U.S. public health law that allows the government to act during certain emergencies.

The Biden administration had said that as the pandemic eased, the restrictions may no longer be needed.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington set aside the rule, holding that it was no longer justified as a pandemic measure. His decision allowed for an appeal, but it was due to take effect Wednesday.

Arizona Atty. Gen. Mark Brnovich joined with 18 other states and filed an emergency appeal asking Roberts and the Supreme Court to intervene. He said the border states will see a surge of new migrants, and he argued the high court should hear the case first.

“No one reasonably disputes that the failure to grant a stay will cause a crisis of unprecedented proportions at the border,” he wrote. The Department of Homeland Security “estimates that daily illegal crossings may more than double from around 7,000/day to 15,000/day once Title 42 is terminated.”

He also argued that the Biden administration failed to vigorously defend the policy in court.

The White House had no immediate comment Monday.

Roberts said the restrictions would remain in place until the court acts.

In recent months, the Supreme Court has issued similar temporary administrative orders to give the justices a few days to hear from both sides in a case and decide what to do. In several occasions, the court has ultimately turned down an emergency appeal even after the justices put the matter on hold temporarily.","[6, 9, 6, 8]","['The article presents a critique of the Biden administration\'s position towards the Title 42 rule.

latimes,Immigration,"After more than a year of negotiation, settlement talks between the Biden administration and plaintiffs in a lawsuit over temporary protected status fell through on Tuesday, leaving more than 250,000 people at risk of deportation.

The litigation followed concerted actions by the Trump administration to end TPS for the citizens of several countries — El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Haiti, Sudan and Nepal — as part of its efforts to wind down extended use of the protections. TPS is a form of humanitarian relief granted to countries devastated by natural disasters or war and allows beneficiaries to work legally while they remain in the U.S. Created in 1990, the program currently applies to people from 15 countries.

The plaintiffs won temporary relief in 2018 when a federal district judge in San Francisco granted an injunction to block the termination of protections. But in 2020, a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed the order in a 2-1 decision. That hasn’t taken effect because lawyers for the immigrants requested a hearing before the full court, which remains pending.

The Biden administration redesignated temporary protected status for Haiti and Sudan, but has not done so for the four other countries. Those beneficiaries could lose their protections as early as the end of this year, while the Biden administration goes to court to defend the previous administration’s decisions.

As a presidential candidate, however, Joe Biden called President Trump’s decision to rescind TPS “a recipe for disaster,” promising to protect beneficiaries from being returned to unsafe countries. The Homeland Security and Justice departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Emi MacLean, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, said a settlement would have provided safety and security for the TPS holders who have felt vulnerable during the last four years of litigation.

“There is a reason that people are losing faith in the [Biden] administration,” she said. “These actions leave us very concerned about whether they recognize the urgency of this issue and the fact that many lives are on the line because of their unwillingness to act.”

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson declined to comment on pending litigation but said that “current TPS holders from El Salvador, Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras will continue to be protected over the coming months.”

TPS holders and their U.S. citizen children brought the class-action challenge in 2018 alleging government officials had a political agenda in deciding to terminate protections for those countries and were motivated by racism. Trump administration officials countered by saying the program was never intended to provide a long-term reprieve.

Plaintiff Elsy Flores Ayala said she was frustrated that a settlement couldn’t be negotiated. Flores Ayala, 43, her husband and their 24-year-old daughter have had TPS since 2001, a year after they arrived in the U.S. from El Salvador.

El Salvador was first designated for TPS in March 2001 after two earthquakes ravaged the country, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing more than 1 million. Since then, the U.S. government has cited subsequent natural disasters and gang-related insecurity in redesignations. Nearly 200,000 Salvadorans have TPS, many of them in California.

Flores Ayala said she and her family, who live in Washington, depend on the benefits that come with TPS — she works in child care, her husband does maintenance at an apartment building and her daughter is in college. She also worries about what could happen if they lose the deportation protections. Her two youngest children, ages 17 and 21, were born in the U.S. and she fears being separated from them.

“The worry is significant because we don’t know what will happen with us,” she said.

In the pointed ruling in 2018, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen blocked the terminations, saying beneficiaries risked being uprooted from their homes, jobs and communities.

“They face removal to countries to which their children and family members may have little or no ties and which may not be safe,” he wrote. “Those with U.S.-citizen children will be confronted with the dilemma of either bringing their children with them, giving up their children’s lives in the United States (for many, the only lives they know), or being separated from their children.”

The judge, an appointee of President Obama, also cited Trump’s reported comments about Haitian and African immigrants being from “shithole countries,” noting “circumstantial evidence of race being a motivating factor.”

Through the discovery process, lawyers for the immigrants received internal communications from the Homeland Security Department during the time the decisions for terminating TPS were made.

In one instance, then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke wrote in a personal memo in March 2018 that “the TPS program must end for these countries soon. … This conclusion is the result of an America first view of the TPS decision.”

Career diplomats and other experts cautioned at the time that the decisions would result in significant humanitarian and political repercussions, while a Homeland Security official suggested they comb through the conditions in those countries for “positive gems” to justify their arguments that recipients no longer needed legal protections.","[7, 7, 5, 6]","['The article appears to lean towards a left-wing perspective due to its emphasis on the risks and negative impacts to the temporary protected status (TPS) holders following the failure of the Biden administration and plaintiffs to settle.

latimes,Police,"Five leaders of the Oath Keepers, a right-wing militia that played a leading role in storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, went on trial last week in Washington.

The defendants, including Stewart Rhodes, the Yale-educated lawyer who founded the group, were charged with “seditious conspiracy”: plotting to attack the federal government by force to prevent Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election.

Prosecutors said Rhodes and others planned the assault on the Capitol, ordered their troops to bring “zombie killer tomahawks” and other weapons and stockpiled guns in hotels in case the battle escalated.

“We aren’t getting through this without a civil war,” Rhodes told his followers in a text message, according to his indictment.

The trial, the first of several planned for ringleaders of the insurrection, has high stakes.

It’s the highest-profile prosecution so far in the Justice Department’s massive Jan. 6 dragnet.

It’s a rare use of “seditious conspiracy,” the U.S. equivalent of a domestic terrorism law, a charge that dates back to the Civil War. The defendants aren’t accused of committing violent acts but of organizing the squad that did.

And it may have crippled the Oath Keepers, a 13-year-old militia recruited largely from military veterans and law enforcement officers that styled itself as the armed vanguard of the militant right.

“As an organization, the Oath Keepers have lost a lot of steam from this,” said Jon Lewis, a terrorism scholar at George Washington University. “Members have distanced themselves from the leadership. Their brand has become toxic.”

But the prosecutions haven’t put a perceptible dent in the larger phenomenon of right-wing extremism, an ecosystem that includes white supremacists, antigovernment militants and many (but far from all) supporters of former President Trump.

For example, the Proud Boys, another militia whose leader, Enrique Tarrio, and four lieutenants are scheduled to go on trial on similar charges in December. The Proud Boys aren’t shrinking; they appear to be expanding.

“Their leadership has been decimated, but we’ve seen increased activity at a local level,” Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League told me. “They keep adding new chapters ... and their agenda has diversified; they’re showing up at school board meetings and campaigning on LGBTQ issues.”

The militant right has survived Jan. 6 in other forms too.

“It’s a mistake to focus on the militias,” said Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, who has studied the Jan. 6 rioters.

“Almost 90% of the Jan. 6 defendants were not militia members,” he said. “What made Jan. 6 happen was not Oath Keepers or Proud Boys. It was a larger movement that includes many mainstream Trump supporters too. ... The militias are only the most visible part.”

Based on public opinion surveys, about 18 million Americans believe violence is justified to restore Trump to the White House, Pape estimates. Other polls have suggested even larger numbers.

Terrorism scholars say the extremist right is surviving not on the strength of its organizations but on a powerful narrative that appeals to millions of discontented conservatives.

A key part of that narrative is the conviction, fed by Trump and his allies, that Democrats stole the 2020 election and will continue using illegitimate means to prevent conservatives from winning.

Now add one more phenomenon, something scholars call “stochastic terrorism”: seemingly random, lone-wolf attacks inspired by the statements of leaders like Trump.

“We have people with massive megaphones saying we need to do something to stop a corrupt FBI, or an Internal Revenue Service that’s about to send 87,000 armed agents into your homes,” said Lewis, referring to the plan to hire 87,000 IRS employees, most of whom will not be enforcement agents.

“Some people’s response to those messages is not ‘I should go vote.’ It’s ‘I should pick up my gun and head for the nearest federal building.’”

If Republican leaders, including Trump, don’t intend that to be the effect of their words, there’s a simple remedy: They could denounce violence in all its forms — including the violence of Trump supporters on Jan. 6.

Too often, they don’t.

Their political winking at violence makes a difficult task — fighting domestic terrorism while respecting civil liberties — even harder.

“It’s impossible for law enforcement to chase down every right-wing extremist who posts messages on the internet and also owns a firearm,” said Lewis.

All of which means this wave of violent extremism on the right is far from over.

Before the 2020 presidential election, Trump was asked what his message was for the Proud Boys, who even then were issuing threats of violence.

His answer was indulgent. “Stand back and stand by,” he said.

As congressional elections approach next month, and a presidential campaign soon after, they are standing by again.","[7, 7, 7, 8]","['The article offers a comprehensive critique of right-wing extremism, especially involving militias like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.

latimes,Police,"Here’s a look at some of the major cases to be heard by the Supreme Court in the term beginning Oct. 3.

Are Harvard and the University of North Carolina violating the Constitution and federal civil rights law by giving an edge to qualified Black and Latino applicants and by discriminating against Asian American students?

Since the 1978 Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke case, the court has held that colleges and universities may consider race as a “plus factor” for Black and Latino applicants to create a more diverse class.

But the court’s conservatives have long opposed this affirmative action, and they contend the law prohibits consideration of an applicant’s race.

Students for Fair Admission vs. Harvard and SFFA vs. UNC will be argued Oct. 31.

Does the Voting Rights Act call for fair and equal representation for Blacks and Latinos, sometimes requiring states to draw election districts likely to elect a Black or Latino candidate?

Lawyers for Alabama call this a form of “racial segregation” and urge the court to adopt a “race neutral” rule that frees states from this duty of fair representation for racial minorities.

About 27% of Alabama residents are Black, but only one of seven congressional districts had a Black majority under the state’s map.

Merrill vs. Milligan will be argued Oct. 4.

Does a state legislature have an “independent” and exclusive power to set the rules for federal elections, or can the state supreme court or the governor play a role as well?

This case arose when North Carolina’s Republican legislators drew a highly partisan election map that would ensure 10 of 14 congressional seats would be held by the GOP.

But the state Supreme Court ruled the map was unfair and violated the state constitution, and the judges drew a new map. Now Republican legislators are urging justices to rule the map-making power is theirs alone.

Election law experts fear such a ruling could embolden partisan lawmakers to interfere with the 2024 presidential election.

Moore vs. Harper will be heard in December.

Does a Colorado website designer who is a conservative Christian have a free-speech right to refuse to work on wedding plans for a same-sex couple, or does this discrimination violate the state’s civil rights law?

Four years ago, the justices wrestled with this question in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case involving a baker of wedding cakes but failed to decide the free-speech question.

A ruling for the Colorado plaintiff could affect California and 20 other states that forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation.

303Creative vs. Elenis will be heard in December.

Can wetlands usually be protected from development under the Clean Water Act or only if they are part of a permanent and flowing body of water?

Federal law says the Environmental Protection Agency may protect the “waters of the United States” from pollutants, but it is not clear whether the agency’s authority extends to seasonal streams or soggy land that is not directly connected to a lake, river or bay.

Sackett vs. EPA will be argued on Oct. 3.

Can California voters require that pork meat sold in the state come from farms where animals are not “abused” and where breeding pigs are given enough room to stand and turn around?

Midwest farmers say 99% of the pork sold in California comes from outside the state, and they say the state’s rules would force them to make costly changes in their operation.

The court will hear their complaint that Proposition 12 of 2018 is unconstitutional because it interferes with interstate commerce.

National Pork Producers Council vs. Ross will be argued on Oct. 11.

Can the Biden administration enforce guidelines that call for arresting and deporting only immigrants who pose a current danger to public safety, or does the law require arresting and removing anyone with a criminal record or final order of removal?

The administration argued immigration officials have always had broad discretion in enforcing the law, but a judge in Texas blocked the use of the new guidelines.

And by a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court in July refused an emergency request to lift the judge’s order.

U.S. vs. Texas is likely to be heard in December.

Does the Indian Child Welfare Act interfere with a state’s power over adoptions and foster case, and unfairly limit adoptions by parents who are not members of the child’s tribe?

Congress adopted the measure in 1978 to prevent Native American children from being removed from tribes, but Texas and three couples sued contending the law goes too far.

Haaland vs. Brackeen will be heard Nov. 9.

Did Andy Warhol make fair use of Lynn Goldsmith’s 1981 photograph of Prince by transforming it into something new and different in 1984 with his Prince series of silkscreens, or did he violate her copyright because his work was clearly derived from hers?

This is an important question of copyright law since judges are divided over whether adaptations of copyrighted material can be freely used if they are sufficiently “transformative.”

nationalreview,Abortion,"The Idaho House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy It includes a Texas-style mechanism that leaves enforcement to private citizens, rather than the state government, to sue abortion providers.

In a 51-to-14 vote, the state House approved the measure after the Senate passed it earlier this month. It now goes to the desk of Republican governor Brad Little, who is expected to enact it.

The legislation borrows from a Texas version that went into effect in September in that it allows any private individual to sue anyone who performs, aids, or abets an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, typically around six weeks of gestation. However, the Idaho bill permits only family members, including the unborn baby’s father, siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, to file a lawsuit against the provider. The enforcement provision includes an exception for rape, forbidding the rapist involved in a pregnancy from suing a provider (but allowing relatives of the rapist to sue), as well as incest and medical emergencies, to protect the life of the mother.

The Supreme Court dismissed an opportunity to review the Texas law in September, allowing it to become active in the state, but it has allowed challenges from abortion clinics to proceed against state licensing officials. After many months of litigation, the state supreme court denied the petition of abortion providers in Texas in an unanimous ruling, declaring that licensing officials have no authority, direct or indirect, to enforce the Texas Heartbeat Act. For Texas abortion providers, violation of the Heartbeat Act probably means expensive litigation.

There is an Idaho fetal-heartbeat law on the books that deems it a felony for any medical practice to provide an abortion after a heartbeat is detected. The penalty is up to five years in prison. However, that law includes a “trigger” provision with the condition that a court must turn over a favorable ruling on a similar law somewhere in the country for it to go into effect.

Like the Texas law, the Idaho bill would allow plaintiffs to seek monetary damages, cash payments of $20,000, as well as legal fee amounts, from the abortion provider. Petitioners can sue up to four years after the date of the abortion.

The Idaho legislative action comes as the Supreme Court is scheduled to weigh in on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a landmark abortion case concerning a Mississippi law that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. That cases forces the court to examine the standard of fetal viability, or 24–28 weeks of gestation, and whether abortion should be allowed prior to that. If the high court rules in favor of the Mississippi ban, Roe will effectively be reversed, deferring the issue to the states to create their own legislation permitting or barring abortion at various stages of pregnancy.

""It now goes to the desk of Republican governor Brad Little, who is expected to enact it.""\n    - This mention of the governor\'s party and the expectation of his enactment of the bill shows an association with the Republican party\'s common stance on restricting abortion rights, suggesting a more conservative ideological context.\n    \n3. ""The Supreme Court dismissed an opportunity to review the Texas law in September, allowing it to become active in the state, but it has allowed challenges from abortion clinics to proceed against state licensing officials.""\n    - The mention of Supreme Court decisions and lack thereof indicates an understanding of the national implications for abortion law, a topic often divided along ideological lines, with conservatives typically advocating for more restrictive policies.\n    \n4. ""However, that law includes a “trigger” provision with the condition that a court must turn over a favorable ruling on a similar law somewhere in the country for it to go into effect.""\n   - Including details about a so-called ""trigger"" provision shows the conditional nature of the policy—a characteristic often seen in conservative lawmakers\' strategies in seeking to minimize abortion access.\n\n5.

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a landmark abortion case concerning a Mississippi law that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.""\n   - The context of the broader national debate around abortion, including Supreme Court cases, reinforces the article\'s commitment to explaining the conservative ideological stance on abortion laws.\n\nIn summary, the article discusses Idaho\'s recent passage of a bill restricting abortion rights, positioning it within the context of a larger national debate centered on conservative-led efforts to curb abortion access. Notably, it relies on descriptive references to laws in other conservative states to frame the Idaho bill, indicating a right-wing leaning through its focus on these legislative developments.', 'The language and rhetoric in the article express a narrative that refrains from a clear endorsement or rejection of the Idaho abortion bill and strives to provide a factual report of the events and relevant legal implications. Yet there are subtle hints of a conservative or right-leaning perspective visible in how these facts are presented and framed. \n\n1. ""The Idaho House of Representatives passed a bill Monday that prohibits abortion after six weeks of pregnancy...""\n   - The introductory sentence takes a neutral tone in describing the state legislature\'s action to restrict abortion, a typically conservative position. There is no immediate critique or positive praise for the legislation made.\n\n2. ""...it now goes to the desk of Republican governor Brad Little, who is expected to enact it.""\n   - The sentence mentions the political affiliation of the governor and expectation that he will enact the policy, potentially signaling an acceptance or at least acknowledgement of the legislation\'s alignment with the Republican party\'s values, typically associated with conservatism.\n\n3. ""The legislation borrows from a Texas version that went into effect in September...""\n   - The comparison to Texas\'s similar law, without any immediate condemnation, could potentially hint at a conservative perspective, given that Texas\'s law was broadly supported by conservative politicians and figures.\n\n4. ""...the Idaho bill permits only family members, including the unborn baby’s father, siblings, grandparents, aunts, and uncles, to file a lawsuit against the provider.""\n   - Recounting the specific details of who can file a lawsuit against the provider, without critique, can suggest an acceptance of the enforcement mechanisms built into the law—a position typically associated with right-wing views on abortion.\n\n5. ""The Supreme Court dismissed an opportunity to review the Texas law in September, allowing it to become active in the state...""\n   - The phrasing seems to merely report the Supreme Court\'s action without conveying an explicit opinion. Still, presenting this information neutrally could be interpreted as subtly aligning with a conservative stance, which largely supported the court\'s decision.\n\n6. ""...a landmark abortion case concerning a Mississippi law that prohibits abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.""\n   - Labeling the mentioned Mississippi case as a ""landmark"" assigns it significant weight and importance, which suggests an interest in its potential impact on abortion law, a topic often followed closely by conservative outlets and figures.\n\n7. ""If the high court rules in favor of the Mississippi ban, Roe will effectively be reversed, deferring the issue to the states to create their own legislation permitting or barring abortion at various stages of pregnancy.""\n   - The final paragraph hypothesizes the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade and a return of legislative power to states, a concept often championed by conservative ideologies when it comes to abortion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author\'s tacit acceptance of the Idaho and Texas laws and speculation about a possible reversal of Roe v.

nationalreview,Abortion,"During the second day of her Supreme Court confirmation hearings Tuesday, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson refused to define what a “woman” is, deferring instead to scientific experts.

When asked to define “woman” by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, she replied, “I can’t…I’m not a biologist.” Blackburn shot back, “The meaning of the word woman is so unclear and controversial that you can’t give me a definition?”

“Senator, in my work as a judge, what I do is I address disputes. If there’s a dispute about a definition, people make arguments and I look at the law and I decide,” Jackson added, reiterating the methodical judicial approach she has historically applied.

Given the way the transgender debate has escalated, some Republicans are concerned about the future adjudication of cases dealing with gender identity, since some are likely to end up on the Supreme Court docket. As a nominee to the High Court, Jackson will continue to face scrutiny over her opinions on a range of cultural issues important to conservatives, including abortion, transgenderism, and racialized public school curricula.

During the Tuesday confirmation hearing, Blackburn pressed Jackson on critical race theory and whether it should be outlawed in public schools. Republican senators are likely to attempt to nail Jackson on her stance on abortion in the coming days.

“The fact that you can’t give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about,” Blackburn said. She cited the NCAA championship last weekend, where transgender athlete Lia Thomas outperformed and out-placed multiple female swimmers, some former Olympians, stripping them of their chances of advancing to finals.

“What message do you think this sends to girls who aspire to compete and win in sports at the highest levels?,” the senator asked.

Blackburn also questioned Jackson about her stance on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, which challenges the precedent set by the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade and which is currently before the Court.

“Do you commit to respecting the Court’s decision if it rules that Roe was wrongly decided and that the issue of abortion should be sent back to the states?” Blackburn asked.

“Whatever the Supreme Court decides in Dobbs will be the precedent of the Supreme Court. It will be worthy of respect in the sense that it is the precedent. I commit to treating it as I would any other precedent,” Jackson replied.

In the last couple of years, multiple Republican-dominated states, notably Florida and most recently Iowa, have passed or enacted legislation prohibiting the inclusion of biological men in women’s sports at the K-12 and collegiate levels. However, Republican governors in Indiana and Utah vetoed such legislation this week.

nationalreview,COVID,"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that the agency is working to “pivot the language” around who qualifies as fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to instead focus on who is as “up-to-date” with their shots as they “should be.”

“What we really are working to do is pivot the language to make sure that everybody is as up to date with their Covid-19 vaccine as they personally could be, should be, based on when they got their last vaccine,” Walensky said.

“We really want to make sure people are up-to-date,” she added. “That means if you recently got your second dose, you’re not eligible for a booster, you’re up-to-date. If you are eligible for a booster and you haven’t gotten it, you’re not up-to-date and you need to get your booster in order to be up-to-date.”

Walensky’s comment comes days after President Biden dodged a question on why the White House hasn’t changed the definition of “fully vaccinated” against Covid-19 to include a third booster shot and if the reason is that the number of fully-vaccinated Americans would suddenly look a lot less impressive.

He claimed that was not the reason the definition hadn’t been updated. When a reporter pressed him again he responded: “The answer is yes, get the booster shot it’s all part of the same thing. You’re better protected.”

With officials pushing Americans to receive their booster shots, many believed it was only a matter of time before the definition of “fully vaccinated” would shift from meaning two shots of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, to including a booster shot. A shifting definition could change the requirements of vaccine mandates across the country, including requirements for health care workers.

While the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the Biden administration’s vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers last week, the justices allowed a vaccine mandate for health-care workers at facilities that receive federal funding to go into effect.

CDC data show 39 percent of fully vaccinated people have gotten booster shots. However, some people may not be eligible for an additional shot yet if not enough time has passed since their most recent shot.

Meanwhile, three reports released Friday showed vaccine boosters provide robust protection against severe disease from the omicron variant in the U.S.

Data collected between August 2021 and January 5, 2022, show a third dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines was 90 percent effective at preventing hospitalization and 82 percent effective in preventing a trip to the emergency room or urgent care.

The figures follow a Labor Department report released earlier this month that showed the consumer price index, a major inflation gauge, surged 0.5 percent in December and 7.0 percent for the last twelve months ending in December, representing the largest annual spike since June 1982, when inflation hit 7.1 percent.

President Biden has claimed that supply chain disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic is partially to blame for the rising inflation. Biden’s National Economic Council director, Brian Deese, called the price increases a “global phenomenon” that “reflect the nature of the global challenge of coming through a pandemic crisis” and recovery earlier this month.

Deese said during a White House press briefing that the U.S. is in a “uniquely strong economic position” despite Americans encountering rising prices and empty shelves in stores across the country.

He crafted a story in which the U.S. had excelled economically last year, noting that it experienced the largest decline in unemployment, most jobs created and the strongest economic growth in nearly 40 years. However, he failed to acknowledge that those figures come in the wake of record destruction on the economy brought on by the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Biden has been patting himself on the back after the U.S. gross domestic product grew at 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter. He called the growth “no accident.”

“My economic strategy is creating good jobs for Americans, rebuilding our manufacturing, and strengthening our supply chains here at home to help make our companies more competitive,” Biden said.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday that it will likely raise interest rates in March in an effort to temper an overheating economy and soaring inflation.

“The committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting assuming that the conditions are appropriate for doing so,” Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said at a press briefing.

He added that inflation “has not gotten better. It has probably gotten a bit worse. . . . To the extent that situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to reflect that,” Reuters reported. “This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy we put in place to deal with the economic effects of the pandemic.”

nationalreview,Climate Change,"Following President Biden’s announcement of a punitive sanctions package against Russia as retaliation for its creeping incursion into Ukraine, White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed Tuesday that Americans should expect already sky-high energy prices to climb further.

During a press briefing, multiple reporters asked Psaki to address the cost burden Americans might incur as a result of the sanctions, which target Russian oligarchs and certain banks and aim to cut off the country from western financing. Germany also officially cancelled operation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as punishment. The pipeline was built to supply European nations with natural gas from Russia.

A reporter asked, “So, Americans should expect higher gasoline prices?” to which Psaki replied, “Yeah, energy prices, exactly that’s what we want the American public to be aware is a possibility.”

Biden slapped Russia with new “swift and severe” sanctions less than 24 hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin declared two separatist regions in Ukraine’s eastern flank independent republics and Russian troops started deploying to occupy the zones under the auspices of “peacekeeping.”

Psaki failed to explain how the Biden administration would help cushion Americans from likely gas-price increases stemming from what it is calling a “first tranche” of sanctions. She promised that more financial weapons, such as export controls, can be unleashed if Putin proceeds with provocation and military escalation further past Ukraine’s borders.

Another reporter asked, “When can we expect a more detailed explanation from the White House about how it would plan to bring down energy prices?”

“A lot of what’s happening right now is sensitive. It includes a lot of conversations with foreign counterparts and other major large global suppliers. It also includes conversations we’re continuing to have with Congress and others about what steps may be at our disposal and the president is continuing to consider options,” Psaki responded.

“Why should Americans feel that that is a cost they should have to bear and that should affect their lives and how much should they be prepared for this geopolitical crisis to impact their day to day lives?” another reporter asked.

Psaki reiterated that penalizing Russia for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity is about standing up for our “values” and “principles” as a nation while acknowledging that it will not be painless for Americans. She said Biden is in consultation with his national-security team to “leave no stone unturned” and “tap into the resources of global suppliers” to “reduce the impact on the American people.”

Potentially to minimize the burden, Psaki said the Biden administration is talking to natural-gas producers to understand their capacity and see if they’re able to surge their production to meet impending shortages.

With Russia being the third-largest producer of oil in the world and the second-largest producer of dry natural gas, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the sanctions are projected to trigger serious oil-supply disruptions, sending energy prices higher globally.

Americans are already saddled with mounting domestic inflation, having witnessed the highest prices at the pump since at least 2013 with a barrel of oil approaching $100 for the first time in seven years, Barrons noted. Brent crude oil hit an intraday high of $99.50 a barrel on Tuesday.

The Ukraine crisis has exposed how the western world is handicapped by its dependence on Russian energy — especially Europe, which gets nearly 40 percent of its natural gas and 25 percent of its oil from Russia.

nationalreview,Climate Change,"A coalition of prosecutors in Los Angeles overwhelmingly support a recall of progressive District Attorney George Gascón, who has come under fire recently for rolling back enforcement of laws against a number of offenses, including resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and making criminal threats.

The vast majority of members of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles, at 97.9 percent, voted to back a recall of Gascón. They’ve repeatedly objected to his policies, which they say have incentivized more crime by watering down the penal code.

“This vote is by those who are intimately familiar with how Mr. Gascón’s policies actually play out on a day-to-day basis,” ADDA president Michele Hanisee told Politico. “We believe the vote of our members will resonate with the voters of Los Angeles as they decide whether to recall Gascón from office and restore public safety as the priority of the District Attorney’s office.”

Another organization representing LA prosecutors confirmed there is a lot of momentum behind the movement to remove Gascón. The Los Angeles Association of Deputy District Attorneys (LAADDA) said over nine of ten prosecutors in the city want him recalled.

“It’s been one year of Gascon’s social experiment,” Eric Siddall, vice president of LAADDA, told Fox News. “I think after that one year, people have had time to evaluate whether this is working or not working. I think most people who actually live in Los Angeles [and] understand what’s going on in Los Angeles, including the political leadership here in LA, feel that this has been a miserable failure.”

The LAADDA has filed two lawsuits against Gascon claiming that some of his orders infringed on state law.

“One of the first things he did was create a set of directives — in other words, internal rules that DAs were supposed to follow. Some of those rules directly contradicted California state law,” Siddall added. “One was that we couldn’t file strikes pursuant to the three-strikes law. And the three-strikes law is a mandatory law. It’s something that the prosecutors don’t have the discretion to ignore.”

The LA County registrar approved the recall, after a similar one failed to garner enough signatures last year. To trigger an election, the recall campaign must collect between 800,000 and 900,000 petition signatures.

After pledging to stop prosecuting juveniles as adults or pursuing sentences of life in prison without parole, Gascón backtracked to say he would review the specific circumstances of each case before making a judgment. He also admitted Monday that he improperly handled the case of a 26-year-old transgender woman who was sentenced to just two years in a juvenile facility for sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl at the age of 17. After his move provoked outrage, Gascón promised to try the woman as an adult rather than a child.

“While for most people several years of jail time is adequate, it may not be for Ms. Tubbs,” the progressive DA said in a statement. “If we knew about her disregard for the harm she caused we would have handled this case differently. The complex issues and facts of her particular case were unusual, and I should have treated them that way.”

nationalreview,Economy,"More Americans believe inflation is the nation’s most important problem now than at any point since 1985, according to a Gallup poll released on Tuesday.

Seventeen percent of Americans said rising prices are the country’s most important problem, the survey found. The figure is up from 10 percent in February and 8 percent in January.

In 1985, 18 percent of Americans said inflation was the nation’s most important issue, according to Gallup.

The renewed concern comes as inflation has hit its highest point in 40 years and gas prices have skyrocketed since Russia invaded Ukraine. Four percent of Americans cited fuel prices specifically as the greatest problem in March.

Consumer prices rose 7.9 percent in February from the year prior, the Labor Department announced this month. The increase was the largest since January 1982, which saw an 8.6 percent jump.

Meanwhile, 59 percent of respondents said they worry about cost-of-living expenses a “great deal,” the poll found.

Inflation first began rising as a public concern last fall, according to Gallup. While rising prices registered no more than 2 percent of mentions in 2021, that number jumped in October when 5 percent of Americans cited inflation as the most pressing issue.

A majority of families earning $40,000 or more (63 percent) said they are very concerned about rising costs, while 58 percent of those earning $100,000 or more said the same.

Republicans were much more concerned about inflation, with 79 percent of Republicans expressing serious concern about rising cost-of-living, while just 35 percent of Democrats said the same.

“Inflation doesn’t dominate Americans’ perceptions of the most important problem facing the country today the way it did in the early 1980s, but it’s more top-of-mind than it’s been in over three decades and appears to be taking a toll on Americans’ broader economic confidence,” Gallup said in a news release.

Sixty-eight percent of respondents cited one of several noneconomic issues as the country’s most pressing problem, including 22 percent of Americans who believe the government and poor leadership are the most important problem. Nine percent said the war in Ukraine is the most important problem.

The poll was conducted March 1-18 among 1,017 adults and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

nationalreview,Economy,"The consumer price index went up by 7.5 percent over the last year, the highest annual increase since February 1982.

Inflation increased at the fastest rate in 40 years over the last twelve months, outpacing projections, the U.S. Department of Labor announced Thursday.

The consumer price index (CPI) — a major measure of inflation covering a variety of consumer goods — surged 0.6 percent over the last month and 7.5 percent over the last twelve months ending in January. That represents the largest annual spike since February 1982, when inflation hit 7.62 percent.

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also went up by 0.6 percent in January, following another 0.6 percent increase in December. This marks the seventh time in the ten months that it has increased at least 0.5 percent. The Core CPI increased by 6.0 percent annually, the steepest 12-month jump since

 the period ending August 1982.

Food, electricity, and shelter contributed the most to the seasonally adjusted all items increase. Energy prices picked up 0.9 percent for the month, with rising electricity costs being somewhat offset by declines in gasoline and natural gas costs.

The persistent inflation, exacerbated by a supply chain crisis marked by production bottlenecks and shipping delays, has prompted the Federal Reserve to switch strategy. Starting in March, Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently indicated, the central bank could start to reverse its accommodative monetary policy and hike interest rates to curb spiraling inflation. The Fed is also likely to start unloading its gigantic balance sheet and roll back the pace of its large scale asset purchases that have been injecting stimulus into the economy for years.

While pressure is piling on the Fed to slow inflationary pressures strangling many Americans at the gas pump, grocery store, and across goods and services, the stock market is expected to react poorly in the event of an interest rate increase. After Powell’s announcement of quantitative tightening, major stock indices the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite dipped 1 percent, 0.9 percent, and 0.7 percent, respectively. The tradeoff for combating inflation is often a drag in economic production, although while restoring purchasing power to consumers.

For months, the Fed maintained its monetary easing despite mounting inflation, projecting that the price hikes would temper as market imbalances rectified. However, that prediction proved wrong, as supply and demand mismatches continued and inflation has climbed each consecutive month since early 2020. Powell suggested recently that if the Fed doesn’t intervene, inflation could intensify.

“Inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants, and certainly in my view as well. There’s a risk that the high inflation we are seeing will be prolonged. There’s a risk that it will move even higher. So, we don’t think that’s the base case, but, you asked what the risks are, and we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes,” he said recently.

nationalreview,Election,"Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) tore into President Biden’s speech advocating a suspension of filibuster rules, in remarks on the Senate floor on Wednesday.

“The president’s rant — rant — yesterday was incoherent, incorrect, and beneath his office,” McConnell said.

Biden gave a speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on Tuesday in an attempt to drum up support for suspending filibuster rules in order to pass voting legislation. McConnell blasted the speech as a demagogic attempt to cast Republicans as racists over their opposition to federalizing elections.

“The president repeatedly invoked the January 6th riot while himself using irresponsible, delegitimizing rhetoric that undermines our democracy,” McConnell continued. “The sitting president of the United States compared American states to totalitarian states. . . . So the world saw our commander-in-chief propagandize against his own country to a degree that would have made Pravda blush.”

McConnell decried Biden’s rhetoric as painting millions of voters and a majority of the Senate as “racist.”

“A president shouting that 52 senators and millions of Americans are racist unless he gets whatever he wants is proving exactly why the Framers built the Senate to check his power,” McConnell said. “This whole display is the best possible argument for preserving the Senate rules that extend deliberation, force bipartisan compromise, and let cooler heads prevail.”

Biden compared opponents of Democrats’ voting legislation to southern segregationists in his Tuesday speech, asking, “Do you want to be on the side of Dr. King or George Wallace?”

One of the bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, would restore portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required districts with a history of discrimination to obtain approval from the Justice Department before changing voting rules.

A second bill, the Freedom to Vote Act, would set a 15-day minimum early voting period, set national voter-ID standards that would include a range of documentation, make it easier for residents to sue states over redistricting issues, and make Election Day a federal holiday.

nationalreview,Election,"Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton again on Thursday repudiated as a phony scandal the recent revelation that operatives connected to her campaign allegedly spied on the Trump administration as part of an effort to cook up a Russia-collusion narrative.

During her keynote speech for the 2022 New York State Democratic Convention, Clinton said Durham’s findings are a “right-wing lie” meant to serve as a distraction from Trump’s own scandals.

“And we can’t get distracted. Whether it’s by the latest culture war nonsense or some new right-wing lie on Fox or Facebook. By the way, they’ve been coming after me again in case you might have noticed. It’s funny, the more trouble Trump gets into the wilder the charges and conspiracy theories about me seem to get,” she said.

“So now his accountants have fired him and investigations draw closer to him and right on cue the noise machine gets turned up…” she added. “Fox leads the charge against me, counting on their audience to fall for it again. They’re getting awfully close to actual malice in their attacks.”

Special counsel John Durham is currently trying to get to the bottom of the extensive Trump/Russia probe launched by the Obama administration that spanned into the Trump administration, consuming the press and public for two years.

In a court filing last week, Durham claimed that a technology executive “exploited his access to non-public and/or proprietary Internet data” to extract contacts between Moscow and facilities tied to Trump. Those facilities included Trump Tower, Trump’s Central Park West apartment building, and the executive office of the presidency, after Trump had already been inaugurated, according to the court filing.

Durham’s filing only identified the person as “Tech Executive-1,” the Washington Examiner reported. However, previous reporting by CNN indicated that that individual is Rodney Joffe, a senior vice president at Neustar who was also a client of Michael Sussmann, a partner at Perkins Coie, the high-powered law firm that represented the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party.

Durham had previously indicted Sussmann for lying to the FBI to obscure his association with the Clinton campaign. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty.

Durham alleges that the unnamed tech executive delivered the data he collected to Sussmann, who then allegedly brought it to the FBI and the CIA alleging an improper connection between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin.

Durham also noted that the unnamed technology executive worked with an investigative firm that Perkins Coie hired on behalf of the Clinton campaign. The executive abused his company’s “sensitive arrangement” to provide services to the executive office of the president “for the purpose of gathering derogatory information about Donald Trump,” Durham reportedly alleged.

Since Durham’s bombshell dropped, Trump released statements accusing Clinton of orchestrating an “espionage campaign on his New York City apartment.”

“The latest pleading from Special Counsel Robert [sic] Durham provides indisputable evidence that my campaign and presidency were spied on by operatives paid by the Hillary Clinton Campaign in an effort to develop a completely fabricated connection to Russia,” Trump said in an email statement.

“This is a scandal far greater in scope and magnitude than Watergate and those who were involved in and knew about this spying operation should be subject to criminal prosecution,” he added.

nationalreview,Immigration,"Australia has rejected the visa of Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic over an inadmissible medical vaccine exemption. A nine-time champion of the Australian Open, who abstained from receiving the shot, Djokovic is expected to be disqualified from competing to defend his 2021 title by the country’s authorities for improper entry paperwork.

The player “failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements for Australia and visa has been subsequently canceled,” Australia Health Minister Greg Hunt said in an on-camera interview with local press on Thursday.

After traveling to Melbourne to participate in the tournament, Djokovic is reportedly being held at the airport for presenting a visa that does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated, according to Australian news outlets.

The Australian Border Force raised the issue of the athlete’s visa with the state Victoria government and suspended his admission into the country, according to The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.

“The Australian Border Force will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our laws and entry requirements,” a statement from the agency read. “Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa canceled will be detained and removed from Australia.”

nationalreview,Immigration,"President Biden compared the influx of Ukrainian refugees in Poland to the situation at the U.S.–Mexico border in comments during a meeting with Polish president Andrzej Duda in Warsaw on Saturday.

Poland has absorbed over 2.2 million Ukrainian refugees since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine at the end of February. Biden called on other NATO allies to receive more refugees fleeing from the war.

“We do acknowledge that Poland is taking on a significant responsibility that I don’t think should just be Poland, it should be the whole world—all of NATO’s responsibility. The fact that you have so many Ukrainians seeking refuge in this country of Poland, we understand that because we have on our southern border thousands of people a day—literally, not figuratively—trying to get to the United States,” Biden said at a bilateral meeting with Duda.

Biden added that his administration believes it should “do our part relative to Ukraine as well by opening our borders to another 100,000 people,” apparently referencing a decision to accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees under temporary protected status.

U.S. border agents encountered over 2 million migrants at the southern border during President Biden’s first year in office. The influx saw record-breaking monthly totals, with a high of 213,593 encounters recorded in July 2021.

The U.S. border crisis is ongoing with 164,973 migrant encounters reported in February, up over 60 percent from February 2021. A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement report released in March showed that ICE arrests and deportations dropped after the president assumed office.

nationalreview,Police,"One year into his presidency, it seems like Joe Biden and the Democrats in Washington, D.C. have sent the country back in time to the late-1970s and early 80s, “when runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map,” Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said Tuesday night, in the official Republican response to Biden’s State of the Union address.

Speaking in front of the Iowa state capitol in Des Moines, Reynolds attacked Biden’s international and domestic record, and she made the case for putting faith in the American people. Dressed in red and wearing an American and Ukrainian flag pin, she spoke about 15 minutes.

When he was elected, Biden promised to make America respected again on the world stage and unite the country. Instead, Reynolds said, “he’s failed on both fronts.”

Internationally, Reynolds said, the “disastrous” Afghanistan withdrawal betrayed American allies and embolden the country’s enemies. Biden did not address the Afghanistan withdrawal in his speech. And while Reynolds said Americans should stand united with the people of Ukraine who are fighting back against a Russian onslaught, she said Americans shouldn’t ignore Biden’s actions in the run-up to the invasion.

“Waiving sanctions on Russian pipelines,” she said. “Eliminating oil production here at home. Focusing on political correctness rather than military readiness. Reacting to world events instead of driving them.”

It is time for America to lead again on the world stage, Reynold said. “But we can’t project strength abroad if we’re weak at home.”

Reynolds accused Biden of ignoring Republican warnings that increased government spending would lead to inflation, and that the administration’s anti-energy policies would lead to soaring gas prices. She said inflation is not a “high-class problem,” but is instead an “everybody problem.”

Biden and Democratic leaders need to step outside the D.C. bubble, and talk to regular Americans about their concerns, and “what keeps them up at night.”

“I can tell you what’s not on that list,” she said. “They won’t tell you that spending trillions more and bankrupting their children is the answer to their problems. They won’t tell you that we should be paying people not to work. And they certainly won’t tell you that we should be giving billions in tax giveaways to millionaires and billionaires in Democratic controlled states like California, New York, and New Jersey.”

Reynolds said Americans are tired of elites who tell others what they can and cannot say, what they can and cannot believe, and they’re tired of hypocritical politicians who tell their citizens to stay home during the Covid-19 pandemic, while they sneak off to Florida for “sun and fun.” Americans are tired of liberal prosecutors letting criminals off easy while crime soars, and they’re fed up with an administration that proposed vaccination requirements for people who want to work, but not for immigrants who cross the border illegally, Reynolds said.

“The American people are left to feel like they’re the enemy”, she said, and they “are waiting for the insanity to stop.”

Reynolds praised Republican governors and red state leaders who are “balancing budgets and cutting taxes,” and who she said listened to science when it came to not requiring masks for kids at schools. School shutdowns have led to learning loss, isolation, and anxiety among America’s kids, she said.

“That’s why Iowa was the first state in the nation to require that schools open their doors,” she said. “I was attacked by the left. I was attacked by the media. But it wasn’t a hard choice.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called Reynold’s message “optimistic” and “a stark contrast to Biden’s broken promises and Democrats’ divisive agenda.”

“Republican officials like Kim Reynolds have a record of real solutions helping struggling American families, workers, and small businesses,” McDaniel said in a prepared statement.

nationalreview,Police,"Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been sentenced to serve another nine years in prison after he was convicted on trumped up embezzlement and contempt of court on Tuesday.

“Navalny committed fraud — the theft of property by an organized group,” Judge Margarita Kotova announced the verdict, according to Agence France-Presse. The court also found him guilty of being disrespectful to the court.

The sentence extension was announced shortly after the verdict, according to the Moscow Times.

Navalny had been accused of stealing several million dollars worth of donations from his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The prosecution in the case last week demanded that Navalny’s sentence be extended to 13 years, that he be moved to a “strict regime” penal colony, and that he pay a fine of 1.2 million rubles, or about $11,500.

The anti-corruption activist had already been imprisoned for two-and-a-half years at a detention center for violating probation related to a previous conviction on sham embezzlement charges. Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia to face the charges after after spending a month in a German hospital, where he was being treated for nerve-agent poisoning.

The former mayoral and presidential candidate claimed his treatment was politically motivated and green-lighted by Putin’s regime. The Kremlin denied that it played a role. Protests erupted across Russia in the two weeks prior to his sentencing and also after it was handed down, which were squashed by Russian authorities.

Navalny looked defiant and calm on video camera Tuesday, flipping through documents as the verdict was read. Each time he has been convicted of criminal activity by Russia, he has doubled down. On March 15, he posted on Instagram, “If the prison term is the price of my human right to say things that need to be said … then they can ask for 113 years. I will not renounce my words or deeds.”

Navalny and his close associates were listed on the “extremist and terrorist” federal registry in Russia, according to the Russian Federal Service for Financial Monitoring. Russian courts banned his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) last year, calling it an “extremist” group.

The dissident’s likely prison extension comes amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which has triggered anti-war demonstrations across Russia and police crackdowns. In the early days of the conflict, Russian police arrested thousands of protestors calling for peace. In January, Navalny criticized the Biden administration for failing to confront the Kremlin for its aggression, likening the U.S. to a ” frightened schoolboy ” who cowers to a bully. At that point, Russia had ramped up its provocation, stationing over 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine.

Navalny told Time’s Simon Shuster, “Time and again the West falls into Putin’s elementary traps. It just takes my breath away, watching how Putin pulls this on the American establishment again and again.”

President Biden has repeatedly condemned Russia’s treatment of Navalny, warning last June that his death would erode U.S.-Russia relations. But that relationship has greatly deteriorated anyway since Russia launched the assault on its neighbor.

""The anti-corruption activist had already been imprisoned for two-and-a-half years at a detention center for violating probation related to a previous conviction on sham embezzlement charges.""\n   - Again, the presence of the term ""sham"" in describing the charges against Navalny signals a criticism of the Russian government\'s handling of his case. This is common within the right-leaning ideology that often criticizes non-democratic governance.\n\n4. ""The former mayoral and presidential candidate claimed his treatment was politically motivated and green-lighted by Putin’s regime. The Kremlin denied that it played a role.""\n   - By reporting Navalny\'s claim of political motivations behind his treatment, the article implicitly suggests sympathy to his situation. This is characteristic of a right-leaning ideology that favors the exposure of injustices by authoritarian regimes.\n\n5. ""In January, Navalny criticized the Biden administration for failing to confront the Kremlin for its aggression, likening the U.S. to a ” frightened schoolboy ” who cowers to a bully.""\n   - The inclusion of Navalny\'s critique of the Biden administration\'s response to Russia signals an editorial stance that criticizes the U.S. administration\'s international approach. This is indicative of a right-leaning ideology where conservatives often criticize perceived weakness in foreign policy under democratic leadership.\n\n6. ""President Biden has repeatedly condemned Russia’s treatment of Navalny, warning last June that his death would erode U.S.-Russia relations. But that relationship has greatly deteriorated anyway since Russia launched the assault on its neighbor.""\n   - Ending the article on a pointed critique of President Biden\'s ineffectual warnings exemplifies a perspective that doubts the administration\'s effectiveness in international relations, often present in right-wing ideologies.\n\nIn conclusion, the repeated critique of the Russian government, sympathy for Alexei Navalny, and doubts about the effectiveness of the Biden administration\'s approach suggest an underlying right-wing or conservative political ideology.', 'The article discusses the ongoing legal troubles of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and his struggle against the Russian government. Based on the language and rhetoric used, the article exhibits a right-wing leaning viewpoint that supports Navalny\'s claims and criticizes the actions of the Kremlin. It also critiques the response of the U.S. administration to the situation, characteristic of right-leaning perspectives.\n\n1. ""Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been sentenced … he was convicted on trumped up embezzlement and contempt of court.""\n   - The phrase ""trumped up"" suggests the charges against Navalny are fabricated. This indicates a viewpoint aligning with Navalny\'s own claim - considered by many to be a right-leaning perspective acknowledging the authoritarian nature of Putin\'s regime.\n\n2. ""Navalny had been accused of stealing several million dollars worth of donations from his Anti-Corruption Foundation."" \n   - The phrase ""had been accused"" is neutral but establishes context for the subsequent criticism of the Russian government\'s treatment of Navalny.\n\n3. ""Navalny voluntarily returned to Russia to face the charges after after spending a month in a German hospital, where he was being treated for nerve-agent poisoning.""\n   - The fact that Navalny voluntarily returned to face charges after recuperating from an assassination attempt emphasized his courage and commitment to his cause, highlighting his heroism - a viewpoint common in right-leaning circles.\n\n4. ""The former mayoral and presidential candidate claimed his treatment was politically motivated and green-lighted by Putin’s regime.""\n   - Here it quotes Navalny’s claim that his treatment by Putin\'s government is politically motivated, suggesting alignment with his view.\n\n5. ""Protests erupted across Russia in the two weeks prior to his sentencing and also after it was handed down, which were squashed by Russian authorities.""\n   - The use of ""squashed"" can suggest that the Russian authorities have acted repressively and unjustly in suppressing protests, a viewpoint which usually sides with criticism towards authoritarian governments.\n\n6. ""Navalny and his close associates were listed on the “extremist and terrorist” federal registry in Russia.""\n   - By putting extremist and terrorist in quotes, suggests skepticism towards the labels given by the Russia government, and in turn hints at disapproval of the Russian government’s actions.\n\n7. ""In January, Navalny criticized the Biden administration for failing to confront the Kremlin for its aggression, likening the U.S. to a ” frightened schoolboy ” who cowers to a bully.""\n   - This reference to Navalny\'s criticism of the Biden administration reflects a point of view often seen in right-wing perspectives, criticizing the US administration’s approach to Russia.\n\n8. ""President Biden has repeatedly condemned Russia’s treatment of Navalny, warning last June that his death would erode U.S.-Russia relations. But that relationship has greatly deteriorated anyway since Russia launched the assault on its neighbor.""\n   - The conclusion in this passage insinuates that despite Biden\'s condemnations, his administration\'s approach has not been successful. This mirrors perspectives often seen in right-wing spaces that are critical of the current administration\'s foreign policies.\n\nOverall, the article exhibits a right-leaning perspective through its emphasis on Navalny\'s struggles against the Putin regime and its critique of the U.S. administration\'s response. The language and rhetoric used generally sides with Navalny\'s perspectives and criticisms of both the Russian and U.S. governments.', 'The article uses language and rhetoric that suggests a right-leaning or conservative ideological perspective. Evidence of this is highlighted through various snippets from the article:\n\n1. ""Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been sentenced to serve another nine years in prison after he was convicted on trumped up embezzlement and contempt of court on Tuesday.""\n   - The term \'trumped up\' implies that the charges laid on Navalny are false or exaggerated which aligns conversatively as they typically criticise acts against democracy and free speech.\n\n2. ""“Navalny committed fraud — the theft of property by an organized group,” Judge Margarita Kotova announced the verdict, according to Agence France-Presse. The court also found him guilty of being disrespectful to the court.""\n   - The quoting of Judge Margarita Kotova gives a factual representation of the court\'s verdict, demonstrating a neutral but leaning towards conservative perspective being that this ruling is seen as suppression of opposition.\n\n3. ""The anti-corruption activist had already been imprisoned for two-and-a-half years at a detention center for violating probation related to a previous conviction on sham embezzlement charges.""\n   - The author once again suggests that the charges against Navalny are false or exaggerated (\'sham\') highlighting a conservative-leaning perspective as conservatives generally align with anti-corruption and strong criticism against unfair trials.\n\n4. ""The former mayoral and presidential candidate claimed his treatment was politically motivated and green-lighted by Putin’s regime.""\n   - The writer presents Navalny\'s claim of his sentences being politically motivated, which aligns with conservative ideologies that criticize authoritative leadership denying freedom of speech/opposition.\n\n5. ""Navalny looked defiant and calm on video camera Tuesday, flipping through documents as the verdict was read. Each time he has been convicted of criminal activity by Russia, he has doubled down.""\n   - The visuals of Navalny looking “defiant” and “calm” suggests a focus on his resilience against oppressive actions, which syncs with right-leaning perspectives.\n\n6. ""Navalny told Time’s Simon Shuster, \'Time and again the West falls into Putin’s elementary traps. It just takes my breath away, watching how Putin pulls this on the American establishment again and again.\'""\n   - Quoting Navalny\'s criticism of the West for falling into Putin\'s traps hints at a right-leaning perspective, which tends to be tough on national security and foreign relations, and especially vociferous against Russia\'s interference.\n\nIn summary, this article aligns more with conservative ideologies with a strong critique against Putin\'s regime and his handling of Navalny, focusing more on freedom of speech, opposition against authoritative government and strong stances on foreign relations.']",6.5,1.0,0.5
newsmax,Abortion,"A court's ruling that Florida can keep its ban on abortions that take place past 15 weeks of pregnancy is a win not only for the right to life, but also ""for the sanctity of our Constitution,"" Rep. Kat Cammack said on Newsmax Wednesday.

""I am so lucky to live in a state where we have incredibly strong leadership out of our state officials, of course, Gov. Ron DeSantis at the helm, but it was actually our attorney general, Ashley Moody, who within minutes of the district circuit judge issuing that ruling [to lift the ban] that she filed an appeal, which has led to the will of the people here in Florida to be upheld,"" the Florida Republican told Newsmax's ""National Report.""

In Florida, the state promptly filed an appeal soon after Circuit Court Judge John Cooper finalized an expected order blocking enforcement of a 15-week ban that took effect on Friday, which automatically froze the injunction.

""Our entire system of government is predicated on this notion of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,"" Cammack said, noting that after the Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade, states like Florida are ""leading the charge in protecting life, and I couldn't be more proud of that.""

The congresswoman, meanwhile, slammed companies such as Disney which have promised to cover travel costs for employees seeking abortions.

""It's interesting how they like to choose ala carte the human rights issues that they're going to uphold,"" she said. ""When it comes to all lives or unborn lives, they don't seem to [care]. It's really interesting that as these companies continue to push out this woke messaging to try to appease the limousine liberal base that is growing across the country.

""They're also really quiet when it comes to the fact that many of these companies do not offer maternity leave or paid maternity leave. ""

Cammack said Republicans are working on legislation to help make adoption more accessible and more affordable, as well as finding ways to support working mothers.

""That's what the pro-life movement is all about,"" she said. ""It's about empowering women and being part of the post-Roe generation means that we have a tremendous responsibility to stand up for our women.""

The congresswoman also on Wednesday slammed California's Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom for running advertising urging people in Florida to move to his state ""where we still believe in freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate, and the freedom to love.""

""He would have been better off taking all that cash that it cost him to do that and just lighting it on fire,"" she said. ""There's a saying in politics that you never punch down and so clearly what we're seeing here is a pathetic attempt by Gov. Newsom to take a swipe at our governor, who is now being known as America's governor, because he stands up for families and individuals and businesses.""

She added that ""60,000 Californians over the last three years now getting Florida driver's licenses because they're fleeing California because of oppression … if it wasn't so sad, it would be funny, but I mean, what do you expect when you have a guy who's related to Nancy Pelosi and has lower approval ratings than Joe Biden?""

newsmax,Abortion,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Wednesday on Newsmax accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of sounding the ""dog whistle"" that led to an armed man showing up in the early morning hours outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home.

""The left always gives a dog whistle of violence, and Chuck Schumer is on record on video, calling for violence, basically a dog whistle for them to come after Justices Kavanaugh and [Neil] Gorsuch,"" the Georgia Republican said on Newsmax's ""John Bachman Now."" ""He named them by name, and he said they won't even know what hit them. Was he talking about a bullet? Was he talking about a knife? What kind of attack?""

In March, Schumer, D-N.Y., was criticized after standing outside the Supreme Court, surrounded by abortion rights supporters, and commenting that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh ""have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,"" reports The Washington Post.

The comments came while the justices were deliberating a crucial Louisiana abortion case, and before the Roe v. Wade leak indicating that the court would overturn the landmark 1973 decision. Schumer has denied making a call for violence with his comments, with a spokesman saying he meant Republicans would pay a political price"" for an anti-abortion decision, but Greene on Newsmax disagreed.

""Clearly he was talking about something and some of their foot soldiers took their orders, and this man was found at Kavanaugh's house ready to kill him,"" Greene insisted.

She also said that there has been no effort to go after the person who leaked the Roe v. Wade draft decision, which has left the conservative-leaning justices' lives in danger. Further, protests have been allowed to be held at the justices' homes, and that should have been stopped, Greene commented.

""There should have been a bigger effort by the Department of Justice to stop these protests, and thankfully, this man was arrested before he did the unthinkable,"" said Greene. ""Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and others, we don't see an effort for them to protect anyone but themselves.""

Greene also lambasted Democrats for their decision to call victims and families from the Uvalde school shootings to Washington, D.C. to testify in the gun control legislation hearings on Capitol Hill, including one little girl who covered herself in blood to survive.

""It's shameful to pull these families, especially an 11-year-old girl who laid there in the blood of her classmates after they had been murdered, just trying to be quiet and protect her own life,"" she said. ""These families are in mourning. They should be left alone not used as political props and some sort of stunt to force and persuade other members of Congress to vote for gun control in America.

""We don't have a gun problem in America, we have a sin problem … our children are our future. And so we should do everything we can to keep them safe at school and never, ever allow anything to happen to them or any parent to have to fear what may happen.""

Marjorie Taylor Greene Wednesday on Newsmax accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of sounding the ""dog whistle"" that led to an armed man showing up in the early morning hours outside Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh\'s home.""\n   - This quote leans to the right-wing ideology, as Greene, a prominent conservative figure, critically accuses Schumer, a key figure in the Democratic Party, of indirectly inciting violence.\n\n2. ""The left always gives a dog whistle of violence, and Chuck Schumer is on record on video, calling for violence, basically a dog whistle for them to come after Justices Kavanaugh and [Neil] Gorsuch.""\n   - This statement continues the right-leaning interpretation by accusing the left, represented here by Schumer, of advocating for violence against right-wing figures, specifically Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch.\n\n3. ""Clearly he was talking about something and some of their foot soldiers took their orders, and this man was found at Kavanaugh\'s house ready to kill him,"" Greene insisted.\n   - Greene\'s assertion that Schumer\'s comments indirectly called for violent action against Kavanaugh continues the right-leaning narrative.

Greene, thus, frames their approach as manipulative, reinforcing the article\'s slant towards right-wing ideology.\n\n5.

It appeals to conservative readers by highlighting perceived threats towards conservative figures and policies.', 'The article\'s language and rhetoric suggest a strong leaning towards a right-wing, conservative ideology as demonstrated by the emphasis on accusing left-wing figures, downplaying the need for gun control, and decrying perceived threats to conservative figures.\n\n1.

""Greene also lambasted Democrats for their decision to call victims and families from the Uvalde school shootings to Washington, D.C. to testify in the gun control legislation hearings on Capitol Hill.""\n   - This emphasizes a right-wing bias by providing a platform for a critique of Democrats\' strategies surrounding gun control debate, showing sympathy for gun rights.\n\n5.

And so we should do everything we can to keep them safe at school and never, ever allow anything to happen to them or any parent to have to fear what may happen.""\n   - The dismissal of a gun problem and focus on a ""sin problem"" is typical of right-wing perspectives as it aligns with beliefs in individual and moral responsibility over social or structural solutions like gun control. \n\nAt the end of the article, an advertisement for Newsmax, a conservative-leaning news source, is another indicator of the right-wing slant of the text.

""Rep.

The use of the term ""dog whistle"" also implies a secretive, or manipulative intent coming from the Democrats.\n   \n2. ""The left always gives a dog whistle of violence, and Chuck Schumer is on record on video, calling for violence...What kind of attack?""\n   - The accusation that the left always incites violence is prominent in conservative rhetoric, painting the left as dangerous and aggressive.\n\n3. ""Schumer has denied making a call for violence with his comments, with a spokesman saying he meant Republicans would pay a political price"" for an anti-abortion decision, but Greene on Newsmax disagreed.""\n   - The dismissal of Schumer\'s defense and siding with Greene\'s opposing view further emphasizes the article\'s right-leaning stance.\n\n4. """"Clearly he was talking about something and some of their foot soldiers took their orders, and this man was found at Kavanaugh\'s house ready to kill him,"" Greene insisted.""\n   - Using hyperbolic language to exaggerate perceived dangers from the left aligns with right-wing ideologies creating narratives of fear associated with left-wing entities.\n\n5. ""Democrat leaders like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, and others, we don\'t see an effort for them to protect anyone but themselves.""\n   - The depiction of major Democratic figures as self-centered and uncaring leans towards right-wing ideologies, where criticism of Democratic leaders is a common tenet.\n\n6. ""Greene also lambasted Democrats for their decision to call victims and families from the Uvalde school shootings to Washington, D.C. to testify in the gun control legislation hearings on Capitol Hill.""\n   - The disapproval towards the Democrats\' efforts related to gun control aligns with right-wing ideologies that often resist gun regulation measures.\n\n7. ""It\'s shameful to pull these families, especially an 11-year-old girl who laid there in the blood of her classmates after they had been murdered, just trying to be quiet and protect her own life...

""NEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!""\n   - Newsmax is known for its conservative leanings, and would likely reflect right-wing ideologies in their narratives. This self-promotion within the article continues to align with a right-wing perspective.\n\nIn summary, this article prominently adopts a conservative perspective, as it criticizes Democratic figures and policies, argues against gun control, and promotes rhetoric that criminalizes left-leaning entities.

newsmax,COVID,"Although Americans continue to be worried about the spread of COVID-19, the vast majority say it is time to accept it as part of life, according to a new Monmouth University Poll released on Monday.

A full 70% of Americans agree with the sentiment that ""it's time we accept that COVID is here to stay, and we just need to get on with our lives,"" including 78% of those who report having gotten the coronavirus, and 65% of those who say they have not been infected.

The survey finds a majority of the public continues to back some preventative measures, but not others.

For example, 52% support instituting, or reinstituting, face mask and social distancing guidelines in their home state, which is less than December (55%) and September (63%), but is the same as last July (52%) when COVID-19's spread was at its lowest ebb so far.

However, only 43% back requiring people to show proof of vaccination in order to work in an office or other setting where they are around other people after support was at 53% in September and 46% last month.

""We still see public support for maintaining some degree of public safety around COVID,"" Monmouth University Polling Institute Director Patrick Murray said. ""However, there appears to be an acknowledgment that federal measures have not been effective, or at least have failed to be widely accepted.""

Other results from the poll indicate:
• Partisanship is the the main difference in the sense that it is time to move on — ranging from 89% of Republicans and 71% of independents to 47% of Democrats.
• Only 34% of the public feel the country will get the outbreak under control and return to normal by the end of the year, with 28% saying a return to normalcy will never happen, which is up from 22% who felt this way in September, and just 6% who were similarly pessimistic a year ago.
• Half, 50%, are either very (23%) or somewhat (27%) concerned about catching one of the new COVID variants. Even so, 37% remain unlikely to ever get a booster shot, including 17% who remain opposed even to getting the initial vaccination.
• Just 43% say President Joe Biden has done a good job on handling the pandemic, while 53% say he has done a bad job — the first time his rating on this metric has been underwater since he took office. Public opinion on the president’s handling of COVID-19 was evenly split a month ago (46% good job and 46% bad job) and was consistently positive in polls prior to that.
• Views of federal health agencies' handling of the pandemic have now fallen into negative territory (46% good job and 47% bad job) after declining but remaining positive a month ago (48% good and 41% bad).

The poll was carried out by telephone from Jan. 20-24, with 794 adults.

newsmax,COVID,"While it will take years to get going, there is a looming race for a casino in New York City, with Times Square, Citi Field, and Hudson Yards as potential prime locations for the world's largest untapped casino market.

State budget negotiations under Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul are weighing dropping a ban on new casinos until 2023, and New York City is a potential location that figures to bring one big-dollar lobbying.

""I believe in New York City; I think we are going to come back,"" Bally's Corp. Chair Soo Kim, who grew up on Queens, told Politico.

There are two horse tracks with video-lottery terminals in the New York City area, MGM's Resorts World New York City in Queens and Empire City Casino in Yonkers, but they figure to be the first houses to benefit when lobbyists get gambling laws to permit a full-fledged casino in the city.

""We are ready to deliver thousands of new jobs for Westchester and the Bronx while generating $1 billion in new economic activity with a full gaming license,"" MGM wrote in a statement, according to Politico. ""Empire City Casino by MGM Resorts is ready to roar.""

New York City, with 20 million people and once a tourist capital before the COVID-19 pandemic, has had its residents take their gambling budgets to Atlantic City, New Jersey, or Native American Casinos in Connecticut, but all that tax income could help the city rebound from economic downturn from the pandemic.

""With a responsible approach to pursuing new casino licenses downstate, we have a unique and timely opportunity to put unemployed hospitality workers back to work while also giving our economy a much needed boost,"" New York Hotel and Gaming Trades Council President Rich Maroko.

His union backs a plan for Resorts World at Aqueduct Racetrack to become into a full casino, once 2014's gambling law is relaxed before 2023's exclusive licenses on New York's upstate casino houses expire.

""It's going to happen soon enough anyway – if we're ready to do it and all the infrastructure is in place and the regulatory structure is in place, why not do it sooner?"" state Sen. Mike Gianaris, D-Queens, told Politico.

In addition to the $500 million initiation fee hurdle, regulatory and tax burdens, there is opposition expected, particularly for the most choice locations of Manhattan.

""My concern, representing Manhattan and Times Square is the neighborhoods which would be adjacent to any proposed casino and the impact,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman, D-Manhattan, told Politico. ""Casinos can have negative externalities, to put it mildly.

""I oppose them strongly and generally have done so in the legislature. When it is in my Senate district, it is even a greater concern.""

University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley political science professor Clyde Barrow is skeptical New York City can make enough to overcome the costs of operation.

""The state is going to look to maximize net new revenues and net new job growth in making the decision on where to locate them,"" Barrow told Politico. ""When you put a casino in the middle of nowhere or in a small city, there are limited alternative entertainment venues competing against it.

""But when you put a casino in Manhattan or in Queens, you are competing against every other entertainment, amusement and recreation facility in that city, so it is a vastly more competitive market in which people have lots of other alternatives on how to spend their entertainment dollars.""

""It will generate hundreds of millions of dollars, but it won’t be anywhere near the revenue generation forecasts.""","[5, 6, 6, 4]","['This article appears to maintain a neutral perspective in its discussion about the potential of new casinos in New York City.

""In addition to the $500 million initiation fee hurdle, regulatory and tax burdens, there is opposition expected, particularly for the most choice locations of Manhattan.""\n - Mentioning the financial and regulatory hurdles in the way of the formation of new casinos may be seen as criticism of red tape and regulations, a common point of contention among right-leaning individuals arguing for less government interference in business.\n\n4. ""University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley political science professor Clyde Barrow is skeptical New York City can make enough to overcome the costs of operation.""\n    - The note of skepticism regarding the profit potential of the casinos aligned with operational costs could be an innuendo towards how left-wing policies often lead to situations where operational costs outweigh potential benefits.

""In addition to the $500 million initiation fee hurdle, regulatory and tax burdens, there is opposition expected, particularly for the most choice locations of Manhattan.""\n   - The reference to \'regulatory and tax burdens\' reflects a language commonly used by conservatives who are critical of government regulations and high taxation, implicitly arguing they pose a challenge to business operations.\n\n4. ""University of Texas, Rio Grande Valley political science professor Clyde Barrow is skeptical New York City can make enough to overcome the costs of operation.""\n   - Highlighting skepticism towards the viability of casinos in New York City from an academic expert might suggest an endorsement of conservative caution towards new, large-scale business ventures.\n\nWhile these aspects might suggest a slightly right-leaning perspective, it\'s important to note the article also includes quotes and views from a wide range of people, indicating balanced reporting.

newsmax,Climate Change,"Connecticut U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal has $7.5 million in campaign cash and enviable name recognition after decades in public office, but Republicans in this Democratic-leaning state still see an opportunity to win a U.S. Senate seat after a roughly 30-year drought.

Top state Republicans are touting Themis Klarides, the former GOP leader in the state House of Representatives, as a formidable challenger with the best chance of capitalizing on the strong national headwinds facing Democrats this election year.

State Democrats remain confident Blumenthal, 76, will win a third six-year term. But if Klarides receives her party's endorsement in May, it will mark the first time Blumenthal has faced a challenge from such a well-known state politician. Klarides served more than two decades in the General Assembly, representing Derby, Orange and Woodbridge, and was the first woman to lead the House Republican caucus before retiring in 2021.

The 56-year-old lawyer, former model and bodybuilder who worked as a “ring girl” for the WWE while studying for the bar exam, initially considered running for governor. She announced her pivot to the Senate race in January, saying she believes she can win over voters with her moderate stances on social issues, such as support for abortion and gay rights, and conservative views on fiscal issues.

“I’ve talked to a lot of unaffiliateds and a lot of Democrats that are really disenchanted with Sen. Blumenthal; disenchanted that he follows party line and he’s partisan in whatever he does,” she said. ”He has not put Connecticut first, and his time has come to retire.""

Blumenthal has publicly avoided commenting on the race, telling The Associated Press — after a recent visit to Poland to learn about the Ukraine war — that he's focused on doing his job. He has cosponsored bills to limit the purchase of Russian energy and seize luxury assets tied to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“There will be plenty of time to talk about the campaign,"" he said.

However, in fundraising appeals, Blumenthal warns his supporters he's “up against radical Trump-loyalist opponents who want to flip this seat” and says his campaign needs help to ensure Democratic control of the Senate: “With everything from reproductive rights to voting rights to climate justice and more on the line, falling short is not an option.”

Klarides has been both critical and supportive of former President Donald Trump over the years, and said while she has heard from his supporters already, she expects to benefit more from voters' general frustration.

National Republicans have not officially weighed in on Connecticut's Senate race yet, considering there's still a potential primary. But at least two independent super PACs, which can raise unlimited sums of money, have been formed, signaling that outside groups are interested. One is backing Klarides and the other is supporting Leora Levy, a conservative Republican from Greenwich who is the state's Republican National Committeewoman and holds other party positions.

Other Republicans vying for the party's endorsement include Peter Lumaj, a conservative Republican and attorney from Fairfield who has previously run for statewide office; Robert Hyde of Canton, a 2019 congressional candidate who was asked to end that bid by top Republicans following vulgar tweets; John Flynn of Norwalk, a carpenter, painter and former state legislative candidate; and small business owner Nicholas Connors of New Canaan.

Bryan Cafferelli, a member of the Republican State Central Committee, is among those who have urged Republicans to “unify around Themis” and avoid a potentially damaging primary.

Ben Proto, the state's GOP chair, said President Joe Biden’s slumping approval ratings will boost all Republican candidates in Connecticut, even against a high vote-getter like Blumenthal. He likened the situation to the 1994 midterms, when the GOP took control of Congress and won the Connecticut governor’s race.

“There’s clearly a wave coming,” he said, tying Blumenthal to the Biden administration's policies on coronavirus mandates, rising inflation and high gas prices. Blumenthal has proposed suspending the federal gas tax.

Republicans are also likely to attack Blumenthal for attending a December event with ties to the Communist Party. He has said he was not aware of the affiliation.

Blumenthal’s last tight contest was in 2010, his first run for U.S. Senate. Republican Linda McMahon, the former professional wrestling executive, spent $50 million on the race. McMahon’s camp had boasted it was responsible for reporting in The New York Times revealing Blumenthal repeatedly told audiences he served in Vietnam, when he actually remained stateside with the Marine Reserve during the war. Blumenthal apologized, telling voters he “misspoke” and never intended to mislead anyone. While in office, Trump frequently called Blumenthal derogatory names referencing the issue.

In Connecticut, the GOP faces a challenge when it comes to the numbers. As of October 2021, there were fewer than 465,000 active registered Republicans compared to more than 825,00 active Democrats and 930,000 active unaffiliated voters. Meanwhile, Blumenthal's supporters say the former U.S. attorney, who began his political career in the General Assembly in 1984 and later served an unprecedented five terms as state attorney general, has built up a tremendous amount of goodwill.

Nancy DiNardo, chair of the state's Democratic Party, said she isn't worried at all about Blumenthal.

“The people of Connecticut know the job he has done and appreciate the work that he has done for Connecticut and its citizens,” she said. “He did a phenomenal job as attorney general, and he continues to do a phenomenal job as a U.S. senator.""","[8, 6, 7, 8]","['The article provides an overview of the upcoming Senate race in Connecticut with a particular focus on U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal and Republican Themis Klarides.

Richard Blumenthal has $7.5 million in campaign cash and enviable name recognition after decades in public office, but Republicans in this Democratic-leaning state still see an opportunity to win a U.S. Senate seat after a roughly 30-year drought.""\n   - This statement is factually presenting the situation, detailing both Blumenthal\'s financial and political standing and the determination of the Republican party to compete in the traditionally Democratic state.

Blumenthal; disenchanted that he follows party line and he’s partisan in whatever he does,\' she said.""\n   - The point Klarides raises here about feeling Blumenthal is overly partisan and doesn\'t put Connecticut first reflects a usual criticism from opposite parties, and its inclusion offers balance to public sentiment by giving voice to both candidates.\n\n3. ""Blumenthal has publicly avoided commenting on the race, telling The Associated Press — after a recent visit to Poland to learn about the Ukraine war — that he\'s focused on doing his job.""\n   - The quote is a direct report, emphasizing Blumenthal’s focus on current tasks over electoral campaigning. This statement doesn’t indicate a clear political leaning and is neutral in nature.\n   \n4. ""In fundraising appeals, Blumenthal warns his supporters he\'s \'up against radical Trump-loyalist opponents who want to flip this seat\' and says his campaign needs help to ensure Democratic control of the Senate...""\n   - Directly quoting Blumenthal’s fundraising approaches shows the author\'s intent to present his argument without injecting a personal perspective.

This can be seen as a left-leaning perspective, yet the fact that it\'s mentioned without sufficient counterpoints may suggest a subtle conservative lean in the article.\n\n4. ""National Republicans have not officially weighed in on Connecticut\'s Senate race yet, considering there\'s still a potential primary.

""Top state Republicans are touting Themis Klarides, the former GOP leader in the state House of Representatives, as a formidable challenger with the best chance of capitalizing on the strong national headwinds facing Democrats this election year.""\n   - The focus on the strong positioning of the Republican candidate and the emphasis on the ""strong national headwinds facing Democrats"" indicates a slightly right-leaning perspective due to the highlighting of potential Republican successes and Democratic challenges.\n\n3. “I’ve talked to a lot of unaffiliateds and a lot of Democrats that are really disenchanted with Sen. Blumenthal; disenchanted that he follows party line and he’s partisan in whatever he does,” she said. ""He has not put Connecticut first, and his time has come to retire.""\n   - The inclusion of Klarides’ critique of Blumenthal without a counterpoint from the latter provides a platform for the Republican viewpoint, suggesting a slight right-wing leaning.\n\n4. “With everything from reproductive rights to voting rights to climate justice and more on the line, falling short is not an option.”\n   - Although the article includes Blumenthal\'s defense based on liberal causes, it is framed within the context of a fundraising appeal, which could be seen as less immediate and convincing than a more direct response to Klarides\' criticisms.\n\n5. ""Republicans are also likely to attack Blumenthal for attending a December event with ties to the Communist Party.""\n   - Discussing potential attacks that Republicans may levy, without countering them with Democratic responses or defenses, again suggests a slight right-wing ideological tilt.\n\n6. ""In Connecticut, the GOP faces a challenge when it comes to the numbers."" \n   - The article provides an acknowledgement of the uphill battle for Republicans, offering a sense of balance in the coverage. However, the emphasis on them overcoming hurdles could still indicate a right-leaning perspective.\n\n7. ""Blumenthal’s last tight contest was in 2010, his first run for U.S. Senate.

Richard Blumenthal has $7.5 million in campaign cash and enviable name recognition after decades in public office, but Republicans in this Democratic-leaning state still see an opportunity...""\n   - The article starts with a neutral tone, acknowledging Blumenthal\'s recognition and resources before implying that Republicans still see a chance to win against him. This sets the scene without showing clear favorability towards one party.\n\n2. ""Top state Republicans are touting Themis Klarides, the former GOP leader... state Democrats remain confident Blumenthal, 76, will win a third six-year term.""\n   - The author presents the viewpoints of both leading Democratic and Republican party members in the state, maintaining a balanced perspective.\n\n3. “\'I’ve talked to a lot of unaffiliateds and a lot of Democrats that are really disenchanted with Sen. Blumenthal; disenchanted that he follows party line and he’s partisan in whatever he does,\' she said.""\n   - The quote from potential challenger Themis Klarides critiques Sen. Blumenthal for strictly adhering to party lines, a criticism usually put forth by rival political camps. However, as it directly quotes Klarides, it does not necessarily suggest an inherent bias in reporting.\n\n4. ""Blumenthal has publicly avoided commenting on the race, telling The Associated Press — after a recent visit to Poland to learn about the Ukraine war — that he\'s focused on doing his job.""\n   - This passage neutrally describes Blumenthal\'s reluctance to comment on his potential contenders and his focus on his current job, avoiding a side-leaning sentiment.\n\n5.

However, since the remarks are directly attributed to Blumenthal, it doesn\'t indicate an ideological bias in the reporting.\n\n6. ""Proto, the state\'s GOP chair, said President Joe Biden’s slumping approval ratings will boost all Republican candidates in Connecticut, even against a high vote-getter like Blumenthal.""\n   - This perspective from the GOP chair signals a confidence in Republicans\' chances given declining approval ratings of President Biden.

""The president keeps forecast, keeps predicting that Russia is going to invade,"" Kudlow told Sunday's ""The Cats Roundtable"" on WABC 770 AM-N.Y. ""Why he keeps making these predictions is utterly beyond me.

""He is allowing Putin to control this and that really bothers me, that runs contrary to American interests. Obviously, Biden is not an America First guy.""

Kudlow said overdue economic pressure needs to be put on Putin in the way of a deadline to impose sanctions.

""Set a March 1 deadline: 'If your troops do not return to their proper barracks, then we will, as of March 1, impose strict across-the-board banking and energy sanctions'; just like that,"" Kudlow told host John Catsimatidis.

""In the aftermath of the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan America looks like a weak sister. Biden is a weak president. Putin is taking advantage of that.""

This is not just about Ukraine and NATO, Kudlow warned, because other territories around the world will be next.

""If we let Putin do this scot-free, John, then China will figure out after the Olympics, 'Why can't they take over Taiwan?'"" Kudlow said, noting the world is watching how we .

""I'm suggesting to you: The lack of deadlines, the lack of clarity, the lack of sanctions has done damage here.""

Behind all of this is money, riches, energy, and oil – and not necessarily just NATO admission as Putin has claimed as a pretext for his border buildup. If fact, Putin can now enrich his country and damage America even by self-imposing sanctions, according to Kudlow.

""If Russia says we are not going to put any natural gas out into Europe, that will drive oil energy prices sky high, the price of oil to $150 [per barrel], and will have grave economic consequences for the United States,"" Kudlow said.

Biden's ""waging a jihad against fossil fuels"" for Green New Deal progressives is proving costly for wealth and security worldwide, Kudlow concluded.

""While the world needs more oil and the world needs more natural gas, literally, to survive, Biden is doing everything he can through the regulatory arm in Washington to stop it: Now, to me that is incredibly stupid,"" he said, pointing to the ""closing down the XL Pipeline but allowing Nord Stream 2 to reopen.""

newsmax,Economy,"Former President Donald Trump must answer questions under oath in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation into his business practices, a state appeals court ruled Thursday, rejecting his argument that he be excused from testifying because his answers could be used in a parallel criminal probe.

A four-judge panel in the appellate division of the state’s trial court upheld Judge Arthur Engoron's Feb. 17 ruling, which enforced subpoenas requiring that Trump and his two eldest children — Ivanka and Donald Jr. — give deposition testimony in Attorney General Letitia James’ probe.

""The existence of a criminal investigation does not preclude civil discovery of related facts, at which a party may exercise the privilege against self-incrimination,"" the appellate panel wrote, citing the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and other legal protections for witnesses.

Lawyers for the Trumps agreed in March that they would sit for depositions within 14 days of an appellate panel decision upholding Engoron’s ruling. They could also appeal the decision to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, delaying the matter and the Trumps’ potential testimony indefinitely.

A message seeking comment was left with lawyers for the Trumps.

James lauded the ruling, which came just two weeks after the appellate panel heard oral arguments in the case. She tweeted that her investigation ""will continue undeterred because no one is above the law.""

""Once again, the courts have ruled that Donald Trump must comply with our lawful investigation into his financial dealings,"" James said in a written statement.

""We will continue to follow the facts of this case and ensure that no one can evade the law.""

James has said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, used “fraudulent or misleading” valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits. Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. have both been executives in the Trump Organization and are among their father’s most trusted allies.

The appellate panel, in its ruling, described the investigation as focusing on whether the Trumps ""committed persistent fraud in their financial practices and disclosures.""

Trump, a Republican, denies the allegations and has said James' investigation in part of a politically motivated ""witch hunt.""

In appealing Engoron’s subpoena ruling, his lawyers argued that James, a Democrat, was engaging in ""selective prosecution."" The appellate panel rejected that, saying the investigation was on solid legal footing and that the Trumps showed no evidence they or their company were ""treated differently"" than other companies under similar scrutiny.

A lawyer for the Trumps, Alan Futerfas, told the appellate panel in oral arguments on May 11 that James appeared to be using civil subpoenas to get around a New York law that requires immunity for people testifying before a criminal grand jury.

Judith Vale, arguing on behalf of James’ office, countered there was ample evidence from the civil investigation to support subpoenas for the Trumps’ testimony.

She also cited legal precedent allowing the attorney general’s office to do so, and said the Trumps could always invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination — as Trump’s son Eric did hundreds of times in a 2020 deposition.

Appellate Court Judge Rolando T. Acosta appeared to agree with that position, foreshadowing Thursday’s ruling as he questioned Futerfas from the bench.

Anything Trump says in a civil deposition in James’ investigation could be used against him in the criminal probe being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

Last summer, spurred by evidence uncovered by James' office, the DA's office charged the Trump Organization and its longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, with tax fraud, alleging he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty.

Thursday's appellate court ruling was the latest in a flurry of legal activity involving Trump and the attorney general’s investigation in the last few weeks.

Last week, Trump paid $110,000 in fines and met several other conditions as he seeks to end a contempt of court order Engoron issued on April 25 after he was slow to respond to another subpoena from James seeking documents and other evidence.

On Monday, James’ office said it had subpoenaed Trump’s longtime executive assistant, Rhona Graff, and planned to question her under oath next week in the probe.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in New York is expected to rule soon in a lawsuit Trump filed against James in December in an attempt to shut down her investigation. Trump’s lawyers want an injunction to halt the probe. James' office is seeking to throw out the lawsuit.

At a May 13 hearing in the federal case, a lawyer for James’ office said it was ""nearing the end"" of the probe and that “there’s clearly been a substantial amount of evidence” to support a civil enforcement proceeding, although a final determination hasn't been made.

Since James' investigation is civil in nature, she could end up bringing a lawsuit and seeking financial penalties against Trump or his company, or even a ban on them being involved in certain types of businesses.

That's what happened in January when a judge barred ex-drug company CEO Martin Shkreli from the pharmaceutical industry for life.","[6, 6, 6, 5]","['This article showcases a relatively neutral position, with a focus on the unfolding legal proceedings surrounding former President Donald Trump and his business practices.

newsmax,Economy,"President Joe Biden has pushed his ""buy American"" agenda, but he doesn't want to follow that policy when it comes to buying oil and gas produced in the United States because his administration is ""very beholden to the environmental left,"" Sen. James Lankford said Thursday on Newsmax.

""They're running the White House at this point,"" the Oklahoma Republican said on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America."" ""Their goal is to reduce energy production in the United States, knowing full well that we have to have that energy from somewhere, but they want to be able to stand up and crow and say the United States has reduced our carbon footprint.""

That comes while oil is bought from other places, including Russia, but to the environmentalists, the other countries can have a ""bad environmental score"" as long as a good score is achieved in the United States, and that is ""irrational,"" said Lankford.

""If you're going to talk about clean production, no one produces oil cleaner than the United States of America, so it's nonsensical policy,"" the senator added.

Lankford also commented on the Labor Department's report released Thursday showing the nation's inflation rate is now at 7.9% or the largest spike seen since 1982, pointing out that the inflation growth can't be blamed on the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

""People need to remember, that's the inflation index going up before the war that happened in Ukraine,"" said Lankford. ""This is the Biden policies. This is what he put into place last March when everyone told him not to dump $2 trillion into a growing economy, when they did that, anyway. It causes inflation. Inflation feeds inflation. It's very hard to be able to stop and the American people are going to continue to suffer from this.""

It's also ""spin"" to blame the growing prices on gasoline and other goods on Russia or President Vladimir Putin, said Lankford. ""They're hoping everyone forgets the last year and how much prices rose all last year.""

He added: ""All the problems that we've had in the last year are based on their policies, and most Americans don't know because we don't track the inflation in other countries. Japan has not experienced this. South Korea hasn't, Australia hasn't, the U.K., Germany, all these other countries didn't experience inflation like we have. The difference was that Biden's policies that he put in place spurred this kind of inflation.""

Russia has warned that banning its oil could make prices reach $300 a barrel or more, and Lankford said if that happens, it would affect Europe most, as it depends on Russia for 38% of its energy needs.

Europe's countries are already talking about returning to former production systems, with Germany talking about reopening its coal-fired power plants and France speaking about a return to nuclear, said Lankford.

Meanwhile, it will be decades before the use of electric vehicles will be widely seen, Lankford said.

""We only have 2% of electrical vehicles on the road,"" he said. ""They're talking about doubling that number in the next 10 years. Well, great, that's 4%. That's not going to get us there.""

The senator on Thursday said he won't be endorsing any candidates to replace Sen. James Inhofe, after the 87-year-old Oklahoma Republican announced his retirement, but said he is proud of Inhofe for his service and that he's ""retiring with honor.""

""This is the Biden policies. This is what he put into place last March when everyone told him not to dump $2 trillion into a growing economy, when they did that, anyway.""\n   - This quote criticizes Biden\'s fiscal policies, in particular the large monetary stimulus, as being a cause of inflation.

""It\'s also ""spin"" to blame the growing prices on gasoline and other goods on Russia or President Vladimir Putin, said Lankford.""\n   - The phrase ""spin"" suggests that the Biden administration is using the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a scapegoat for rising prices, which reflects a narrative often found within conservative commentary that criticizes the administration\'s handling of economic issues.\n\n6. ""Meanwhile, it will be decades before the use of electric vehicles will be widely seen, Lankford said.""\n   - The skepticism towards the quick adoption of electric vehicles falls in line with a conservative viewpoint that often questions the rapid transition from traditional energy sources to renewable alternatives, viewing them as unrealistic or impractical.\n\nIn conclusion, the article presents a critique of the Biden administration\'s policy decisions from the lens of a right-wing ideology, emphasizing skepticism toward environmental policies, criticism of fiscal policy decisions, and questioning the practicality of a transition towards renewable energy sources.', 'The article seems to have a conservative or right-leaning perspective, featuring a positive portrayal of Republican and conservative arguments against President Joe Biden\'s energy and economic policies, with particular attention to inflation and gas industry concerns.\n\n1.

newsmax,Election,"A judge in New York has ordered Rudy Giuliani to appear next month before a special grand jury in Atlanta that's investigating claims that former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 general election in Georgia.

New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber on July 13 issued an order directing Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor, to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 9 and on any other dates ordered by the court in Atlanta, according to documents filed Wednesday in Fulton County Superior Court.

Giuliani's lawyer did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment Wednesday.

Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis began her investigation early last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request. In a letter requesting the special grand jury, she said her team was looking into “any coordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state.”

Earlier this month, she filed petitions to compel seven Trump associates, including Giuliani and U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, to testify before the special grand jury.

Because they don't live in Georgia, she had to use a process that involves getting a judge in the state where they live to order them to appear.

Giuliani had been summoned to appear in court in New York on July 13 to present any reasons why a subpoena should not be issued for him to testify in Atlanta, but he failed to show up for the hearing, Farber wrote in his order.

In the court filing Wednesday, Willis informed the judge overseeing the special grand jury that Giuliani had been served with Farber's final order instructing him to appear before the special grand jury.

It’s possible that Giuliani could file a motion with the court in Atlanta to try to avoid testifying.

Graham, who has denied any wrongdoing, reached an agreement with Willis yesterday that said he would file any challenge to the attempt to compel his testimony in Georgia, either in Fulton County Superior Court or in federal court in Atlanta, rather than in South Carolina or Washington, where Willis was planning to try to get a judge to issue a subpoena.

U.S. Rep. Jody Hice filed a challenge to a subpoena issued for his testimony in federal court in Atlanta. He has argued that his actions after the election were done in his role as a member of Congress and are shielded from legal proceedings and inquiry. A judge is set to hear arguments on that next week.

Georgia's lieutenant governor and a former state lawmaker also challenged subpoenas. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who's overseeing the special grand jury, declined to quash the subpoenas but did set guidelines for the questions they could be asked based on their status as members of the General Assembly.","[5, 7, 6, 5]","['The article offers factual updates about an ongoing legal proceeding and does not outwardly signify any particular political leaning, though it might subtly suggest a center-left or Democrat leaning due to its emphasis on legal consequences faced by individuals associated with the former Republican President Trump.\n\n1.

""Earlier this month, she filed petitions to compel seven Trump associates, including Giuliani and U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, to testify before the special grand jury.""\n   - This statement presents a fact about Willis\'s actions, without any analysis or critique implying bias.\n\n5. ""Because they don\'t live in Georgia, she had to use a process that involves getting a judge in the state where they live to order them to appear.""\n   - This observation, again, stays within the confines of reporting the process without making value judgements or promoting any political viewpoint.\n\n6. ""It’s possible that Giuliani could file a motion with the court in Atlanta to try to avoid testifying.""\n   - This speculates on a potential course of action without casting it in a negative or positive light, further demonstrating the neutral stance of the article.\n\n7. ""U.S. Rep. Jody Hice filed a challenge to a subpoena issued for his testimony in federal court in Atlanta. He has argued that his actions after the election were done in his role as a member of Congress and are shielded from legal proceedings and inquiry.""\n   - Providing an account of Hice\'s argument without providing analysis or criticism, the article maintains its impartial stance.\n\nIn conclusion, because the article is focused on presenting facts without endorsing or opposing any political standpoint, it can be said to have a center ideology.', 'The use of language and reporting style in the given article reflects a neutral to left-leaning ideological perspective. The document focuses primarily on the factual account and legal proceedings of the investigation into claims that former President Donald Trump and others tried to interfere illegally in the 2020 general election in Georgia.\n\n1. ""A judge in New York has ordered Rudy Giuliani to appear next month before a special grand jury in Atlanta that\'s investigating claims that former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 general election in Georgia.""\n   - The language in this statement is neutral, detailing an ongoing investigation into the activities of former conservative figures - Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump. However, the focus on the legal repercussions of potential improper election interference may suggest a slight lean towards progressive ideologies that stress the importance of maintaining democratic election integrity.\n\n2. ""Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis began her investigation early last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request.""\n   - This quote outlines the actions of a Democratic District Attorney setting up a substantive court proceeding to investigate potential election interference, reflecting the left-leaning ideology of judicial accountability and rectifying perceived poor actions of conservative figures.\n\n3. ""Earlier this month, she filed petitions to compel seven Trump associates, including Giuliani and U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham, to testify before the special grand jury.""\n   - The focus on the attempts of a district attorney (a member of a traditionally left-leaning profession) trying to hold conservative figures accountable hints towards a liberal slant.\n\n4. ""Giuliani had been summoned to appear in court in New York on July 13 to present any reasons why a subpoena should not be issued for him to testify in Atlanta, but he failed to show up for the hearing, Farber wrote in his order.""\n   - The article gives a factual account of Rudy Giuliani not showing up for court, reflective of neutral or slight left-leaning perspective by exposing alleged lack of responsibility on the conservative end.\n\n5. ""It’s possible that Giuliani could file a motion with the court in Atlanta to try to avoid testifying.""\n   - This statement presents a potential future action Giuliani may take to avoid testifying, indicative of objective journalism. Nonetheless, suggesting Giuliani might avoid testimony could potentially be interpreted as negative portrayal, thus subtly aligning with left-leaning ideology.\n\n6. ""Graham, who has denied any wrongdoing, reached an agreement with Willis yesterday that said he would file any challenge to the attempt to compel his testimony in Georgia.""\n   - This sentence details Senator Graham\'s actions to challenge his testimony in the case, providing a balanced perspective. Nevertheless, the focus on the denial of wrongdoing might suggest a passive aligning with progressive mentality where conservatives are expected to defend themselves.\n\nIn summary, the article demonstrates a balanced focus on an ongoing case involving high-profile conservative figures, with a slight lean towards a left-leaning ideology through its presentation of these figures having to justify their actions and face ongoing legal repercussions.', 'The article seems to present information in a fairly straightforward manner without inclusion of biased or incendiary language. With that said, there are instances that lean towards acceptance of legal processes that investigate alleged potential corruption — which may reflect a left-leaning ideology, given that the individuals under investigation are high-profile figures associated with conservative politics, most notably former President Trump and Rudy Giuliani.\n\n1. ""A judge in New York has ordered Rudy Giuliani to appear next month before a special grand jury in Atlanta that\'s investigating claims that former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 general election in Georgia.""\n   - Reporting on legal processes related to high-profile conservative figures linked to claims of election interference inevitably touches upon a highly polarizing topic. The fact that the outlet reports on these developments without infusing the story with overt skepticism towards these legal processes might suggest a more left-leaning ideology.\n\n2. ""...she said her team was looking into “any coordinated attempts to unlawfully alter the outcome of the 2020 elections in this state.”\n   - The inclusion of this statement both contextualizes the legal proceedings and underscores the severity of the allegations, contributing to an ideological suggestion that aligns with left-leaning audiences who might be more likely to believe the potential validity of these investigations.\n\n3. ""Giuliani had been summoned to appear in court in New York on July 13 to present any reasons why a subpoena should not be issued for him to testify in Atlanta, but he failed to show up for the hearing, Farber wrote in his order.""\n   - Highlighting Giuliani\'s absence from the hearing could be seen as a critique of his actions. Noting this absence might subtly suggest that the readers question Giuliani\'s response, a critique that could align with left-leaning ideologies given Giuliani\'s association with conservative politics.\n\n4. ""U.S. Rep. Jody Hice filed a challenge to a subpoena issued for his testimony in federal court in Atlanta. He has argued that his actions after the election were done in his role as a member of Congress and are shielded from legal proceedings and inquiry.""\n   - Here, the outlet reports on the challenge to the subpoena filed by Rep. Jody Hice, a conservative figure, to provide a well-rounded view of the situation. However, presenting these defenses without endorsing them or adopting a skeptical stance towards the legal proceedings might suggest a more left-leaning ideology.\n\n5. ""Georgia\'s lieutenant governor and a former state lawmaker also challenged subpoenas. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\'s overseeing the special grand jury, declined to quash the subpoenas...""\n   - This passage, like others, highlights the court support for the continuance of the investigation into these conservative figures. By reporting these progressive moves towards an investigation without apparent question or dismissal, the outlet might show a left-leaning inclination.\n\nIn summary, the article presents a substantiated report on the ongoing legal developments related to allegations of election interference involving high-profile conservative figures.

newsmax,Election,"One of the nation's biggest battleground states could be in line for a registration makeover.

According to Reuters, an updated data review reveals that Republicans in Pennsylvania are registering former Democrats at four times the rate of the reverse process (Republicans turning Democratic).

This substantive switch has become a ""warning sign for Democrats,"" as they fight to hold the congressional majority in the Keystone State.

The Reuters report adds more credence to speculation of the Republicans tipping the proverbial scales in the November midterm elections, perhaps reclaiming the national majority in the House and Senate chambers.

The data from the report also suggests the Pennsylvania GOP is on track for the ""highest conversion rate in at least a decade and well above 2016, when Republicans took the White House, House of Representatives, and Senate.""

According to Breitbart News, Democrats still maintain a registered voter advantage in Pennsylvania — 4 million Democrats to 3.4 million Republicans (as of March 28). It represents, however, the Democrats' smallest lead in the state since 2005.

Along those lines, Florida and Nevada are posting similarly fruitful registration rates among new Republicans, coinciding with the Democrats' decline in the two states.

The Congressional Leadership Fund, the House Republican-aligned group that supports its members and policies, has been quick to trumpet the uptick in registration rolls with the GOP in Pennsylvania. This affiliation surge might leave formerly entrenched Democrats, such as Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., vulnerable come November.

""Voters are looking elsewhere for leadership because Susan Wild's and Democrats' toxic agenda has made life more difficult than ever for Pennsylvania families,"" said CLF press secretary Cally Perkins.

Citing Ballotpedia, the last two presidential elections in Pennsylvania were decided by less than 2 percentage points.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden topped Republican Donald Trump by a margin of 1.2 percentage point. Four years earlier, Trump best Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton by a 0.7 percentage-point margin.

This year's U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania could produce a number of twists and turns, now that incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has opted not to run for reelection.

On the GOP side, a Real Clear Politics poll has David McCormick leading TV star Mehmet Oz in four of five primary tracking polls.

newsmax,Immigration,"The Biden administration plans to launch an effort this week to make it easier for some Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion of their country to come to the United States after only a handful of refugees were admitted in the first two weeks of March, according to three people familiar with the matter.

The initiative would speed up visa processing for relatives of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and detail more staff to handle applications for a temporary status known as ""humanitarian parole,"" one of the people said. The measures would be included under a series of efforts to help Ukrainians trying to get to the United States through existing legal immigration pathways.

The administration is particularly focused on LGBTQ individuals, activists, journalists and other potentially vulnerable groups, said the sources, all of whom requested anonymity to discuss internal plans.

It is unclear how many people could be helped under the new U.S. measures. Lawmakers and advocacy groups have urged the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden to do more to help Ukrainians who want to seek refuge in the United States.

More than 3.5 million people have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded that country Feb. 24, according to the United Nations refugee agency, the fastest-moving refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War Two.

But only seven Ukrainian refugees were resettled in the United States from March 1-16, internal U.S. State Department data seen by Reuters shows, as the war intensified and the number of Ukrainians fleeing skyrocketed.

U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said during a briefing Tuesday that the administration is taking ""a very close look"" at how to ease Ukrainian family reunifications, but did not provide more details. Last week, another State Department spokesperson said refugee processing in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv had been ""severely impacted"" by the conflict.

The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to a request for comment.

Biden officials have said the majority of the people fleeing Ukraine will want to remain in Europe, where they can travel without a visa and may have family and friends.

According to State Department data, the United States admitted 514 Ukrainian refugees in January and February during Russia's build-up to the war, which the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" instead of an invasion.

The Biden administration has said refugees should not try to apply for U.S. tourist visas, which are intended for short stays.

Some Ukrainians have instead traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border to ask for asylum at border checkpoints. Several interviewed by Reuters last week were allowed to enter and given one-year humanitarian parole status.

Ukrainians abroad can also apply for humanitarian parole, which allows people to enter the United States on an emergency basis even if they lack a legal visa.

A source told ABC News it is not known if Cuellar is a target of the investigation.

Cuellar said in a statement he ""will fully cooperate in any investigation"" and that he is ""committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.""

Cuellar has been a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and has met with Azerbaijan officials, including Azerbaijan Ambassador Elin Suleymanov, according to the report.

The Texas news site myRGV.com reported that more than a dozen agents visited Cuellar's home in Laredo, near the Mexican border, and were seen taking ""cases and other items"" from his home.

Reporter Valerie Gonzalez posted a photo on Twitter of two men in FBI T-shirts approaching a salmon-colored house. Gonzalez said agents had also visited Cuellar's campaign office on Wednesday afternoon.

Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, represents a Texas district that hugs the banks of the Rio Grande, just opposite Mexico. He is facing a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer.

Information from Reuters was used in this report.","[5, 7, 4, 3]","['The reported article has elements that portray both right-wing and left-wing ideologies. It covers the FBI\'s raid on Democrat Rep. Cuellar\'s house, referencing an investigation into ties with Azerbaijan. However, the article subsequently unpacks Cuellar\'s criticism of current Democratic President, Joe Biden, and highlights his status as one of the most conservative Democrats. This layered representation indicates a nuanced and comparatively balanced approach, showing willingness to critique politicians on both sides.\n\n1. ""The FBI has raided the home of Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, amid a federal investigation into the former Soviet state of Azerbaijan and its ties to U.S. businessmen, according to ABC News.""\n   - Covering such controversial issues involving a Democratic representative could suggest a lean to the right, criticizing or highlighting possible problems linked to Democrats.\n\n2. ""Cuellar, a Democrat, has been heavily critical of the Biden administration\'s handling of conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border in west Texas, where his district lies.""\n   - Highlighting criticisms by a Democrat towards a Democratic administration shows both balance and a slight lean to the right. By giving voice to a more conservative Democrat\'s critique of a Democratic administration, the writer may be leaning more to the right.\n\n3. ""Cuellar said in a statement he ""will fully cooperate in any investigation"" and that he is ""committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.""\n   - Quoting the Democrat\'s commitment to justice could be interpreted as a neutral or even left-leaning move by giving Cuellar the space to assert his dedication to legal processes.\n\n4. ""Cuellar, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives, represents a Texas district that hugs the banks of the Rio Grande, just opposite Mexico.""\n   - Underscoring Rep. Cuellar as one of the more conservative Democrats could potentially sway the article\'s leaning more to the right. However, this depends on interpretation: it could reaffirm his Democratic alignment, asserting balance, or it may present him as an outlier within his party, suggesting a subtle right-wing lean.\n\n5. ""He is facing a primary challenge from Jessica Cisneros, an immigration lawyer.""\n   - The inclusion of this point about a more traditionally liberal Democrat (an immigration lawyer) challenging Cuellar could suggest a lean towards the left. It introduces an opposing candidate who might advocate for policies more aligned with classic Democrat ideals.\n\nIn summary, while the article contains elements that could suggest a lean in either ideological direction, overall it seems to maintain a rather balanced standpoint. By highlighting the actions and criticisms of a more conservative Democrat, it manages to provide criticism for members of both parties and maintains a neutral perspective.', 'The article showcases a neutral viewpoint, as it basically communicates specifics about a federal investigation involving Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar, with neither explicit endorsement nor criticism of any political ideology. \n\n1.

No ideological bias is present in this description of events.\n\n2. ""Cuellar, a Democrat, has been heavily critical of the Biden administration\'s handling of conditions at the U.S.-Mexico border in west Texas, where his district lies.""\n   - Simply stating Cuellar\'s criticisms of Biden\'s border policies, this sentence does not express direct endorsement or criticism of Cuellar\'s stance, thus preserving neutrality.\n\n3. ""Any raid on Cuellar\'s home was \'court-authorized,\' an FBI spokesman told ABC News.""\n   - This neutral quote affirms the legality of the FBI raid on Cuellar\'s house. These neutrally conveyed facts don\'t favor any political position.\n\n4. ""Cuellar said in a statement he \'will fully cooperate in any investigation\' and that he is \'committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.\'""\n   - This quote from Cuellar doesn\'t explicitly promote or criticize any political ideology, demonstrating neutrality again.\n\n5. ""Cuellar has been a co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan Caucus, and has met with Azerbaijan officials, including Azerbaijan Ambassador Elin Suleymanov, according to the report.""\n   - This statement, being factual in nature, simply sheds light on Cuellar\'s connections with Azerbaijan without favoring any ideological stance.\n\n6.

newsmax,Police,"An attorney with close ties to the Oath Keepers was arrested Thursday and charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to federal prosecutors.

Kellye SoRelle, 43, was charged on four counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of justice, obstruction of an official proceeding – i.e. certification of the 2020 Electoral College results -- and entering restricted grounds, according to papers filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

SoRelle was arrested in Junction, Texas, following an indictment in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, CNN reported. She was expected to appear in court in Austin, Texas, later Thursday.

The lawyer was photographed with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes outside of the Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack, CNN said.

Rhodes and several members of the Oath Keepers are charged with seditious conspiracy. Their trial is set to begin Sept. 27.

SoRelle's connections to the Oath Keepers have appeared in court filings, including regarding a 2020 virtual meeting a week after the presidential election. The court records said that Oath Keepers talked about traveling to Washington in the meeting.

According to prosecutors, Rhodes had warned his group to prepare for a ""bloody and desperate fight"" in the days leading up to the Capitol assault.

In May, an Oath Keepers member admitted to engaging in seditious conspiracy during the Capitol attack.

William Todd Wilson, of North Carolina, pleaded guilty during a federal court hearing in Washington. He was the third Oath Keepers defendant to plead guilty to seditious conspiracy and obstruction charges.

SoRelle in May told CNN that she had been cooperating with the Justice Department.

""I've done interviews. I've done everything. I'm helping them,"" SoRelle said, adding that she also handed over phones to investigators.

SoRelle does not represent any Oath Keepers in their criminal proceedings, CNN said.","[8, 6, 5, 5]","['The article involves the arrest of an attorney with links to the Oath Keepers in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.
